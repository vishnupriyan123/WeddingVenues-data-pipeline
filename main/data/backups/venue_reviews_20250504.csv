V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow what can I say, Brinsop is an absolutely stunning wedding venue with heaps of character and so many options of places for the ceremony and to do things. We fell in love with it as soon as we saw it and knew it was where we wanted to get married.

Right from the start, the Brinsop team were so helpful and accommodating. From giving an virtual tour then showing us around in person, Issy and the team were fantastic right the way through. Nothing was a hassle, no request too difficult and they were incredibly professional and responsive throughout the whole process.

We loved that Brinsop is an exclusive venue with accommodation on site so we could stay with the bridal party and our immediate family. All the rooms are unique and have so much character and it's fun exploring the whole place. You feel like you are in the middle of nowhere, in nature with swans, ducks and birds all around.

Throughout our planning process, Issy and the team helped us every step of the way, being incredibly flexible in managing our requests and really trying to create our vision. They even got their team to make a giant jenga that we could use on the day! They helped to create the most perfect bespoke wedding breakfast and canapes menu, and seemed so positive and excited to be part of our special day and experience.

Arriving at the venue, Issy and the team were ready and had everything prepared and ready to go. It made the process so smooth for us and meant we could really enjoy the day without any stress. Issy coordinated perfectly with all of our vendors and it really felt like she and the whole team were so happy for us and wanted to be part of our day which was amazing. Our guests commented on how friendly and responsive all the staff were and it really made the experience extra special.

I wouldn't change anything about the day and it was perfect. I would absolutely recommend Brinsop as a wedding venue and all the staff who are really invested in helping deliver your vision. Thank you so so much to the whole team for making this a day that we will look back on for many years to come with amazing memories."
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow, what a perfect day we had! It really went without a hitch and that was thanks to Nina and all the staff at Brinsop. The team worked seamlessly to ensure the day was as perfect as could be, and it really was! The wedding was booked over 2 years in advance and the staff were so accommodating with all my questions, planning and site visits, they couldn’t do more to support us. Special thanks to our coordinator Nina who was a delight to work with and a credit to Brinsop. Everyone that attended agreed at how beautiful the venue and grounds were, it was a wedding people won’t forget! 10/10 would recommend to anyone!"
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"It's taken me quite a while to get round to writing this review, because sadly it's quite a bittersweet one.

We were married last year on 15 June and Brinsop was our chosen venue for both our ceremony and reception. We were first attracted to brinsop by the accomodation, meaning our loved ones could stay on-site, especially my grandparents which was so important to me.

The home itself is absolutely beautiful, including ivy cottage which myself and my mum stayed in the night before the big day. It really was a picture perfect setting, and looking down from the bridal suite seeing the ceremony space being set up on the Wordsworth lawn was honestly magical. Id dreamed of an outdoor wedding on that lawn, and we were so grateful the weather cleared so we could have it. The team really did wait till the latest they could to ask us to make a call on an inside or outside wedding (despite being June, it was a gloomy day to start) which I really appreciated!

Another amazing part of hiring brinsop was the after hours space we were able to enjoy until 2am with our house guests. The games room was absolute fantastic and meant that if you wanted to go to bed you could, but you could also stay up, party and play pool. I really do think this was a highlight for our guests and would recommend massively if you can spare some budget.

On the night of the wedding, myself and my new husband actually stayed in one glamping tents which we absolutely loved. The groundsman was on site until we were ready to leave the games room, and he then took us up to our tent in one of the buggies, making sure we had plenty of blankets and even stopping off for some bottles of water for us. This was really special, and can't thank him enough.

Hugo Spritz!! Having hugos at both our welcome drinks and drinks reception after the ceremony was amazing. I'm not a fan of prosecco myself and Mark and the team made it possible for us to have Hugo's all round. We even sneaked some up to the bridal suite to have before the ceremony (thanks Nadia!). Our guests loved them, and the amount of people that have told me they now need them at their own wedding is crazy!

Onto the not so good - sadly it all started to go a little downhill when we moved things into the knot barn for our wedding breakfast. Sitting on the top table, I could see that guests at the top of the second rows of long tables didn't really even have a seat around the table and were just kind of plonked on. The seating plan hadn't been followed, and I don't think there were even enough tables laid for the service to be comfortable for people because there was a dance floor at the end of the barn (which I did not ask for).

It was quickly also brought to my attention, that one of our guests had had to put her child on her lap in order to remove the high chair so people had more space. We also lost about 5 napkins with them setting on fire from the candles because everything was just way too cramped.

I asked to speak to catering, and asked if there was anything that they could do. I was told 'well sure, if you want the whole thing to be late'. In truth I shouldn't have even had to broach this myself, as it should have been sorted by the coordination team.

The tables weren't changed, even after they'd said they'd sort after the first course and yet the whole meal still ran late. We've had so much feedback about people not having enough food, food not being easy to access on the sharing platters etc and honestly when you've waited so long for a day and had spent 25k on the venue and food alone, it really has been heartbreaking to hear. I do sometimes question why people still bring it up (even now, people talk about the dining) when it clearly upset me so much.

Whilst writing this review my husband asked my what we had for evening food - we didn't get any. It was left unannounced on a back table. I don't know what I was expecting, just not that.

The next morning, the houseguests were asked to come down to breakfast for 9am (it was on a note in the room) but as we were in the glamping area, we walked past the knot barn just before 8.30 and the food was already out. We ran down to the house to hurry everyone up, and by which time everyone arrived it had been sitting there for 20plus mins going cold.

My biggest upset was that when I fed all of the above back to brinsop, feeling pretty deflated about the catering, I was told they'd pass my feedback on and heard absolutely nothing back. 25k total with over 10k on food and drinks to hear absolutely nothing, and this was 9 months ago. I'm not saying this in would happen to anyone else, but really - it shouldn't have happened to us either."
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our wedding! From start to finish, everything at Brinsop was flawless. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most magical backdrop for our special day. Our guests were blown away by the beautiful venue, the warm atmosphere, and the seamless coordination. Every detail was taken care of, and we felt so well looked after. The team was incredible, professional, friendly, and attentive. On the day itself, they ensured everything ran smoothly, allowing us to truly enjoy every moment. A special mention goes to our amazing wedding coordinator Nina!"
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We had our wedding on New Year's Eve 2024 at Brinsop, and it was more perfect that we could have ever hoped for. The venue itself is stunning, with beautiful spacious rooms which slept over 40 of our guests. Our coordinator, Nina, was incredible and so supportive on the day - she kept everything running so smoothly and everything went by without a glitch. The food and drink managers Mark and Amy did the most incredible job - nothing was ever too much, they were so attentive, and the chefs the most stunning meal after we gave them a fairly vague brief of 'curry'! We had the most perfect day and we're so incredibly grateful to Brinsop and the team."
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,Brinsop Court is pure magic—an unforgettable venue with an incredible team!
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We were lucky enough to have our wedding at Brinsop Court in December, and it was an absolutely spectacular day. We fell in love with Brinsop as soon we set our eyes on the beautiful manor and surrounding gardens. Cate, Amy, Mark and the rest of the wonderful staff at Brinsop really go the extra mile to make you feel special, and are extremely flexible with requests in order to make your day feel more special. We honestly felt like there was no request too big leading up to the day and they really made us feel extremely comfortable leading up to the day.
On the day, Cate and her team were well on hand to help us with setting up everything and she had everything under control when there were a few hiccups. The day itself was absolutely magical, and that wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for everyone at Brinsop working extremely hard to ensure that everything went to plan and as smoothly as it could.
Thank you to everyone at Brinsop for making us feel at ease and ensuring that our wedding was an amazing day."
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Brinsop, the perfect wedding venue! We got married at Brinsop in December and I can honestly say it was everything we could have hoped for and more. We found out about the venue through Hitched and was one of only two venues that we visited but as soon as we got the house we knew it was the one. We fell in love with everything about it and it was fair to say that our guests agreed with us with many saying it was the nicest venue they’d been to. We had the wonderful Nina as our coordinator and she was brilliant! Nothing was too much trouble and we had constant communication with her in the build up which helped our stress levels no end. The same can be said for all of the staff who were brilliant throughout and allowed us to have the best day of our lives with everything running seamlessly. A special mention must be given to Amy and the catering staff who put on such an incredible menu (including the tasting session that provided some of the best food we’d ever had) and ensured that the food has been one of the main things that people have mentioned to us since the wedding! We had our ceremony in the Banqueting Hall which provided the perfect setting, especially with it being a winter wedding, as it really added to the cosy atmosphere and the lounge areas/games room were perfect for the drink’s reception. We would have loved to have also had it in the courtyard, but the temperatures meant that the lounge with the fireplace was a far more appealing option on the day. We then had the wedding breakfast and reception in the knot barn which was decorated beautifully and was the perfect place for the party in the evening. Overall we really can’t thank everyone at Brinsop enough for making our day what it was, we can honestly say that we have been made to feel part of the family and already can’t wait to hopefully come back to stay in one of the cottages for our first anniversary!"
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Where do I start!!
Brinop Court is the most stunning venue, it was the first venue we visited and instantly fell in love! Theres so much history to the house and we were treated like family every time we visited before the wedding and it literally felt like home the whole weekend of the wedding, my guests also agreed!!

A special thank you to Issy our coodinator who went above and beyond ti make sure everything was perfect for us. It was so easy to plan and nothing was too much to ask, even arranging our dog to be our ring bearer!! When they say Brinsop is dog friendly they really mean it!!!

What a place, what a day!! Thank you so much everyone, you all made our day perfect and it really was the best day of our lives♥️"
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We got married at the gorgeous Brinsop in October this year. It’s hard to put into words how amazing the whole experience was. We honestly had the best day of our lives!!!

We fell in love with Brinsop during our first visit back in December 2022. We knew almost immediately that Brinsop was the venue we were looking for! From the outside the venue looked like a painting - from the picturesque views of the countryside, to the swans swimming on the moat! The manor house itself has so much character, and has a lovely homely feel to it as you walk around it. Our guests were equally blown away by the venue!

A big thing for us was that it’s dog friendly, which meant we could have our two dogs join us on our special day, it wouldn’t have been the same without them there! They had so much fun walking around the grounds and greeting all of our guests!

Nina, our coordinator, and her team were always available to answer any of our questions in the run up to the day. This really put us at ease, knowing we were in safe hands. On the day, Nina and the team made sure everything ran smoothly and went above and beyond to ensure our guests were looked after. A shout out to Amy who heads up catering and Mark who manages the bar. The food and drinks were absolutely fantastic!

I highly recommend this venue! There’s a reason Brinsop is an award winning venue - and when you visit it’s not hard to see why. We are already looking forward to going back there for a date night next year! Thanks for everything Team Brinsop!

V2,The Manor at Bickley,"The Manor is the perfect venue for weddings! When our wedding venue fell through 4 months before the big day, I stumbled onto the Manor at Bickley and spoke to Craig. He was most helpful and kind and went above and beyond to make sure our wedding went ahead.

We hired the venue for our two day wedding and the staff were helpful and accommodating from start to finish. All of our guests were awed by the beautiful well kept grounds and the excellent service. We can’t thank the staff enough for making our wedding dreams a reality. They thought of every detail from bringing us champagne after our civil ceremony to making sure we had our card box at the end of the night! We are excited to head back to celebrate our anniversary there!"
V2,The Manor at Bickley,"Myself and my Husband chose this venue for our wedding last week and we can’t sing The Manor’s praises enough. From our very first enquiry, to the first viewing of the venue, right though until the big day, the staff at the manor have been nothing short of brilliant! Each staff member we came across was polite and accommodating. Special mention to Craig and Vicky with whom we did most of our liaising throughout the months leading up until our wedding. Craig and Vicky were super helpful, responsive and went above and beyond to make sure that we could have the day of our dreams. Even with last minute changes due to the weather, Craig who was just incredible throughout, managed to help us sort a backup plan so our day would still go ahead seamlessly.

The rooms at the manor were spacious and modern, giving us and our wedding party lots of space for photographers and videographers to capture the special moments on our wedding morning.

The lodge that was used for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready was fabulous. The manor was very flexible in giving us early access so we could get ready on time.

The grand marquee was definitely grand! Very spacious and when decorated looked like something out of a fairytale! lots of kitchen space, a huge bar and fantastic overhead speakers for the party!

The manor was super flexible to our needs regarding access, start times, outsourcing our vendors and much more. The venue is beautiful and spacious with options for outdoor and indoor events and entertainment. The grounds were absolutely beautiful, so many lovely spots for photos not only for us as the bride and groom but for guests too!

A very special thank you to our point of contact throughout, Craig. From our first meeting, he was charming, bubbly and made us feel super welcome. He reassured us that he has experience in African/Caribbean weddings and that our wedding day would amazing and it was. He was attentive and always let us know that he was only a phone call or e-mail away and was always quick to respond and answer any questions we had.

All in all, we had the most beautiful day at The manor and we would definitely recommend this venue for a wedding or other events.

V2,The Manor at Bickley,"We hired The Manor at Bickley for my daughters wedding. Got a brilliant service from the venue. Everything was set accordingly, as per floor plan. Our guests were loved the venue grounds/facilities and the overall wedding set up.
Thank you to everyone at Bickley."
V2,The Manor at Bickley,"A warm and friendly service from the very helpful staff, a feeling that it is your own house! The food was amazing and the atmosphere made us and our guests feel fantastic."
V3,Davenport House,We are so pleased we chose Davenport House for our wedding reception. Charley and the team were so helpful and thoughtful. Putting canapés behind the bar for us and making sure everything ran so smoothly. I am obsessed with the stunning house and grounds and it was absolutely perfect! Thank you so much for making our day so special!!
V3,Davenport House,"Davenport House is a STUNNING wedding venue so how could we not have it for our big day!?

The staff were exceptional! From the moment we booked through to our big day, we had an absolute blast and could not thank each member of staff enough! Special shout out to Jared (hopefully spelt right, haha!) who made sure we were fed, watered and ensured we took 5 minutes to ourselves every moment we could - Also even saved us slices of pie wedding cake before we went to bed!

Our guests have said they have never been to a wedding so spectacular, with the most amazing food and amazing staff so could not have been happier having Davenport as our venue! 🩷"
V3,Davenport House,"I just wanted to write to say a huge, enormous thank you to Charley and all the team at Davenport House. We still can’t believe how perfect our day was, and lots of our guests have told us it’s the best wedding they’ve ever been to. The team were all a huge part of making that happen. It was incredibly seamless and well planned on the day, meaning we genuinely didn’t have to think about a thing, except for enjoying ourselves. The day ran to schedule perfectly and even certain touches we didn’t know or expect to happen were planned by you and the team, which made the day even more special. Thank you so much for giving us our dream wedding day. We can’t wait to see the full set of pictures and the video now to relive it all!"
V3,Davenport House,"Without doubt the best day of our lives. From start to finish, Davenport has exceeded expectations. From the very first impression of the venue during the open day, the incredible food tasting evening, all the way through to the day itself, including the support and preparation leading up to it. It was really important to us to pick a venue that not only ticked the fairytale box, but also come with the complete support of a wedding planner, due to our busy jobs. We were lucky enough to have Charley as ours. She really took the time to listen and get to know us, to ensure the day was tailored to exactly what we wanted. We even had our own cocktail designed, which went down an absolute storm on the day! She considered every little detail, constantly putting our minds at ease, which made the whole process so easy and enjoyable. Honestly the day couldn’t have gone smoother, any anxiety or stress faded immediately as soon as we got to the venue. It was simply perfect. So many of our guests were complimentary of just how beautiful the venue is and just how well organised the day was, and that is the perfect way to summarise Davenport. Any prospective couples thinking of selecting Davenport as their venue, hesitate no further. It will be a day you never knew was possible! We cannot thank you enough Charley and the Davenport team, if only we could live the day over and over again"
V3,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was amazing. When looking for a venue we weren't just looking for something wow, we needed to have people who were enthused and passionate about their work - we found that at Davenport House.

From our first phone call & meeting with Lizzie and Tallulah, we knew this was the place for us. Having two brides wasn’t an issue; combining British, Asian and Spanish cultures - wasn't an issue; having brides enter together – wasn’t an issue. Nothing was an issue. At Davenport House, we got it all – a picturesque venue and the best team of staff anyone could ever wish for. All our external suppliers have commented what a fantastic venue you are. All out guests have said that the service and attention to detail was second to none. The thoughtful touches like hiring a Spanish speaking waiter for the table which spoke very little English ensured that everyone felt welcomed. Guests with dietary requirements didn't feel they got a second rate meal or they were an afterthought - the food for all throughout the day was exceptional. The rooms / cottages where our guests and we stayed, spotless and comfortable. The thought behind adding some cheese and Spanish ham to the morning breakfast - so sweet!

Special shout out to Megan - wedding planner extraordinaire who kept in touch throughout the planning process and was exceptional on the day. Ian who worked tirelessly to ensure the day ran smoothly and the food was perfect, Charley who was also in charge of one bride and ensuring that everything was on point. All the staff were fantastic - polite, professional and personal.

Everyone keeps saying that this was the best wedding they have ever attended and that’s a lot of weddings between people! When we asked why, they say things like ‘the venue’, ‘the staff’, but it all came back to the inclusivity, love & joy that they felt – and you were all a part of that.

Davenport House is a stunning venue made even better by those who work there. If you want the whole package on your wedding day, we strongly recommend you book them.

Thank you to the entire Davenport House team.

Sat and Ana xx"
V3,Davenport House,"Where to begin with our beautiful venue and thanking the people who made it all happen! We got married in November at Davenport House and it was easily the best day of our lives. We chose Davenport because we wanted to host our cosy winter wedding in a big grand house in the country, with all the grandeur and class but to still feel like an intimate celebration with our family and closest friends, and it was perfect in delivering just that. It is utterly beautiful, the location was perfect and exactly what we wanted. The food was absolutely AMAZING, we had so many compliments from our guests and we are so grateful for the team in delivering such a fabulous wedding breakfast. Thank you so much to Lizzie who couldn’t do more to help us have our dream day, and Ian who delivered the best service to us and our guests (the pizza at 2am was very much appreciated)

Massive massive thank you to Charley our wedding planner, who was so so helpful throughout our wedding planning process and on the day, I can’t thank her enough. She was always there whenever I needed her, helped me so much with creating our dream day and I will be forever grateful to her for keeping me sane! Whenever I had any worries I knew she was just a phone call away, which helped me a lot when planning a wedding!

Charley, Lizzie and Ian thank you for everything - best team ever. Our day was seamless and it was all down to you and your incredible team.

Jess and Sam xx"
V3,Davenport House,"Me and my (now) wife chose Davenport House as our wedding venue in mid 2022, to get married in September 2023, and it was the best decision we could have made. We looked at a range of Georgian style manor house type venues located in Cheshire, North Wales and the West Midlands areas. It blew all of the competition away in terms of the venue aesthetics, the balance in design (i.e. period characteristics vs modern design), the impressive condition of the property for its age plus what it offered for our wedding weekend.

Staff and service - In the UK, this is usually something that is average at best - if you're lucky. At Davenport House, the service from all staff was 10/10. I honestly don't think we've ever had better service for anything. We had a wedding planner from the start (Megan), who was an absolute saint and was fundamental in making the whole wedding a success. She was also instrumental in helping us find a way for our 'little' dog Bernie to be a part of the main event. Thanks Megan!

Accommodation - The fantastic condition, design and decor for Davenport House extends to all areas of the estate. The rooms are fantastic, very big, well maintained and cleaned religiously by the venue. We had no issues or problems from all of the guests who stayed onsite over the 3 days.

Food and drink - This got a lot of deserved praise from the guests too. We got to tailor our entire menu and it worked perfectly for what we wanted for the 3 days. The oyster bar and luxurious charcuterie board went down particularly well the day before the wedding.

I could keep writing much, much more on how fantastic this venue was for our wedding. But the best advice I could give for any interested couples is to go and visit it in person and reach out to Davenport House with any questions. Our own wedding ended up becoming both perfect and the best wedding we've ever been to. Thanks guys again!"
V3,Davenport House,"Fantastic location.
Great staff.
Beautiful place to get married.
I can wait to film here again soon thanks for having me."
V3,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was a fairytale, everything we could have dreamed of and more. Lizzie and Charley were fantastic in their support, organisation and professionalism in planning our wedding. The venue is simply spectacular- breathtaking. Our guests were blown away. The day ran so smoothly it was simply perfect. The food was out of this world our guests couldn't get enough. All the staff at the house went above and beyond to ensure we were happy and having a great day. The team were also extremely supportive of last minute changes/additions. The Davenport experience was truly wonderful and I'm sad to see it end right from our initial meetings, food tasting and finally our special day. Thank you: Lizzie, Charley, Ian and all of the team for a truly memorable day for us and our guests. Mr and Mrs Kissane"
V3,Davenport House,"We got married at Davenport House in February and they provided us with the most perfect day. Lizzie, Charley, Ian and the rest of the team were the best hosts we could have hoped for. Nothing was too much to ask and the guests all commented on the hospitality shown to them. The setting is utterly gorgeous, our weather was less than favourable so we did not make the most of the grounds but this didn't matter, the house was setting enough and so atmospheric! The food was utterly AMAZING and better than most restaurant food I have eaten. The venue feels intimate and grand at the same time.
I literally cannot recommend this place enough, they gave us the wedding we had always wanted and more!"

V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge on 12 May 2023 and it was incredible. The views are gorgeous and the photo opportunities are endless with beautiful floral and green surroundings. The team were super responsive throughout the process which is really reassuring and helpful when planning a wedding, and Nelson who ran the day was just fantastic. Every single detail was thought of and they run a really slick operation. This is essential as it meant I had a lot less to think about! They put me and my partner at ease throughout. The food and service on the day was fantastic, so many of our guests said this was the best food they’ve ever had at a wedding. Highly recommend! (Photos by Costa Weddings UK)"

V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge in October 2024. The whole day was magical, including the beautiful view over the autumn trees in Richmond Park. Robert made sure everything ran perfectly and helped us to find slots in the busy wedding timetable to fit in some special moments to also reflect traditions from my husband's Dutch culture. The food was great and the staff were polite and fun. All preparation with Lucy was also smooth and done with a smile. The Pembroke Lodge team ooze experience but make every wedding feel special and really listen to your wishes for the day. Highly recommend! Thank you to the whole Pembroke Lodge team, especially Robert, Lucy, the kitchen team and the staff on the day!"
V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park",The staff has been very helpful. They have a lot of experience. Open to any suggestions and help in critical situations.
V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue than Pembroke Lodge for our summer wedding. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most gorgeous backdrop for our special day. A huge thank you to our banqueting manager, Nelson, who went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly.

The team was incredibly supportive and accommodating throughout the planning process, making it an enjoyable and stress-free experience. Their professionalism and attention to detail made all the difference, and we’re so grateful for everything they did to make our day unforgettable. Highly recommend!"
V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We got married on the 3rd of October this year, and the team made our day magical! What a smooth day. We loved every second of it! The guests loved everything, and raved about the food and organisation.
Hiring Pembroke Lodge was easy. We had a viewing where all information was shared in detail and super clear to understand and make a decision.
On the months leading up to the big day our contact was Alice. Alice is a star. Responsive, professional, and had answers and solutions to everything.
On the day, Nelson coordinated the whole thing, minute by minute, and we are forever grateful for his politeness, professionalism and high spirits. We felt safe and in good hands. I would give Pembroke Lodge way over 5 stars if I could :)"
V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","My wedding went without a hitch, thanks to the amazing team at Pembroke Lodge (special thanks to Nicola & Robert)! They made sure everything was set up perfectly on the day, exactly in the way we had requested, and then ensured the day itself went as smoothly as we could've hoped. Everything looked beautiful and the stunning views made all of our guests fall in love with the venue too."
V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had the most perfect day. The team have all been so responsive and accommodating of our every request. The venue is beautiful and we were lucky to have gorgeous sunset views. It is truly a countryside wedding but conveniently close to London, which was important for our overseas guests. The food was fantastic and staff were professional and efficient. Would recommend to anyone."
V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We recently had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge, and I cannot say enough good things about the venue, the team and manager, Robert. From the moment we started planning to the big day itself, he was absolutely incredible.

Robert went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. He was always available to answer our questions, offer solutions, and provide creative suggestions that enhanced our vision. He coordinated effortlessly with our vendors, making sure everyone was on the same page, which took so much stress off our shoulders.

On the day of the wedding, he was a true rockstar! He made sure the timeline flowed perfectly, from setting up the ceremony space to ensuring the reception transitions were seamless. His dedication and hands-on approach allowed us to enjoy every moment without worrying about a single thing.

Our wedding was a dream come true, and we owe so much of that to him and the team! Thank you, for everything you all did to make our day magical."
V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We could not have wished for a better wedding venue for our special day! Everyone went above and beyond to make sure our day goes perfectly without us having to worry about a single thing! A big shoutout to Nelson who was absolutely brilliant and made the day feel so calm and well thought through.

The food was delicious and all the team was so welcoming and super helpful on the day.

Thank you so much, we really really appreciate all the help!"
V6,The Hackney,"If you are having a wedding for under 60 people then this is your place! From start to finish the communication and planning of the wedding was seamless and took so much of the stress out of the day. The totally customisable packages that they offer really does suit anyone’s budget and more importantly regardless of what package you end up going for it is value for money. The food was delicious and it catered to everyone’s tastes including a pregnant guest, halal, vegan and lactose intolerant and was the talking point for our guests. The venue itself is stunning! Lots of exposed brick, they had recently redecorated before our wedding and the reception room that doubled up as the dance floor was styled simply but made a statement and the outdoor covered patio area was a welcome addition. The team understood our vision from the get go and they completely nailed it, all of our guests couldn’t believe it was here! I honestly can’t recommend it enough if you’re wanting a small and intimate wedding venue but still with all the class. I would say to future couples even if you think this wouldn’t be your venue please please do have a proper look because it will change your mind, I had come across this venue multiple times over the course of a year and decided to take a leap of faith and give it a chance and we’re so happy we did."
V6,The Hackney,"We can’t recommend the Hackney highly enough. They made the whole process so easy and they offer so much in-house which we took advantage of. The food was especially great - our guests were amazed “best food I’ve ever had at a wedding” and the team took great care of us during the planning stages.

They offer a very customisable service with scalable pricing. If you’re having a fairly small wedding (under 60) then you must check out The Hackney.

We had such a perfect day and we owe so much of that to the fabulous venue. Beautiful space, so professionally run."
V6,The Hackney,"We had such a brilliant experience working with the team at The Hackney. We were regularly in touch throughout the planning process and the use of the shared spreadsheet was especially handy for keeping everyone informed.
We had to postpone our wedding two days before as we were both sick with COVID, and the team were just fantastic. They waited for us to recover and then we started to talk through options again. We were able to rebook just six months after our original date, and the team were accomodating and understanding throughout the process.
The day itself was perfect. Lots of our guests commented on the quality and quantity of the food and Hugo was great at keeping everything to time. We wish we could do it all again."
V6,The Hackney,"We had our wedding reception here and wow was it amazing. Hugo, Erika and the whole team were amazing. Every single guest commented on how delicious and plentiful the food was. The staff were amazing nothing was too much to ask and all so happy.
The venue itself was decorated amazingly, given we left our wedding stationary etc up to the venue it exceeded our expectations. I was concerned about the allowed decibel level for Dj / entertainment but it was plenty loud enough. I wish I could relive the day again, if you’re thinking about booking The Hackney do it! You will not regret!"
V6,The Hackney,"We held our wedding reception at The Hackney in July and it was truly the best experience. We opted for a standing reception for our 65 guests, serving food bowl-style for a more relaxed, less formal feel. The food was absolutely delicious and there was lots of it - it just kept coming! Our guests are still raving about how good the food was months later! Lots of good drinks options too - we especially like the cocktails here!

The staff on the night were so friendly, welcoming and were amazing with our children guests too!

The Hackney is such an aesthetic venue with exposed brick walls and existing foliage which we loved, so we kept additional decorations to a minimum. We dropped our decorations to The Hackney the day before and picked them up the day after, which was super easy! We hadn’t given them too much direction with where we wanted everything placed but when we turned up to the venue on the day it was truly perfect! The staff know exactly what they’re doing and had decorated it beautifully! The outdoor seating area is a great feature too (especially for our two greyhounds who chilled out there for the majority of the reception!)

We opted for a simple Spotify playlist for our music and their sound system was good.

The wedding planning process was super easy from start to finish, with continued support and check-ins from Hugo, from the moment we booked, to the day itself! We really enjoyed the menu tasting experience earlier in the year too, which is a great touch in the build up to the big day! The planning spreadsheet was easy to use and made us feel content and relaxed, knowing that everything was under control.

Overall, we would highly recommend The Hackney to anyone looking for an affordable, dog-friendly, wedding reception venue with a laidback vibe, delicious food and lovely friendly staff! We look forward to coming back every year to celebrate our anniversary, with an espresso martini!"
V6,The Hackney,"We hosted our wedding reception with the team at the hackney in May 2023. The planning experience was straight forward and easy to book. The availability for the venue is on the website so easy to see when they have and get it booked. We went with the 5 canapés, bowl food menu, and drinks on arrival with wine through the event. The staff were brilliant and food delicious.

We loved the vibe of the venue as we wanted a bit more of a casual event, with a relaxed feel and we were able to host our 85 guests with no issues (although limited to standing event at this size, there is enough scattered seating for anyone to sit when they wanted).

In terms of decorating, we didn't feel the need to add any extra flowers as the venue was already so made up with plants and other decorations.

We did add the photo box which I highly recommend, was great fun for our friends and family and came with a memory book. People were shy at first but really got into it. We also used the recommended baker who provided a delicious cake.

Final area to mention - pricing. Wedding venues can be really expensive and daunting before you even start paying for any food or drink. Something that really attracted us to this venue was the low spacing cost and the minimum spend with it. It meant that we were able to completely customise the experience and see where the money we were spending was going. There are many different options and packages to go with, so it's up to you.

Only thing that wasn't offered was any tasting of the food beforehand which we would've liked to have done but none the less, the food was delicious so it wasn't really needed!

To finish, we loved every moment of it and hope that many others get to experience the same. Thank you very much team at the hackney!"
V6,The Hackney,"We had our reception in July. The venue was cosy and comfortably fit 30 people without feeling too crowded or too empty (we were worried it might be too empty). We managed to fit a band in, arranged mini-golf in the venue after dinner, and customize the cocktail menu with custom recipe (that we provided before hand).

One of the biggest highlights was the food. The crispy roast pork got so many complements and indeed it was tasty. But really, all the dishes were amazing (we had a tasting session prior), it was hard to choose, but the taste of each dish was still top notch on the day itself too. I heard that the supper snacks we ordered were great too but alas, I was too busy and they were snapped up instantly!

Some other details:
* We were allowed to use the small room downstairs as a private space to put our stuff. Very handy to not mess up items.
* We went with a bar tab and kept increasing the budget each time till the end of the night instead of the all-you-can-drink. From our rough calculations, it worked out about the same going for all-you-can-drink. Of course, certain folk were heavy weights and more than made it up will be different for each crowd.
* Lighting for photos came out excellent (combination of photographer and venue lighting).
* You can adjust air conditioning to suit the weather (we had ours on the warm side due to older folk not dealing with cold too well).
* Outdoor space was a pleasant change in atmosphere for those who wanted some fresh air.

What about the review from the Bride? Bride approved this review."
V6,The Hackney,"The day was fabulous - Hugo was brilliant and flexible with what we were after. The tasting day before was such a great idea and the whole experience and guidance given made planning a wedding in c.5 months so much easier. We had vegans, last minute drop outs, ridiculously hot weather, about 3 different spotify playlists, a string quartet, florists arriving in the morning and a cake that arrived the day before - the team took it all in their stride and it seemed like a breeze. Loved it all and we've had such good feedback from guests. A fabulous whirlwind.

Two very minor points for feedback - we maxed out the guest numbers (the team did advise us against it but were very accommodating despite us also throwing musicians into the mix) and it was a little too crowded pre-lunch on such a hot day. We also put some speeches in between courses (again, we were recommended against it) and that may have been a slight mistake for the dessert timings, as the tasting day was 10/10. But, it was a perfect day in a stunning venue. Loved it - thank you guys."
V6,The Hackney,"Jon and the team were absolute superstars, hosting the perfect wedding day for us. The space is beautiful, the decor is modern and perfect. They were so accommodating for any request or question we had which we really appreciated. Guests commented on how great the cocktails were! The day ran so smoothly and we had a fantastic time."
V6,The Hackney,"From the initial phonecall to the warm welcome we got when we first visited The Hackney, we knew we were in safe hands and that we’d made the perfect choice. The venue offers the most beautiful interiors - the perfect mix of cosy, intimate and modern industrial - exactly what we were looking for!

Our entire experience with The Hackney was an absolute dream -we loved the mega organised approach to planning. Something that could have been incredibly intimidating was made so straightforward with the amazing support of Hugo the General Manager who embraced all our weird and wonderful suggestions and gave expert advice on what we could do to make things even better. We left every meeting buzzing with ideas and even more excited to welcome our closest friends and family to the big day.

The quality of the food and drinks is impeccable - every single one of our guests (even the fussiest!) has commented on how much they loved it. We absolutely loved the menu tasting, even though it made the decision even harder as everything was amazing. What makes it even better for us is living close by and being able to pop into our wedding venue for a coffee or a cocktail!

I couldn't recommend The Hackney enough - I just wish we could go back and do it all again!"
V7,PYRÁ,"We held our wedding reception at Pyra. We booked the entire venue, with the upstairs loft serving as a dance floor with bar and downstairs having tables and seating for guests.  Canapes were served upstairs and a buffet dinner was served downstairs.  We lucked out with great April weather, so guests were also able to enjoy Pyra’s patio and additional space on Lonsdale Road. We were very happy with our decision to have our reception at Pyra, and many of our guests commented on how lovely the space was, how nice the staff were, and how delicious the food was.
 
The venue:
The space is gorgeous with lots of natural light upstairs.  Guests arrived at 4pm but we had the venue for the entire day, and Pyra gave our florist access earlier to set up beautiful flower arrangements and candles - it looked stunning.  Pyra set up our welcome sign and card box too. The venue also accepted delivery of our cake on the morning of the wedding which was a huge help, set it up very nicely upstairs, and cut it for us after the formal “cake cutting” shots.  We were able to coordinate with Pyra ahead of time to arrange the space how we wanted, such as how many tables we wanted downstairs and the set-up of the loft upstairs.  They even had a microphone ready for us upstairs so we could say a few words to our guests before our cake cutting. Perfect! For the evening dancing, we were able to set the disco lighting to our colour scheme, which worked really well with candles and foliage (latter 2 provided by our florist).
 
The food:
The buffet dinner was fantastic.  Pyra gave us multiple menu items to choose from and we were able to fix a nice menu that took into account guests’ dietary restrictions.  We initially booked the venue when it had a different chef and menu.  We came in a few months before our wedding to try the new menu – our dinner was delicious then and there was no dip in quality for the buffet-style served at our reception. Fionn worked with us how to plan best - because we wanted a relaxed style with a dance floor upstairs, we ended up feeding our 80 guests in two sittings downstairs, which worked perfectly. The upstairs space can seat 60 people, which didn’t work for how we planned our event, but does look really nice in photos. The late night food served around 10pm also went down very well.
 
The staff:
The staff, including the bartenders and waiters, were hardworking, friendly and very nice to guests.  Enough staff were around that guests never had to wait long for drinks.  Members of staff cut our cake for us and also boxed up the late night food for guests to bring home.  Fionn, the day-of coordinator, was on-site for our entire reception and was very helpful, even helping coordinate our midnight bus arrival.
 
Responsiveness:
Overall we were happy with the responsiveness of the venue.  It took a little while to nail down the final details of the food menu and drinks menu/bar tab but we were ultimately very happy with the result.  As the venue hosts more weddings/ larger-scale events we’d expect this will improve.

Overall:
We highly recommend Pyra for a wedding reception. We had 80 guests in total, which worked very well for the canapes/cocktail hour upstairs (4-6pm), sit-down buffet downstairs (6-8pm, split into two seatings) and dancing upstairs (8pm-midnight).  The upstairs loft was able to fit all 80 guests plus a four-piece band.  Lonsdale Road is also a charming street that provided great photo opportunities.  We looked into several other venues, and came away happy with Pyra's quote – we were able to book the venue, food (including canapes, dinner and late night food) and a generous bar tab for roughly the amount some other London venues were charging for just their space (no food or drink included). We and our guests had a fantastic time. Thanks so much to Fionn and the Pyra team :)"
V7,PYRÁ,"We had our wedding celebration at Lula. We booked the loft and restaurant for this.

Positives:
The venue is beautiful and needs minimal decoration.
The food was amazing; the chef is truly professional and everyone loved it.
They redecorated the restaurant section and added a set of couches to make it a lounge, which was beautiful.
The staff was very hardworking, professional, and lovely.

They provided us with a lounge, a wedding breakfast space and a dance floor.

Flexibility with Cake:
The bakery was scheduled to deliver and set up the cake at 16:45, but they delivered it at 09:45 instead. The Lula team handled the situation professionally by storing the cake and setting it up at the correct time. They presented the cake beautifully and assisted in cutting it into nice pieces. It could not have been more perfect.


The list of available drinks was huge, and they were happy to make custom drinks and bring in different juices if requested in advance. The event manager tried to accommodate every wish we had, and on the day we could not have hoped for more. Most of our guests said it was one of the best weddings and most beautiful venues they had ever been to.

Negatives:
Food tasting for the wedding menu was not included, which we had assumed would be, but it was given at a 50% discount. We had to sort out the floral decoration last minute, as they had initially suggested they would arrange it for us after providing a budget, but later said we needed to find our own. At times, they were a bit slow to respond, which made us anxious, but after communicating with them, this was resolved, and communication was very swift.

In conclusion:
Lula gave us the most beautiful wedding we could have dreamt of. We highly recommend them. The venue, the food, the service were amazing, and we could not have hoped for more."
V8,Sandon Manor,"We had such a special wedding at Sandon Manor, the team made every effort to make our day so so special and we will be forever grateful for that. A dream team! The day ran so smoothly and they worked so hard. The venue is unique with lots of different spaces which unfold throughout the day, which was perfect as our wedding fell on a wet and windy autumnal day. We would highly recommend Sandon Manor!"
V8,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor provided the perfect venue for our wedding. From the initial conversations and meetings with the team, we knew we were in safe hands and had made the right choice. They kept us informed with any events, made information a bit payments clear and reassured us with any query we had.
The accommodation was exceptional and fitted our requirements perfectly, with high quality finishing touches throughout to ensure our stay was as comfortable as possible.
The wedding venue was incredible! Our ceremony took place in the gorgeously modern barn with stunning draping and greenery. Following on, we had a blissful drinks reception which was on the expertly manicured lawn (with mini golf!) and sun-trap of a courtyard. We then moved onto our wedding breakfast which was held in the main barn, seating all of our guests comfortably with space for decor and extra details. Following from dinner, the part started and the club room came to life! This was absolutely the talking point of the day and our guests raved about how incredible it was! It managed to create a club-like atmosphere, whilst maintaining the vibe, albeit at a reduced volume, in the rest of the barn. The layout of the venue was important to us, as it ensured our guests never strayed too far, to keep the momentum of the day.
The team at Sandon worked superbly with all of vendors which ensured the day ran smoothly from set up to clearing. All of our vendors commented on how much they too loved working there.
The venue, the aesthetics, the staff, everything was perfect! We would absolutely recommend to anyone getting married."
V8,Sandon Manor,"We cannot recommend Sandon Manor enough. From the quality of the service, the helpfulness and friendliness of the team, the beautiful accommodation and the most amazing venue which all or guests loved partying the night away in. To make it even more special the Manor is in amazing grounds in beautiful countryside and nature reserves.
Sandon Manor made our dream come true."
V8,Sandon Manor,"I couldn't recommend Sandon Manor highly enough - from our first enquiry to our Wedding, nothing was too much trouble. The team are so friendly and easy to communicate with, very approachable and responsive. They respond to any questions immediately and having the day before to set up with Tom was fantastic. Styaying in the Manor House and Dovecote was the icing on the cake as to be with friends and family the night before and the day after was so fabulous. On the day Tom and the team were absolutely fantastic and couldn't have done more to make our special day. We couldn't have dreamt of anywhere more perfect than Sandon Manor - a huge thank you to all the staff."
V8,Sandon Manor,"If you are considering Sandon Manor for your wedding venue, I beg you: scratch it off your list now. Yes, the house and grounds are beautiful, but the people behind it are absolutely awful. They ruined our wedding experience.

I will get straight to it. Sandon Manor has a very strict policy on guests leaving the site by 11:30pm (and no one is allowed back to the Manor unless they’re official guests staying overnight). We had lots of international guests at our wedding. Many hadn’t seen each other in years and would be jetlagged - we thought they may be keen to continue chatting after 11:30pm. With this in mind, we made a booking with Sandon Village Hall via our contacts at the church (where we were attending services and later married). They granted us access to the village hall until 1am as a contingency spill over space.

We mentioned this in passing during our online meeting with one of the Sandon Manor team a month before our wedding. Within hours, I received a voicemail from the lady in charge of Village Hall bookings saying (quote) “someone at Sandon Manor is trying to throw a spanner into the works for you”. It soon transpired that they had raised an official complaint to the parish council and pressurised the village hall team into cancelling our booking. To be clear, Sandon village Hall and Sandon Manor are entirely separate entities – there is no crossover between them whatsoever, as the owner of Sandon Manor later acknowledged.

It gets worse. Gob smacked, we asked Kate – the owner of Sandon Manor – for a call to find out what was going on. She was abhorrent, trying to justify her meddling as a necessary measure to protect her wedding license (side note: with Sandon Manor it is always about the money – once your deposit is paid they care nothing for your ‘special day’; you are just another cash cow). Did she apologise for stabbing us, her clients, in the back? No, she did not. She could not even fathom how hurt we were by being completely bypassed in the communication chain and how deceitful and disrespectful this was. My husband and I were quite literally left speechless. We’ve never experienced this sort of treatment from anyone, let alone our wedding venue - to whom we were paying many thousands of pounds. Dealing with this stress in the final month of wedding prep really took its toll on us and soured things. We no longer looked forward to our day, rather dreaded what Sandon Manor might do next.

Aside from this major incident, there were many other occasions when Sandon Manor were unhelpful and unfeeling in their interactions with us:

- We enquired if it would be possible to arrange a large pizza takeaway order instead of using Sandon Manor’s caterer for our late night food. One of the team explained on a call that this wasn’t contractually possible; we acknowledged this. We then received an email saying ‘If you are unable to follow this or any other of our T&C's we would be happy to cancel your booking.’ This was less than a month before our wedding.
- We had a harpist perform in the church. We were told she wasn’t allowed to play during our drinks reception in the grounds due to potential noise complaints (an acoustic harp at 2pm in the afternoon). No other music was permitted outside the house.
- Sandon Manor is an incredibly expensive (in hindsight, grossly overpriced) venue. But we were also hit with hidden fees when booking their accommodation option - an extra £425 ‘cleaning fee’ was added to our bill.
- At the time of booking, Sandon was running a promotion waivering the £700 fee for hiring their ceremony space. As we were marrying at the church, we asked if it would please be possible to put this towards other elements of our day i.e. using their festoon string of lights in the barn (for which they charge £450). They refused.
- We were unsure about booking the 1-bed Dovecote on the grounds as - at £499 for the weekend - it was a considerable expense. While we were deciding Sandon Manor rented it out on Air BnB (to one of our guests, which made for a very awkward conversation).

To summarise, you only get one wedding day. Kate and her team absolutely ruined ours. There are so many other lovely venues in north Hertfordshire run by decent, humane people. Please prioritise your happiness and choose wisely. I wish we had."
V8,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor is a stunning wedding venue with a great team behind it. The exclusive use of the manor for the weekend was a highlight, allowing us to relax with friends and family in the lead up to and after the big day. The Sandon team were brilliant, guiding us through the planning process and ensuring everything ran smoothly on the day. We couldn't have asked for a better place and team to help us celebrate our big day."
V8,Sandon Manor,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our special day. Holly, Tom and the rest of the brilliant team made us feel welcome from day one. Special mention to Tom for making the day run so seamlessly, so professional and accommodating of all our needs.

The venue itself is stunning, located in the beautiful Hertfordshire countryside. The Manor House makes for a tremendous location to prepare, and the Dovecote suite is a nice touch: a great addition for the groom to spend the last night. We loved the small details of the characteristic main venue, with the botanical feel to the bar a great backdrop to the barn.

It’s a shame we can’t stay every week!

Dan & Suzanne"
V8,Sandon Manor,"To Holly, Louise, Tom & Kate, wow, what can we say but the biggest thank you for the best day of our lives! When we viewed the beautiful venue over two years ago we just knew instantly Sandon Manor was the one, not just because it’s stunning, but you guys are amazing! Thank you for making all our wedding dreams come true. Forever grateful and can’t wait to return to reminisce. Lots of love, the new Mr & Mrs Jakes xxx"
V8,Sandon Manor,"From the moment we visited Sandon Manor we knew this would be our wedding venue for 9 September 2023. Seeing the spectacular finish of the house carry through to the completed venue just shows the high level of attention to detail this venue had to offer.

Holly, Tom and the rest of the team filled us with confidence right from our first interactions, annd went above and beyond on the wedding weekend itself to facilitate us, our suppliers and guests. The main house, dovecote, annex and extensive grounds were a wonderful way to have close family stay with us on site, and so handy to be able to all get ready nearby the morning of.

Thank you for making our wedding weekend a truly memorable occasion, for us and our families. We all look back on this day with the happiest, sunniest memories and Sandon Manor will always have a very special place in our hearts."
V8,Sandon Manor,"We had the most amazing wedding weekend at Sandon Manor.

The venue itself is the perfect backdrop for a wedding, our photos looked amazing from every single angle. There were so many spaces to make use of throughout the day which helped things to run incredibly smoothly and meant we didn’t need to have a ‘turnaround’ during the evening. The spaces really wowed our guests and created such a lovely atmosphere. Including the ‘club room’ dance floor that had our guests dancing until the very last song!

We stayed at the Manor House for the weekend, extending our wedding into a perfect weekend retreat. The house itself is beautiful, with lots of different areas for everyone to relax, and the perfect peaceful location to chill the night before the big day!

From our first viewing to checking out the day after our wedding, the Sandon staff were attentive, friendly and helped us feel relaxed and looked after throughout an otherwise overwhelming process. We’d highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for a beautiful, peaceful and unique wedding venue!"
V9,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Thank you so much to the entire team for making our wedding so special! Thanks to Donique, MJ, Mo, Harry and everyone else for helping us organise our day and for their professional but friendly attitude. Merchant Taylors is such a beautiful venue and offers a brilliant layout and different spaces to make the day so special!"
V9,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you all so very much for such an amazing wedding on Saturday. You all worked tirelessly to make it so special. Everything was truly wonderful and you all did me proud! Both Hugh and I couldn’t have asked for anything more in terms of being so well looked after. Our guests were so impressed and have given us so many compliments on a brilliantly well run event. Thank you all again for playing a brilliant part in our truly wonderful day of which we loved every minute
V9,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you so much for the most wonderful wedding reception at the end of April. We had the perfect day and our guests all commented on how well looked after they has been. Thank you again for all your hard work!
V9,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"We know this is very late (we have no excuse), but we wanted to say thank you for everything you and the team at Merchant Taylor's did for us on our wedding day. All the guests have since told us how much they loved the venue, food and service. Fingers crossed you get a few couples getting in touch! Again, Thank You for everything!"
V9,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"My brother and I attended the wedding today, as Florist's for the wedding party.
We were treated fantastically well by ALL the staff that we met, nothing was too much trouble and they made our task a COMPLETE pleasure.
If this is how they treat the actual wedding party then you will have a unforgettable time. Many thanks to all the staff for helping us to do our job with ease ."
V9,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Zara,

Can we thank you and your team at Merchant Taylor’s Hall for all your hard work in making Caroline and Neil’s recent wedding so very special. You, in particular, were able to deal with every question and request in a really professional manner.

Merchant Taylors’ Hall is part of the rich panoply of history and tradition, which makes this great City. All of our guests, and in particular those from abroad, were totally spell bound by the atmosphere, the food and service.

James was superb in organising the whole operation. To turn the Great Hall from a wedding ceremony hall to a banqueting suite for 110 guests, including flowers, place settings and dance floor in ninety minutes was truly remarkable.

The food and wine was of an amazing standard, we know that Merchant Taylors’ Hall has a reputation for presenting some of the finest dining in the City of London. You certainly surpassed all expectations.

We have many wonderful memories of the 10th September 2016, but it is best summed up by our daughter Caroline, “Can we do it all over again?”."
V10,Garden Museum,I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate everything that you did to make our party such a success last Friday. It was brilliant being outside on such a lovely everning. Everyone was very impressed with the venue.
V10,Garden Museum,"Thank you for all your help, advice and on-the-day support, it really made our wedding very special and it certianly went off without a hitch! The Museum looked amazing and the garden was perfect, especially as the sunshine adn the guests wanted to make the most of the beautiful surroundings."
V11,Clearwell Castle,"Can’t tell you how wonderful the team were at Clearwell. Our wedding coordinator Phaedra was exceptional. Attention to detail and everyone of the team from front of house, waiting staff, groundsmen and the DJ made our day absolutely everything we dreamed of and unique to us.

Can’t recommend highly enough and cost was outstanding value for money.

So many our guest commented on the quality of the food and that it was the best wedding they had been too! The children loved the magic of the castle and opportunity to get outside and see the grounds.

The grooms family had a fabulous time staying in the cottages the night before and our guests at both the Castle & the Wyndham had a fabulous stay on the night of the wedding.

Wish we could do it all again!"
V11,Clearwell Castle,We had our wedding at Clearwell in June and we couldn’t recommend it highly enough. From start to finish everything was perfect and they went above and beyond to ensure we had an amazing day. I’d not hesitate in recommending them to any couples. Just a gorgeous place with staff that really care in making your day all that you hope it will be.
V11,Clearwell Castle,"From the moment we first visited Clearwell, we knew this was the venue for us. From the moment we started planning to the final touches on the day, all the staff were fantastic. Ann, our wedding coordinator, was a delight to work with throughout. Nothing was too much trouble and she kept us updated throughout. The day was tailored exactly to our needs and when we arrived at the venue on the day they had prepared everything perfectly.

We did the night before package which included rooms and food the evening before. We were supplied with so much food no one went hungry. The rooms in the Wyndham and the Castle are fantastically appointed.

The venue itself is gorgeous. The cellar bar downstairs adds a whole different dimension to the occasion where you can really let your hair down.

This was an absolute dream come true venue for us. We loved every single minute."
V11,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot fault this venue at all. We initially had to change our wedding date because of lockdown and they were so supportive and empathetic.
Ann, our coordinator, is quite possibly the loveliest person on the planet. She was always happy to answer any questions and it never felt like we were being a nuisances or asking a silly question.
On the morning of the wedding she was a lovely calm presence and the whole day just ran like clockwork.
The food was out of this world with many guests saying it was the best food they’d had at a wedding and one person actually thought we’d hired a Michellin Chef!
The venue is so so beautiful with plenty of space. The downstairs cellar was a great place to party the night away, it was like an exclusive nightclub. There were lots of quieter rooms for people who wanted some peace.
The DJ was brilliant, we forgot to give a list of songs we liked but he did a great job of guessing what we liked ( he must’ve looked at our age and figured nineties dance music was our era. And he was bang on the money)
I do not have a single complaint about this venue"
V11,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot speak highly enough about Clearwell Castle as a wedding venue. The venue itself is absolutely stunning. It rained on our wedding day but the indoor space was so vast and beautiful that ourselves and our guests still had the most amazing time! Our wedding co-ordinator, Phaedra, was absolutely incredible, both before and during the wedding. She was always so professional, replied to all of my emails (there were many) and answered all queries efficiently. On the day, we genuinely could not have managed without her. The day flowed so well with her guidance and it really helped me as the Bride as I felt I didn't need to worry about anything! All the other staff at Clearwell and at the Wyndham hotel were also so wonderful! Everyone worked so hard and every member of staff was so kind to us; it just made our day incredibly special and we are so appreciative to them all. The food was great, service very quick and all the guests really enjoyed it! We had so many compliments about the staff and venue! I honestly could not recommend Clearwell castle more as a wedding venue!"
V11,Clearwell Castle,"Our wedding on 10/11/23 was just the absolute perfect day from start to finish. Our wedding planner manager, Hannah, was incredible, not just on the day but throughout the whole planning process. She ensured everything ran smoothly on the day, sparing no details ensuring everything was just perfect and to time but without being stressful. She was very accommodating with the planning meetings working around both mine and my now Husband's shift patterns.
We both stayed the night before our wedding and the night of the wedding with many of our guests travelling a distance so also staying in the Wyndham which was very convenient. Staying in Keepers cottage with the Bridesmaids the night before added to the experience with the added feature of the hot tub, the groomsmen were very jealous. The beds were very comfortable and everyone was excited to stay in a castle.
On the day of the wedding, the staff were very accommodating moving the bridal party along to the bridal suite to finish preparations earlier than originally planned. The breakfast provided was the perfect amount for a busy morning getting ready. Everything, including the gardens, were immaculately kept adding to the WOW factor of getting married in a Castle.
The canapes served and welcome drinks were well received by the guests and ourselves whilst we had photographers prior to the wedding breakfast. The food was phenomenal and great portions and I was stuffed after. The staff were very accommodating for us with a lot of people with allergies, dislikes of mushrooms so adapting the menu for these individual people. We were even able to swap out a few bottles of wine included in our package for cocktails as us as the Bride and Groom did not drink wine.
As soon as we walked in the venue the first time, we knew it was the place we wanted to get married. Everytime we went back to view the venue again I fell more and more in love. For anyone thinking about viewing or even booking this incredible venue I would say do it! We will be going back for events in the future to relive the best day of our lives."
V11,Clearwell Castle,"We got married at Clearwell castle April 2023. What can I say it's the most perfect venue and we had the most amazing day. The organisation was amazing and the staff were great on the day and even leading up to the big day. Phaedra was our wedding planner and communication with her was great throughout and on our wedding day she ensured that it all ran smoothly. I cannot recommend Clearwell castle and their staff enough. Thank you again for helping us have our dream wedding.
Kind regards

Vanessa & David x"
V11,Clearwell Castle,"We had the most amazing wedding day on the 24th of November 2023, the whole day ran so smoothly and all our guests absolutely loved the venue. The food was amazing and our guests loved the fish and chip buffet in the evening! The whole progress of planning the wedding was so straight forward and Phedera was a great wedding manager."
V11,Clearwell Castle,"Clearwell Castle exceeded all our expectations for our wedding day. The moment we stepped onto the grounds, we were captivated by its timeless charm. The staff, especially Hannah, went above and beyond to make every detail perfect, ensuring a seamless and stress-free experience. The Ball Room, where we exchanged our vows, felt like something out of a storybook. The surrounding gardens provided a stunning backdrop for photos and added to the overall enchantment of the day. Our guests were equally impressed, and many commented on the unique and romantic atmosphere. Choosing Clearwell Castle was the best decision we made for our special day; it truly felt like a fairy-tale come to life."
V11,Clearwell Castle,"We had the perfect wedding at Clearwell Castle, their team were superb in providing planning assistance from the point of our booking, guidance on all aspects of our wedding choices from registrars and suppliers, and coordination on the day of the wedding to make sure it flowed seamlessly. It was a beautiful day, and we couldn't be happier with our choice of Wedding location."
V12,Inner Temple,We got married here in 2023. Everything was perfect and the team made sure the day/food etc was just as we wanted it. Particular thanks to Priya and Eva (Pegasus) for their hard work making our wedding day and lead up so special.
V13,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"I got married at Dodford Manor in February this year. A great time was had by all and I will be recommending the venue to any friends planning weddings.

The weather was bad on the day so we didn’t get to use the outside area very much, but it didn’t matter as the inside is so lovely.

Sky was really helpful and put me at ease on the day. Questions in the lead up and on the day were answered quickly and I was made to feel like the only bride in the world!"
V13,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford was the first venue we looked at shortly after we got engaged. The staff were friendly and relaxed when we had a tour, I knew it was the place for us! I think Lydia telling my now husband that we couldn’t have fireworks due to the animals nearby but we could have a fire performer outside, sold the deal for us! I got an amazing fire performer as a surprise for my husband and the guests after we had sparklers, and it just completed an amazing day!
We heard such positive things Dodford about how professional and smooth running weddings have been from our suppliers, and you guys didn’t disappoint. You handled the day so well, we didn’t worry about a thing and just enjoyed ourselves the whole day.
We honestly had so many lovely messages and conversations after our wedding about how the venue was amazing, everything and everyone was catered for, from my 88 year old Nan, to young children who could play and enjoy the outdoors with a scoop of amazing ice cream. We honestly couldn’t have asked for a better day, we would do it again in a heartbeat if we could! Thank you for making the day so seamless! We are eternally grateful to everyone at Dodford for making our dreams come true becoming Mr and Mrs Price!"
V13,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford Manor what an incredible venue, from initial enquiry to booking, Dodford and the staff were so accommodating and well organised. Nothing was ever too much trouble, even if emails were being sent at 11pm. The day itself, wow it was absolutely incredible, as our wedding was on a budget and due to small numbers Dodford were amazing at setting out our decorations, everything was absolutely perfect and a special shout out to Kayleigh who was amazing on our wedding day. She kept us on time, always checking we were okay and just such a lovely person and really made our day perfect. Would highly recommend a Dodford to any couple due to be married they make the planning and the day an absolute dream and we want to relive it over again."
V13,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"It goes without saying that Dodford is a fab venue.... stunning set up, well maintained, clean, perfect grounds etc... but the best thing about Dodford is the team! I had super high expectations of any wedding venue I booked as I used to run a wedding venue myself (potential nightmare client 😂).... from the 1st viewing the team were fantastic. Relaxed, stress free, organised, professional, knowledgeable, flexible but mostly importantly friendly which gave me complete confidence in them delivering my perfect day.
In the run up to the big day the team are super responsive on email and phone We didn't meet our Event Manager, Lydia, until the day but I was always confident that they work as a whole team and therefore having 1 point of contact was not necessary at all.
In the day Lydia was amazing! Still relaxed and professional and the whole day ran so smoothly. Every requirement was perfect, on time, delivered exceptionally.
We had the best day, thank you to the whole team (especially Lydia!)

V13,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We honestly can’t say thank you enough for how amazing Dodford Manor Barn was, along with all the incredible staff who helped make our day truly unforgettable.

From the moment we visited, we fell in love with the beautiful landscapes, open-plan barns, and stunning large windows that flooded the space with natural light. The venue package was one of the best we saw during our search—it felt like everything we could possibly need was covered.

The team at Dodford Manor Barn were incredibly friendly and supportive throughout the entire planning process. Communication was open and consistent, which made everything feel so much more manageable and stress-free. We were even able to find all of our wonderful vendors through Dodford Manor Barn, which was a huge bonus!

As a bride who suffers from anxiety, I was unwell on the morning of the wedding. But I have to give special thanks to Kayleigh and our vendors, who were absolutely amazing and supported me through every step—they helped me feel calm, cared for, and ready to enjoy the day.

Our guests couldn’t stop talking about how stunning the venue was and how lovely the food turned out. We were also lucky enough to have sunshine all day, topped off with a beautiful sunset in the evening—it truly felt magical.

Thank you again, Dodford Manor Barn, for being such a perfect place to start our next chapter.

With love,
Carter & Emmie (24.03.2025) x"
V13,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"From the moment we booked our wedding at Dodford Manor, we knew we were in good hands—but nothing could have prepared us for just how extraordinary the experience would be. Every single detail was handled with such precision, care, and genuine warmth that it truly felt like a dream come to life.

The venue itself is breathtaking, but what made our day unforgettable was the impeccable service. The entire team operated like a well-oiled machine, making sure everything ran smoothly while keeping the atmosphere joyful and stress-free. Their attention to detail was second to none—no request was too big or too small.

We want to give a heartfelt, special shoutout to *Lydia*, our incredible Wedding Manager. From our first meeting to the final dance, she was nothing short of amazing. Lydia went above and beyond at every turn—anticipating needs before we even voiced them, coordinating flawlessly with suppliers, and offering support with a calming confidence that put us completely at ease, (apart from making me cry the second I saw her! 😂). Her passion for what she does shone through in every interaction, and our day would not have been the same without her.

Thanks to this amazing venue and its phenomenal team (especially Lydia!), we were able to truly enjoy every moment of our wedding, knowing everything was in the best possible hands. If you're considering this venue for your big day—don’t hesitate. It’s everything you hope for, and more.

We want to do it over and over!
A day we will NEVER forget!!

Thank you again and all our Love,
Mr & Mr Pargeter-Prince
Rowan & Karl xx"
V13,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We booked Dodford Manor in Feb 2024 after we viewed the space, for our wedding in March 2025. It was the only venue we viewed, but instantly fell in love with the character and variety of spaces the venue had to offer. The free corkage also really appealed to us as a great way for us to bring our own drinks at a good cost.

From start to end, the team were amazing, helping us with the planning of the day and making sure we had a great array of suppliers we could work with. The live band was a huge part of our day, and Dodford have a great mixture of acts on their supplier list.

On the day of the wedding, the groomsmen arrived at the venue to help with set up to see that our amazing event manager, Kayleigh had every single aspect of the day in hand and sorted. She sorted all table settings, decor, stationary - Everything!! Nothing was too much to ask of her and the Dodford team. The day ran impeccably well, with everything being on time and everything we asked for being sorted. Our drinks were served chilled, on time and were always around. It’s easy for venues who offer free corkage to try and limit you drinking your own drink - Not here!! There was constantly beers being topped up, wine bottles replaced and aperol spritz being taken round. Cannot fault them!

The team packed all of our bits away and ready for us to collect the next morning. We are very aware Dodford is a busy venue and wanted to make sure we wasn’t just “another wedding” but at no point was that the case. We felt like we were the one and only wedding and genuinely could not ask for more!

Thank you so so much for everything, Highly recommended!!"
V13,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We got married her a month ago today and had the most amazing day with them. Jess, Jack and the team made sure that everything ran smoothly and that they were doing everything they could for us on the day. We would 100% recommend them for anyone wishing to marry in such a beautiful setting."
V13,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We had been apprehensive booking Dodford for our reception that it was so popular in Northamptonshire that our wedding could end up looking the same as a lot of others we knew of, as we're local - but that was a ridiculous thing to worry about! The level of flexibility/customisation you get with Dodford is unmatched in our opinion; as it's such a beautiful venue to start with, you don't have to work hard to make it look good before adding in your personality as a couple!

The whole process from enquiries to final planning and the execution on the day were great. We did have a slight issue with them not inviting us to a food tasting in enough time before our wedding date (whether they forgot/we were missed off a list we don't know) but when we did raise it they invited us to a tasting at their sister venue instead (it's 2 hours away but we were available to travel thankfully). Every member of staff we encountered in our experience with Dodford were so friendly and make you feel like you are the only couple that matters for them in that moment, which we really appreciated from such a popular/busy venue. Abbie was our Event Manager on the day and provided such an elevated level of service, nothing was too much trouble and she executed our plans/vision to a tee, adding in some extra details that we loved too.

Our wedding was in December 2024, and we only had our reception at Dodford, so the ceremony barn was set up for our drinks reception with plenty of space for guests without it feeling cramped or equally like we were all rattling around in there (we had 75 guests for our reception). They don't have many photos of indoor drinks receptions in their promo so I was a little worried how it would look but the team had it set up beautifully. We also had a brass band on the mezzanine level which was really fun and festive!

What sold Dodford for us was the no daytime corkage, which meant we could really personalise our drinks reception and wedding breakfast drinks without breaking the bank. There was a slight disconnect with how and when we had requested/planned to serve some of the drinks in our planning meeting and what happened on the day, which we think may have been a slight hiccup in communication between Dodford and Jenkinsons (the caterers), but it didn't have a negative impact on our day at all!

Overall, there's a reason this is such a popular venue - it is truly perfect!"
V13,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,Dodford manor is an amazing wedding venue. From the very beginning when we first stepped into the venue to look around we fell in love. We knew we had to have our wedding there. After booking the venue we had amazing contact with the staff from booking our food tasting session. To a general email to see how our wedding planning was going. The planning meeting was well organised and we were able to talk through exactly what we wanted and no want was too big for the team.
V14,Gosfield Hall,"I never imagined my wedding would be somewhere as stunning as Gosfield hall but from the minute we saw this venue we knew it was the one for us and didn't bother viewing anymore venues as we had already made our minds up about having our wedding here! We were absolutely blown away with the natural beauty of Gosfield hall and so booked two years in advance of our wedding day! The professionalism and advice we received from Linda was super helpful and informative on the run up to our wedding as there is soo much to think about! We loved that we could have our day and evening all in one place aswell as the option weather permitting to have our wedding ceremony outside. I'm pleased to say the weather was absolutely perfect on our wedding day and we got to have our fairytale wedding outside! The package we paid for was well worth the money! Our guests were absolutely spoilt on our day and have all said it was the best wedding they've ever been too! It was amazing to have our guests stay over aswell! Jocie our wedding planner was absolutely amazing! She was sooo friendly and super accommodating and went above and beyond on our day to make it absolutely perfect with no hiccups! She even helped dress me on the day as she knew how to do up a corset dress and my mother didn't have a clue lol she made all my wedding details and decorations come to life and done such a stunning job decorating our dream venue aswell as being super supportive towards me my family and guests! The honeymoon suite is the best we've ever seen and completely took ours and our guests breaths away! Mind blowing! The food,venue,grounds,accomodation and night before accomodation were absolutely stunning and we want to thank everyone at Gosfield hall for making our day soo incredible and special and a day we and our guests will never forget! We can't wait to return to Gosfield! Thank you everyone at Gosfield what an amazing place!"
V14,Gosfield Hall,"We had previously experienced Gosfield Hall as a guest before deciding on it for our anniversary.

Our day was beautiful and went according to plan. Our guests all had great feedback about the day.

The only thing we would have changed would have been more diverse menu for the main meals."
V14,Gosfield Hall,"Gosfield hall is a beautiful location for a wedding and their packages cover all the important stuff! We didn’t have to worry about caterers, wedding coordinator or a DJ - all included! Great service, lovely food and everyone really enjoyed the day! Our coordinator Jocie was fab on the day, getting everything organised and fetching anything we needed. Couldn’t have asked for better, she knew the time line and the day flowed really smoothly!"
V14,Gosfield Hall,"We got married at Gosfield Hall and everything about it was perfect from when we arrive to view it, booking, the communication and Faye Carter our wedding Coordinator! If you want the best wedding day with no hassle, Gosfield is your place!!"
V14,Gosfield Hall,"Myself and my Wife have just got married at Gosfield Hall,
Our expensive started when we viewed the venue and we first met Linda sales manager, she welcome us in & made us feel at home, we wasn’t sure how, but she made us feel calm like this was where we was meant to be.
Once we looked around at all the venue has to offer we had already made a decision as this is such a stunning location and instantly new this was what we wanted! It was just right for us.

We did not get made to feel pressured to make any decisions immediately however we did end up booking our big say within the next few days after our visit.

Our next contact was with Ellie our wedding planner, she was very helpful and nothing was ever to much, we enjoyed the food tasting at the venue and was very impressed with the experience, it was out of this world.
Ellie helped us through all of our problems and made sure all of our plans come to life.

Now on our big day, what can I say? The staff were amazing, Ellie couldn’t have done enough every time you wanted to ask a question she was next to us any time we needed something. She was there all the way through the day/ night & even the next morning, Ellie made our day Run seamlessly.
We’ve been to many weddings before but never have we had food as amazing as we did here.
Every guest was amazed at the food quality and commented on how delicious it was!
Just to sum up if you’re thinking about booking your wedding at Gosfield Hall don’t question it just book it. You will be amazed."
V14,Gosfield Hall,"The venue is stunning and was the perfect setting for our winter wedding (so much natural light even in January). Jocie Golbourn was our assigned wedding planning specialist and she is so kind, sweet, patient and professional. All our guests loved the venue but many actually commented on how flawless and seamless the day was organised and rooms decorated and prepared from each section of the wedding and we only have Jocie and venue staff to thank for their meticulous planning and preparations. The food and drinks were delicious. Couldn’t recommend this venue enough- we actually booked the venue on a whim and were SO happy when we visited for an open day. There’s no false advertisements- it’s stunning."
V14,Gosfield Hall,"Everything, from start to finish, was exactly what we wanted and more. The preparation was helped by our wonderful personal manager, Tara, and accommodated each and every one of our requests and needs. The venue is gorgeous, food delicious, and atmosphere felt special. Our friends and family all told us that this was such a spectacular wedding for them that it was the best they've ever been to. We felt completely taken care of, kept us calm and happy throughout the day, and kept all of our suppliers in place and to standard. It felt glamourous and unique. We wish we could relive the day over and over. It really was our dream wedding."
V14,Gosfield Hall,"We got married in Gosfield Hall in May and had the most amazing wedding day that any couple could ask for. The whole experience from the arrival the night before to leaving the day after was seamlessly managed by the team at the venue.
The house and the grounds looked absolutely stunning and Ellie and the team did a brilliant job at keeping the day running smoothly without making anyone feel rushed. Everyone there was immensely friendly and helpful and we really felt that everyone who worked there was invested in making our day feel special.
We fell in love with the venue when we booked it but the whole experience exceeded out expectations so much that we wish we could do it all again!"
V14,Gosfield Hall,"I wanted to take a moment to commend and state our appreciation for Jocie. She truly was phenomenal, approachable and no task was too big.
We had 5 months to plan our wedding and we loved every moment. With us both working in the service industry it was great to have someone who was so switched on and would be an asset to have on any team."
V14,Gosfield Hall,"Having just got married at Gosfield Hall I can honestly say it was the most beautiful venue and the most perfect day. The staff were so attentive and professional. The food was outstanding and the drinks and cocktails were fabulous. They couldn’t do enough to make sure our day was everything we’d dreamt of. I have to say a special thanks to Ellie - one of the wedding coordinators on site - she went above and beyond to help us plan our day and was there from the very moment I woke up delivering fresh pastries for breakfast to the moment she made me a cup of tea to go to bed with. I can’t thank you enough Ellie, you are an absolute credit to Gosfield Hall."
V15,Kingston Estate Totnes,"When I first enquired with Kingston I thought it would be too expensive but we explained what are budget was and when we wanted to get married and they put a quote together that was affordable.
We have just had the most amazing one day wedding which didn't finish until the early hours. We got married in the Long Barn where there are chandeliers running down the middle, it was very romantic. There is this nightclub at Kingston which is very cool which everyone loved. The guests all said the venue was stunning and the food was out of this world.
A few of us stayed the night before and most of our guests stayed the night of the wedding in the cottages and barns. The staff were brilliant and they coordinated the whole day for us. I cant recommend the venue enough."
V15,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had a two day wedding at the Kingston Estate. All our guests were completely blown away by it.
Most of our friends and family had traveled far for the weekend and were not disappointed when then arrived as the cottages and barns are gorgeous. Some even have hot tubs.
Jodie and the Weddings Team organised a welcome party for the first night which was unreal along with providing street style food for everyone around 8.30 pm. At Kingston they have this really cool enormous Yurt and food hut which is used the day before the wedding and for breakfast.
On the wedding day itself we got married in the Walled Garden and there were endless canapes during the drinks reception. We then decided to eat in the Hayloft Barn which has glass windows overlooking all the gardens.
We used the clear span marquee for our reception party and had the craziest cover band before we all went into the nightclub until 3 am. The good thing about Kingston is everything is included they let you use things like cake stands, easels, knifes, speakers, microphones, all furniture at no extra cost, they set everything up for you and then clean up afterwards. We didn]t have to do anything which made everything totally stress free.

Thank you Jodie, Ellie and Charlotte it was insane !!"
V15,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had the most magical wedding at Kingston. From the moment we set foot onto the grounds, we knew it was the perfect place for our special day. It was our first viewing… and nothing else compared for us (we saw a total of 6 venues). What stood out to us the most was the variety of spaces available for each part of the day. The selection of ceremony areas, the beautiful outdoor spots for photos, the yurt for the night before party, and a special one for us… the underground nightclub for the evening! As party lovers, this was a part that sold it for us; there was somewhere for every moment.

One of the things we loved most was the flexibility to personalize every aspect of our wedding. The venue truly felt like a blank canvas that we could transform into our dream setting, but equally, we got away with doing absolutely nothing as it was beautiful all on its own.

But what truly made our experience unforgettable was the incredible staff, led by Jodie. They were not only professional and attentive but also genuinely warm and welcoming. Their support and attention to detail ensured that everything ran smoothly, allowing us to relax and fully enjoy our day.

We're hoping to return and stay in the future, for a special occasion.

It's not just a wedding venue; it's a place that holds a special spot in our hearts as the backdrop to the beginning of our happily ever after 🤍"
V15,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Kingston was perfect. Despite a rainy start, the day was amazing and Jodie was available but subtly in the background allowing the day to be ours."
V15,Kingston Estate Totnes,"After over a two and a half year wait due to Covid, our son and his wife had a wonderful wedding weekend. Jodie from Kingston Estate and her team of staff went above and beyond to ensure the wedding ran smoothly. Every detail was dealt with professionally. The accommodation, venue and food were all excellent and all our guests many from overseas had a wonderful time. The only thing Jodie could not oversee was the weather but even a little rain didn't spoil the celebrations."
V15,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue and staff were brilliant from start to finish. The venue is really multi-functional and caters for rain or shine. The weather was really unpredictable around the time of our wedding but I was a stress free bride knowing they had it in hand. The food supplier was stunning - we had a weekend package which all the guests raved about. That coupled with the unlimited drinks pages made it the perfect venue for us. A Devon treasure that feels like being on a film set - everyone loved it!
V15,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Such a beautiful venue - we loved it so much. The food was incredible and despite having a changeover of wedding planner close to the wedding day, it had no impact on our day what so ever. The venue are calm and professional and loved their approach to communication which was friendly."
V15,Kingston Estate Totnes,Fell in love with the venue on our first visit. We were particularly looking for a venue which could cater us for 3 days and sleep the majority of the the guests. The grounds were well kept especially the walled garden which is where the ceremony took place. The team were a pleasure and made the day truly special.
V15,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Our 3-day wedding celebrations were spent at the STUNNING Kingston Estate - a truly unique venue that we absolutely fell in love with. It had EVERYTHING we were looking for & more. The grounds are perfectly manicured all year round & come complete with walled garden. The cottages & main house are beautifully decorated, providing luxurious accommodation for 86 of our guests. Sarah & the team were such a pleasure to work with & couldn’t do enough for us. The catering was also top notch. Thank you"
V15,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue was great we had a few personal health issues beforehand but the team went above and beyond to make the day extra special. The wedding planner organised everything for us and they had plenty of props on site that we were free to use. We had the whole place to ourselves for the weekend it was brilliant and our friends loved the hot tub and pool.
V16,Holmewood Hall,"We were married at Holmewood Hall on 15th February 2025 and I can honestly say that it was the most magical day. We went to visit the venue and instantly fell in love with it but even we were blown away by how beautiful everything looked on the day. All of the staff were amazing - special shoutout to our personal wedding manager, Laura Pike, who was always on hand to answer any questions - she couldn’t do enough for us! The food was wonderful & we had full control over the menu. Would highly recommend this venue, you won’t regret it!"
V16,Holmewood Hall,"Holmewood Hall was an absolutely perfect wedding venue. The house is stunning, well cared for and beautifully decorated. All of the staff are so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Our Wedding Coordinator was fantastic, available from early morning of the wedding and was still there the morning after working for us. The food was excellent, drinks and canapes were amazing and the venue took care of everything for us. We had the most perfect wedding and are so pleased we chose Holmewood Hall. The Gold Room where we had our ceremony is gorgeous. Thank you for giving us a beautiful wedding!"
V16,Holmewood Hall,"I cannot fault this venue at all, the venue itself is breathtakingly beautiful with magnificent rooms and very lovingly maintained grounds. The staff are incredibly friendly, professional and efficient, our wedding coordinator Lee was a pleasure to work with and made our special day run smoothly. If you want a hassle free wedding with breathtaking grounds and the most amazing staff then this is the venue for you."
V16,Holmewood Hall,"Had the most amazing wedding here recently and cannot recommend it enough.

The venue itself is stunning and the options included in the luxe package covered everything we could've possibly wanted and made planning the wedding 100x less stressful.

The staff were all amazing from start to finish, Katie showed us around initially and then Lee was our personal wedding manager, and they were both incredible throughout. Always on hand to answer any questions and help us through the day once we got there.
We had so many comments from our guests on how lovely the staff were on the day!

A particular highlight though was the food - the tasting evening was a dream and the chef went above and beyond to provide a full vegan menu for us which wasn't limited to only a couple of options.
Again, we had so many non-vegan guests complimenting the food and saying how lovely it was!

Overall, an incredible day and an incredible venue.
Thank you so much to everyone there!"
V16,Holmewood Hall,"This place is simply just amazing 🤩
We had our wedding here on 17-12-24 and it was everything we dreamed of and more. The food, staff, decor were just perfect not forgetting the most beautiful Christmas tree 😍
Our person wedding planner Lee was an absolute god send not just having him there on the day but always being at the end of a phone to answer any questions or worry’s.
If we could go back and do it all again we would and not change a single thing.
The most perfect day at the most perfect venue ♥️"
V16,Holmewood Hall,Perfect venue for a wedding with guest numbers 60 - 100. Our guests and I moved from each room to a new room throughout the day and every room had a new surprise. The bridal suite was lush and it was great having all our guests staying under one roof. I would 100% recommend this to anyone.
V16,Holmewood Hall,"The wedding day and lead up to the day were fab. However, for the price we paid, we expected a little bit more.
I opted to use the bridal cottage the evening before for which we paid £450 extra. This is something I now regret, as there was no hot water and we were not able to order any food in as all the take away options were shut (on a Friday night). The hot tub also needed a good clean. So the night before/morning of my wedding was not ideal. I flagged this to the manager who advised that we should have raised the cold water issue as soon as possible, but seeing as we were trying to have morning showers on the wedding day, this did not leave us any time.
Our package included pre-drinks, wine with dinner and we also purchased a cocktail ""cart"" (cocktails on a table) and a bucket of beers. The groom, who is not a wine fan, asked for a beer with his wedding meal and was presented with a contactless card machine to pay for it at the top table. We felt this was a bit unnecessary as there was a full bucket of extra beers outside and it felt a little embarrassing having a card machine presented to us at the top table on our wedding day for one measly Corona, despite the huge amount we had paid. Also, guests were unknowingly allowed to buy beers from the bar after the meal, despite there being available beers to them already in a bucket next to the bar...
Overall the wedding was lovely, but for the price we paid we expected a bit better. Essentially, I loved the venue, but I wish we had not purchased any extras!"
V16,Holmewood Hall,"We got married at Holmewood Hall on 4th October 2024. From the first moment we stepped into the venue and I saw the magnificent Gold room I knew this would be the perfect place for us to get married. We had the most amazing day which was perfectly coordinated by the whole team at Holmewood but especially so by our personal wedding manager Lee. Lee was always quick to respond to any questions we had in the lead up to the day and nothing was too much trouble for him.
We honestly wish we could do it all over again as it was a magical day. We would recommend Holmewood Hall to anyone looking for the perfect venue."
V16,Holmewood Hall,"After getting engaged in late March this year we wanted to get married fairly quickly so booked Holmewood for the same September. The venue, grounds, accomodation were all stunning and we felt very fortunate it was within budget and the package we got was outstanding in comparison to other venues and what it included, which was far far more than other venues. We got to attend a luxe event to choose all our wedding food, canapés, cocktails and wines which should have made things easier but due to the unbelievable quality it made it harder! Our wedding planner Lee is literally the most fantastic person. He was flexible, fun, engaged and on absolutely everything. The day was ran impeccably and also smooth even with some weather concerns and speeches taking a bit longe than we thought. If you book here ask for Lee!! We had the most perfect day. Can’t fault a single things. Our guests all told us how incredible everything was with one even saying he will now longer not attend any further weddings unless it’s at Holmewood. Thank you to all the staff and as mentioned a huge special thank you to Lee! Your a legend!"
V16,Holmewood Hall,"Exceptional venue, stunning grounds, fantastic DJ, and excellent service. Highly recommended! Happiest day of my life 😊"
V17,Bourton Hall,"We got married at Bourton Hall on 08 March 2025 and our wedding planner was Harminder. The day was absolutely amazing from start to finish. All the food and drinks were of a high standard and presented beautifully which includes the wedding breakfast, canapés and cocktails, and breakfast the next day. The venue is gorgeous with lots of rooms, well maintained grounds and exclusive use. The staff are friendly and accommodating and the event was really well managed. We would like to particularly thank Harminder, who was supportive throughout the wedding planning process and the wedding day, ensuring things ran smoothly and in a timely manner. He is a great communicator, provided advice and guidance where needed and attention to detail. We really had a magical day! Thank you so much! We would happily do it all over again and would definitely recommend this venue!"
V17,Bourton Hall,"What a fabulous wedding venue! Because it's a wedding venue and not a hotel that holds the occasional wedding, they really focused on what was important and anticipated our every need. It's an elegant venue but with a comfortable feel to it. The team are incredibly accommodating and helpful and each couple is allocated their own personal wedding manager to guide them through the process and to make sure every detail is covered.
There's a beautiful chapel on site where non-religious ceremonies can be held - this was fabulous.
The food was plentiful and delicious - all our guests raved about it. Great choice of welcome drinks and canapes, wines and cocktails.
The grounds are gorgeous; a perfect backdrop for our October wedding.
The venue was exclusively ours and has beautiful bedrooms, including a huge, stunning bridal suite. Most of our guests stayed overnight and took advantage of the brilliant breakfast in the morning so it really extended the celebration."
V17,Bourton Hall,"Our wedding at Bourton Hall was better than we ever imagined. The Italianate mansion is truly spectacular inside and out however it is the team that made our day run perfectly. Our guests found the setting and the food incredible, they were very impressed! Our wedding planner Emily Sarjant was fantastic her knowledge and expertise made our day magical from start to finish, with all the special touches that she suggested. Our first dance was created in such a beautiful way it will be a memory we cherish forever. Thank you to Emily and the team at Bourton Hall. My husband would also like to note that the croquembouche was amazing and everyone should have one."
V17,Bourton Hall,"My wife and I got married at Bourton Hall in September, with our wedding managed by the wonderful Eleni. Everything about the day went as perfectly as we could've wished, right from arrival to departure the following day. The venue is stunning, and the food was lovely, and having 21 bedrooms on site was such a bonus so that all of our close friends and family could stay on site with us.
Bourton Hall did everything they could both in the run up to the day and on the day itself to alleviate all stress to ensure everything ran as seamlessly as possible, which it absolutely did.
We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall enough."
V17,Bourton Hall,"We were married on 28th July 2024. What an amazing day we had at Bourton Hall. Could not fault it! The venue is so elegant! The grounds and views were to die for. The food was out of this world with so many choices and all cooked and served to perfection. Accommodation / rooms were plentiful and luxurious. Lovely to have a chapel on site too. We had the whole place to ourselves, we felt like royalty! Lots of varied rooms and areas for people to choose where they wanted to be after the wedding breakfast. We would choose the venue all over again!"
V17,Bourton Hall,"We had both our wedding ceremony and reception at Bourton Hall and the service was superb throughout. The house and grounds are beautiful with amazing views to go with them. The staff were professional and helpful during the lead up to our wedding day and during the day as well - even when we had an emergency prior to the ceremony which caused delays, the venue staff were able to work around this to move timings back in order to allow all of our planned activities to go ahead and be fully enjoyed. All the food was delicious and we had a wonderful wedding day thanks to Bourton Hall."
V17,Bourton Hall,"We had the most perfect wedding day at Bourton Hall. Throughout the planning process and on the day, the team were so professional, which meant we could relax and know that everything was in their capable hands - Emily was an amazing wedding manager. The building is beautiful inside and out, and the grounds are stunning - there are so many places for beautiful photos, and views out over the countryside. The food was absolutely delicious, it was so hard to choose what to have! It was also so helpful to have so many places for guests to sit and chat in the evening, away from the disco room but still part of the action. Having so many bedrooms onsite (not to mention a stunning bridal suite!) was an added bonus. We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall highly enough, and have had so many comments from guests saying what a beautiful, elegant but relaxed day it was, so I know they really appreciated everything Bourton has to offer too. Thank you so much to Emily and the whole team for giving us such a perfect day!"
V17,Bourton Hall,"As the Bride and Groom we were made to feel like nothing was too much to ask and they couldn't do enough to make us feel special.
All the guests commented that it was one of the prettiest and most relaxed weddings they have been to.
We could not have asked for a better wedding day thanks to Bourton!"
V17,Bourton Hall,"I had my wedding on 10/02/2024 I am so happy I chose this venue, It is really magical. My wedding manager was just the best! Emily went above and beyond to help me on my big day! I cannot thank her enough.

One of the main things about this venue is that t has its own chappel which is really special and makes you wedding seem more traditional, however there are more options/ rooms available. I wanted the wow factor and I got it.

Some of the options that made it great

*Onsite accommodation for night before and night of the wedding is really helpful
*Exclusive use
*Dedicated wedding manager definate gamechanger! (Emily)
*Menu choices are fantastic.

Everyone commented on the food being really nice ( we had the lamb) The evening buffet was also great. I paid extra to have a meal created as having part of my culture within the food at the wedding was very important to me, they did not disappoint.
Emily was perfect in so many ways, she knew exactly my vision once i explained it to her and she made sure that it became real for me. She adapted parts of the day so that it would work better, for example bringing the canapes outside whilst photos where being taken. Helping me into my dress, looking after my phone just everything I needed she was there. She really worked hard to make sure it run perfectly and it did.

Thank you emily!!! You made my day Great."
V17,Bourton Hall,We got married at Bourton Hall on 30th July 2023. It was the most amazing day ever! We are still receiving compliments from our guests on how stunning the venue was and the whole running of the day. This was 100% down to our wedding co-ordinator Harminder. He went above and beyond to ensure our day was absolutely perfect. He literally could not have done any more! Thank you again Harminder!!
V18,B&H Buildings,Bourne & Hollingsworth was such an exceptional venue for our wedding this September. This is the perfect place for you if you want a true London wedding that feels like a fun dinner/house party but on an epic scale. We used the top floor (the studios) for our sit down dinner (think candle light and tasty roast lamb) and headed downstairs for our reception with the basement club (below and hidden) for late night dancing. The place is stunning (greenery and glass everywhere and the cocktails are insane but what really makes this place are the people. The whole staff from Matt and Lizzie to the bar team to the dinner crew made our whole day seamless and so fun. Could not recommend B&H more highly for your London wedding.
V18,B&H Buildings,"Beautiful wedding celebration in the most stylish venue - we had an intimate wedding reception (drinks, dinner and more drinks!) at the Bourne & Hollingsworth Buildings. The staff members on duty were excellent - nothing was too much trouble and they served everyone with such professionalism. We couldn’t recommend it highly enough and we haven’t stopped talking about it since. All of our guests were so impressed with the space and how stylish it was. The bar, restaurant and greenhouse are all aesthetically beautiful and the botanical vibes make for a very relaxed, but premium setting. Special shout out to Lizzie who helped us coordinate everything and Matt on the day who led the team. Thank you so much - we had the best day and we couldn’t have wished to host it in a better venue."
V18,B&H Buildings,"India & the B&H team were seamless. Flexible, responsive, kind, and easy to deal with. They made our day so special. The food was fantastic, the drinks were lovely, and the value for money was first rate!"
V19,Leez Priory,"I never in my life thought I would get married in a place like Leez priory! The whole experience from start to finish was just fantastic. The price breakdown was manageable and there was no pressure to take any upgrades offered. The things we got in our package were phenomenal and having a wedding planner was tremendous - our lady (Leanne) was an absolute god send!
They catered to all our needs and we were made to feel so comfortable and nothing was a problem! I’d highly suggest going to an event there before hand, just to get a feel of what it’s like full of people and enjoy their delicious food. We actually enjoyed their entertainer ( singer) so much we hired him for our wedding ☺️
Lee priory is just so beautiful. I can’t speak highly enough x"
V19,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory on the 7th of September 2024. Considering how long they have been a wedding venue, they were pretty flexible with some of the ideas we had for the venue styling that turned out amazingly!

The staff really made the day something special and couldn't have done enough for us. Special mention must be made for Leanne, our wedding planner, who was amazing!

Highly recommend the venue and the incredible team that helped to make our day so special!"
V19,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in October 2024. This venue is stunning both inside and out with immaculately kept grounds and interior. The hospitality in the lead up to and on the day of the wedding was fantastic. The food was also brilliant. Another great perk of this venue is the amount of on site accommodation.

A couple of drawbacks / experiences during our wedding. There are only a few toilets in the main building which kept blocking and overflowing throughout the evening which led to us taking some guests to the dressing room or honeymoon cottage to use the facilities. You are also restricted by the venue on any external food or drink suppliers and the venues optional extras for this are quite expensive for what they are.

That asaide, we had the best day and evening at Leez Priory and would certainly recommend it!"
V19,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in August 2024- great venue and experience from initial viewing to leaving the morning after the wedding. Leanne acted as our wedding planner and was friendly, professional and helpful throughout. We opted for the classic package and the food was amazing quality with everyone commenting how full they were!
The venue is beautiful with several options for ceremony both inside and out. Accommodation was great too. The whole day ran smoothly with perfect weather - we will have very happy memories of our day!"
V19,Leez Priory,"Perfect venue and very attentive staff, lovely food and great communication from start to finish"
V19,Leez Priory,"Stunning venue. Fantastic Team. Very accommodating toward our unique ""surprise"" strategy. Our guests were truly surprised. Thank you."
V19,Leez Priory,"Leez priory was the 1st and only venue we looked around when we started planning our wedding. From the moment we stepped on the premises, everything just looked so perfect and exactly what we wanted from a wedding venue. When we got assigned our wedding co-ordinator Rachel, she was just absolutely spot on with everything we asked for and nothing was too big an ask for her. She made sure the day ran as smoothly as possible and took care of any issue that arose without me knowing (which I am forever grateful for!!)
The rest of the staff were amazing and very helpful.

The venue itself is just absolutely stunning and we loved that it has the pub area as well as the dance floor so it catered to all of our guests.

All of the rooms were lovely and it was so nice being able to stay in the fisherman’s lodge onsite the night before the wedding.

We genuinely cannot recommend this venue enough and it was 100% worth the money! 10/10!"
V19,Leez Priory,"We got married on a Tuesday in October to maximise the value of what we could get for our money; and honestly, we got everything we wanted and more. Leanne, our Wedding Manager was perfect at bringing an attention to detail and seamless organisation to the big day, and in the lead up. There wasn't one moment of the day where we felt stressed, as Leanne had it covered. In one particular instance, our flowers for the bridal party's hair hadn't arrived. Within five minutes of telling Leanne that we needed this, the flowers were with our hair and make-up suppliers to add the finishing touches.

Leez Priory as a venue is the most stunning setting, and offers an incredible range of areas in which the ceremony and reception can take place. There is also the opportunity for the bridal party to make use of the Fisherman's Cottage the night before the wedding, and for people to stay in the on-site accommodation on the evening of the wedding, making it the perfect venue for people also travelling from further afield.

Leez Priory were very accommodating, welcoming and were happy to work with us to make our day as perfect as possible. The food was incredible, and a total hit with all of our guests, and so many people have commented on how incredible the day was as a whole. You wouldn't be disappointed to choose Leez Priory."
V19,Leez Priory,They catered to our every need. To when we would ask for things they hadn’t been done before they still made sure it went smoothly. Leanne was amazing she made me feel so comfortable from the start. The whole day was stunning. Beautiful venue please go view it as you will not be disappointed
V19,Leez Priory,We got married on the 26 May 2024. This venue was absolutely brilliant! They catered for every need and made sure there was no stress on the day. Leanne was kind and level headed throughout and was always one step ahead! Do not hesitate to book- do it now!
V20,London Rowing Club,"We picked this place because we wanted somewhere fairly central and casual. We fell in love with the long room and the view. Our wedding was in October so we thought we'd have it cosy but we ended up with a beautiful autumnal day so everyone was on the balcony. The fairy lights were perfect and the other rooms were great to avoid leaving. The staff was so friendly and accommodating that we would definitely recommend the venue.

The only thing that could have tainted the day is that after three visits and many emails, we were never told that the river floods (a lot). We were flexible with our day so if we knew this we would have built it into our day, instead, I was told by the photographer on the day as I got out of the taxi that we wouldn't be able to take any group photos because the area would be flooded during the cocktail hour and half that we had assigned as photo time. This would have been disappointing but we all ended up running outside after the ceremony to take photos before the tide came in. My husband and I borrowed wellies for our couple photos. We had fun doing this, but I can imagine many couples being upset! My friend's electric car also flooded and they were obviously upset."
V20,London Rowing Club,"Annabel was meticulous in her help planning the wedding. Very knowledgeable and helpful.
On the day the rest of the staff were brilliant - there wasn’t an empty glass in the house.
Great venue at a reasonable price on the London riverside."
V20,London Rowing Club,"LRC was the perfect place to celebrate our wedding this summer. The venue staff went above and beyond to ensure that everything went as planned both before and during the event. Thanks in particular to Annabel who was responsive, helpful and always put us at ease in the build up. The location is stunning - couldn’t have asked for a better day!"
V20,London Rowing Club,"We just wanted to say an enormous thank you for everything. From the moment we came to visit the LRC on a slightly grey January weekend, we knew it would be a fabulous venue for our June wedding reception and it certainly did not disappoint. It really is the most beautiful setting and we have very fond memories of our guests enjoying drinks in the sunshine with the most fantastic view over the Thames. The venue has such character and lends itself beautifully to a wedding reception. We have received so many compliments from our guests and I would encourage anyone thinking about booking their wedding at the LRC to do it, you will not regret it! We were lucky to be blessed with beautiful weather so were able to have our jazz musicians play on the balcony for the drinks reception before moving into the Long Room for our meal. It looked stunning with the tables dressed and mantles adorned with flowers. Following the meal and speeches, guests enjoyed drinks back on the balcony and in the Fairburn and Members Rooms which provide plenty of seating, whilst the Long Room was cleared and the band set up. We then partied the night away.

From start to finish, the organisation was so straight forward. Annabel was very accommodating and full of helpful advice in the run up. I knew that on the day she would ensure things ran like clock work, which of course they did. Our suppliers also commented on how helpful the LRC team were to work with. On the day the staff were brilliant and went out of their way to ensure everything ran smoothly (including borrowing some large gym fans from the rowers to put in the Long Room to keep us cool as it was an unexpectedly hot day). We really can’t thank you enough and now need to think of an excuse to host another party with you in the future!"
V20,London Rowing Club,"We got married in St. Mary's church and then had our reception in the London Rowing Club in February 2023. It far exceeded our expectations and was an incredible fabulous stress-free day with thanks to the wonderful Annabel making the day just run.

In the lead up to the event, Annabel was incredibly responsive, helpful and helped us plan the day exactly how we wanted it. She answered all our questions really quickly, always got back to us, was very flexible with what we could do and allowing us to personalise the space. Prior to the event, Annabel arranged for us to go and have a look around on a couple of additional occasions to help us plan how we would want it to look. She also gave our caterers a tour of the kitchens as they were new to the venue.

In the immediate lead up to the day, Annabel helped with our suppliers in getting chairs delivered and bringing all the wine over a day earlier. On the day, she helped to make the day flow and just dealt with things throughout the day.

The venue itself is beautiful with three rooms to use. A middle reception room, a cosy snug and the main long room. In the main long room, there is a rowing boat hanging upside down with fairly lights. The main lighting can be dimmed and gave a wonderful atmosphere for the evening meal. As our wedding was a winter wedding, it was fairly chilly so they lit fires in the main room and snug which added to the atmosphere.

We had around 90 guests - could have fitted a few more just about. We used the round tables, tablecloths, linen, plates cutlery and glasses provided and they were perfect for a wedding and looked very smart. No need to hire these. As mentioned, we did hire separate wedding chairs instead of the conference chairs provided. There's a lot of decoration in the way of rowing memorabilia on the walls which means you don't have to actually do too much to make it interesting for guests.

Overall, the perfect London wedding venue with absolutely fabulous views across the Thames with a long balcony to enjoy from. To top it off Annabel is truly amazing and so helpful."
V20,London Rowing Club,"We had our wedding (ceremony+reception) at LRC in July, and the venue itself and the team we worked with were absolutely incredible! Everything on the day went without a hitch and we heard so many compliments on the location - our guests loved the balcony and the layout inside, which included plenty of space for anyone wanting a break from dancing to sit down and relax. Would recommend to anyone looking to host an event!"
V20,London Rowing Club,"London Rowing Club is a truly fantastic venue and we were both so delighted with how our day went! The venue has real character with the classic rowing memorabilia and it’s location on the Thames, and looks amazing when it’s all set up. The layout and size of rooms I thought were perfect for our wedding of about 70 (+15ish more in the evenings) and of course the big attraction is the balcony which all of our guests adored!! (I wish I’d had more time during the day to stand out there and enjoy it 😂). Not only is it a fantastic venue in a great location but what really made this the most amazing venue was how great all of the staff, and all the recommend suppliers were! The day exceeded expectations and we got compliments on the place and the staff from all our guests. Couldn’t be happier with the venue, it was perfect for us!!"
V20,London Rowing Club,"We found the London Rowing Club while desperately combing through London locations after our original venue fell through a few months before the day.
Luckily for us it was available due to a cancellation - kismet!
From the start the charming Annabel put us very much at ease and helped us to envisage the day as we hoped it would be. She was very flexible and helpful throughout the planning process.
We were incredibly lucky with the weather on the day and the venue really came into its own - it was virtually impossible to get guests off the terrace, which is the perfect size for our smallish event (65 people) and of course offers gorgeous river views.
We were well looked after by the team and everything went off without a hitch. The interior of the space itself is lovely with a great sense of history.
Nice additional touch - table tennis was made available in the entry room for the later part of the evening!

It's a special place and I'd thoroughly recommend for anyone seeking a memorable spot to tie the knot!"
V20,London Rowing Club,"We got married at the London Rowing Club on a brilliantly sunny winter day on Saturday. All the way through in the run up (after 2 years or more of postponements), Annabel and team bent over backwards to help us arrange everything, recommended some brilliant suppliers for food (Shona Pollock comes highly recommended) and flowers (same with Steph the charityflorist.)

So many of our guests said how lovely the venue and staff were on the day, and the whole place looked a million dollars with an amazing photo set on and around the balcony and river - although we haven't seen those yet. The corkage and bar tariff prices are also incredibly reasonable for an inner London location!

I can't recommend the LRC highly enough. It will live in memory for a very long time."
V20,London Rowing Club,"The London Rowing Club team alongside the Dinner Ladies went above and beyond to ensure that we had the wedding perfectly fitting our requirements. Throughout the entire all of the suppliers worked seamlessly together to ensure the space transformed as we progressively added guests and transitioned between eating, our ceremony, more eating, music and dancing. We wouldn’t have had it any other way. The attention to detail of the team is second to none - perfect for any bride and groom seeking a beautiful event."
V21,The Prince Albert,"The team at The Prince Albert were always accommodating, made everything easy and stress-free, and helped us organise an amazing wedding party. They really knew what they were doing, and helped guide us through the process calmly, working around our schedule (which wasn't easy - we live abroad!) to make sure all our last-minute worries and concerns were sorted smoothly. The food was excellent, and the space was fantastic for our party. Can't recommend it highly enough!"
V21,The Prince Albert,"We had such a happy wedding with Harrison and this venue. Harrison was really flexible and answered any questions we had and made great suggestions when we needed seating arrangements, the schedule for the day, a florist, and more. The day was accessible to everyone and the food and drink were perfect. Thank you for making out wedding stress free and wonderful."
V21,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert was the most wonderful venue for our London wedding. We came across the venue at there wedding fair and chose alot of our suppliers from the same wedding fair.

Harrison and Lauren were always so on hand to help with any questions and did a fantastic job answering all of our questions. The staff were so friendly and helpful and made everything run like clockwork.

We couldn’t recommend The Prince Albert enough for a london wedding and would love to do it all again."
V21,The Prince Albert,"My wife and I were beyond happy with how everything went on our wedding day. Harrison, Diana, Claudio and the whole team were absolutely phenomenal! It was such a beautifully efficient operation, and we always felt like someone was there to help us when needed.

We've had dozens of compliments about the great food and how wonderfully intimate the venue was for a wedding. Some of our more traditional relatives said they were initially sceptical at the prospect of a pub wedding, but that it was one of the most beautiful and joyful weddings they’d been to. A friend of mine was also very happy that someone at the bar remembered her drink order throughout the evening! On top of that, everything ran perfectly to schedule, which is no doubt down to the high attention to detail.

It was very useful that the upstairs was free on Friday afternoon so that we could set up the space. It gave us plenty of time to do the flower arrangements, put up the bunting, and stick photos on the frame wall.

Thank you again so much for all the help and support you've given us - it really was the best day of our lives (so far)!"
V21,The Prince Albert,"My husband and I got married here in late September 2023, and I cannot recommend the Prince Albert enough!! Booking a wedding venue can be stressful and we felt like a lot of the venues we looked at gave us the ""hard sell"" but the folks at the Prince Albert helped to put us at ease every step of the way. We fell in love with how beautiful the pub was, so hired the upstairs for the ceremony, wedding breakfast and party afterwards for around 40 - 45 people. We were able to drop off decorations the night before and talk it all through with the staff, and they did such a good job of working with us and the florist to get the place looking amazing. The ceremony went off without a hitch, everybody loved the food and we had a blast in the evening. All the staff were amazing, but special shout out to Harrison and Lauren for helping us plan and run the day, and Maria for managing everything on the ground both when we dropped off the decorations and during the wedding itself. Thank you again for helping us celebrate our special day with our loved ones, for making it so stress free and so memorable!"
V21,The Prince Albert,"All you ever hear about wedding venues is that everything is a rip off, the food is meh, and there are a ton of annoying restrictions...the opposite is true of Harrison and The Prince Albert team. From Day 1, Harrison made the whole process not only easy but really fun! He was quick to respond, super knowledgeable, and very accommodating; he even helped our best man execute a surprise for us without it disrupting any timings. On the day, they decorated the place beautifully, managed to serve a 3 course dinner to 76 people unbelievably fast, and everyone raved about the food - to say they did a good job is a gross understatement, they went above and beyond. We were after ""classy fun"" and that's exactly what we got - thank you so so much!"
V21,The Prince Albert,"We had the exact wedding reception we wanted at the Prince Albert thanks to Harrison, Claudio and the other amazing staff who helped us feel so relaxed in the build up and during. We wanted a very low-key vibe and the team understood that but there were enough options for any style of wedding you wanted. The upstairs function room felt cozy and intimate while still leaving breathing room and space to dance, but you could easily rent the whole place if you wanted more guests and even choose to do your ceremony there. We had the most compliments on our food (we chose a buffet option). The team were particularly accomodating to some complicated dietary requirements and it was all delicious."
V21,The Prince Albert,"July 6, 2023 was the most memorable day of our lives! A big thank you to Harrison and the rest of the team for assisting us through out the whole process. Our guests loved the Prince Albert pub especially the sumptuous food and booze on our wedding day!

David & Dannah"
V21,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert is a Great venue for the classic Pub Wedding.
Harrison and the team did an amazing job to organize everything. The food was great and the service first class. Only sorry it was over so quickly. Thanks again for everything."
V21,The Prince Albert,"We found The Prince Albert when our original venue cancelled on us less than 2 months before our wedding. & we are so glad we did; everything happens for a reason! From the moment we met Harrison, we knew we were in safe hands, and the team at the Prince Albert made our day amazing. The pub looked beautiful and we were very greatful for the effort the team put in putting up all our decorations. We had so many compliments about the food, and we were very impressed in the swift and organised manner in whichever it was served. Everyone had a wonderful time, and we would not hesitate in recommending The Prince Albert."
V22,Kindred,"We chose Kindred for our 60 person wedding and it could not have been better. We wanted a venue where we could have the ceremony, dinner and dancing all under one roof, that was wheelchair accessible, and easy to get to on the tube, Kindred ticks all those boxes and more!
The food is incredible, we really enjoyed popping by to do all the tastings, we'll continue to come to the Cellar for food and cocktails. Many guests commented on how good the food was.
The place itself is gorgeous, inside and out. We used the whole venue, the main Hall for the ceremony, dinner and dancing, and the Library upstairs for the drinks reception and cake cutting. Also, being right next to Hammersmith station, the venue could not be easier to get to!
The staff are wonderfully attentive and helpful, both before and on the day. They were really open to the little details that made our day uniquely ours, from the drinks selections, to having a table and glasses on stage for the ceremony, to playing our music selections at the right time. Plus its a dog friendly venue!"
V22,Kindred,"We LOVE this venue! We got married here with only 12 weeks notice and Anna, the owner, and her staff went above and beyond to make the day as memorable, magical, and marvellous as we'd hoped it would be. The venue is elegant, stylish and perfect for a London, city based wedding. The food is sensational as it comes from their in-house kitchen on the ground floor and every guest remarked on how delicious their meal was. It's restaurant quality food, not your standard wedding food. The place looks stunning in all our wedding photos and the wedding cake they made us (at very short notice I might add!) was second to none. Everyone loved it. The venue was also perfect for late night dancing and drinking and merriment. It was such a pleasure - and a breeze - to work with Anna and her team on one of the most important days of my life, and I very much hope to do so again in the future. I will forever be grateful to her and all she helped us with."
V22,Kindred,"We had our wedding reception for 35 guests at Kindred, in the Library and Salon earlier this year. The day went incredibly smoothly, the staff couldn't have been more attentive and our guests raved about the food for weeks afterwards. It was the perfect sized space for our intimate celebration, really cosy and the atmosphere was great. The little touches really helped to make the day special, with espresso martinis served for the speeches and sparklers for our exit at the end of the night. Thanks again to the lovely Kindred team!"
V22,Kindred,"I cannot find a single fault in our experience with Kindred for our wedding. Not only was it a stunning venue that honestly made some of our guests gasp as they arrived, but Anna and the team were so incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. Having them support us really took so much of the wedding planning stress away and we knew we were in safe hands. I really appreciated that the team were happy to chat through ideas with me and were always keen to find creative solutions to give us the day that we had envisioned.

The food was absolutely delicious and they were so accommodating for our long list of dietary requirements from our guest. The cocktails were also so delicious. Our guests were buzzing for weeks after, as were we.

On the night, the staff were not only incredibly helpful and efficient, but also just so friendly, welcoming and complimentary. We felt thoroughly spoilt and very well looked after.

We visited so many venues and this was by far the best choice for us. The interiors made for some stunning photos and the layout of the spacing meant that whilst we had 80-100 guests, it still felt very intimate. I cannot recommend Kindred enough!"
V22,Kindred,"We would give a thousand stars if we could. Kindred hosted us for our cocktail style wedding and it was everything we could have hoped for and the perfect venue for this style of wedding. The wine, cocktails and food (incredible grazing board, canapés, bowls and pizzas) were exceptional and the team were on top of everything, friendly and nothing was ever an issue. We would HIGHLY recommend it. We have had loads of guests message us to tell us what a spectacular venue it was with the most friendly team. The venue had different spaces to suit our needs and the AV is amazing - it worked perfectly for our live music band and our DJ, and our own music playlists for our ceremony. They took the stress off planning and really did mean we could relax and not worry that everything would run smoothly. Thank you so much Kindred team for giving us the best day of our lives"
V23,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The best day of our lives and me and my now husband couldn't be more thankful to Bredenbury. Before booking Bredenbury we visited over 17 wedding venues in Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Herefordshire - we fell in love instantly, there is no need for a crazy amount of extra expense on decorations, the venue speaks for itself. The fact that it was no corkage just added to why we wanted to book and the team were so friendly. In the lead up to the wedding they were brilliant, we booked far in advance and brought over all our family members to come see the venue, they were so flexible, understanding and welcoming - they couldn't do enough for us. On the wedding day they had decorated for us by the time we had arrived and all we had to do on the day was to enjoy it - which was perfect. It really was the best day of our lives, all the comments from our family and friends was how beautiful the venue was. They kept the day running so smooth and we didn't need to think about a thing."
V23,Bredenbury Court Barns,"There truly aren't words to describe how incredible Bredenbury Court Barns and their entire team of fantastic staff were through the planning process and the day itself. They were so friendly, supportive and nothing was ever too much. From quick replies to any questions that popped to mind to planning meetings that left us feeling prepared and ready to the day being set up beyond perfectly. Our amazing wedding coordinator Lianna spent the days and months (years really!) leading up to our big day making sure everyone detail was perfect, that everything was incorporated that we'd dreamed of and made sure we didn't feel a moment of stress from start to finish. All throughout the building from the bridal booth, to the orangery to the oak barn was beautifully light and open - even with our wedding being the end of October - and we had so many compliments about this! There aren't enough words to say thank you and explain just how much we'd recommend this venue to everyone"
V23,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We had the perfect day back in July. The weather didn't go to plan but they helped make the day so special even with the last minute switches because of the rain. We had such an amazing day and the feedback from our guests about the venue, food and service was great! We cannot thank the team enough for the effort they put in throughout the whole process but especially on the day. We felt incredibly supported throughout the whole process."
V23,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The venue itself is stunning. The buildings, grounds and interior decorations are all beautiful and immaculately presented. From the moment you turn down the lane it is so picturesque, you know you've found somewhere special. It's exactly what we were imagining for our wedding venue.

The layout is perfect, with ample space for guests to mingle and move about, and great accessibility for older and disabled guests. Ours was a winter wedding, and while most of the day was inside it wasn't cramped and we could still enjoy the beautiful grounds through the expansive windows that run along the whole barn.

All of the venue is stunning, but practicality-wise the Bridal Suite warrants a special mention. Room length mirrors, plenty of room for the bridal party to get ready, have their makeup and hair done, and if there's time to relax as well. Drinks were served from 11 onwards, and it has it's own toilets and shower.

From our first meeting at Bredenbury the staff were exceptional. They gave a reassuring air of professionalism and experience, with just the right level of excitedness for our day without it feeling forced. We were really impressed by how responsive the whole team were, with speedy replies to any questions we had during the planning. This is something we particularly appreciated as we only gave ourselves 7 weeks to plan our big day.

Value for money wise it felt tricky to gauge when we were trying to choose a venue as the headline figure is rarely what you'll end up paying, with different venues charging different amounts for different things. Not the case with Bredenbury. With their No Corkage policy and generosity in being able to use whatever props they already have, any extras were non-essentials of our own choosing.

No Corkage is pretty significant. Some venues wanted to charge £20/bottle, so not having to pay this and being able to supply not only our own wine but beers, gin and soft drinks for the drinks reception and wedding breakfast was not only a massive saving but also made the occasion more personal for us. The bar staff and catering team were excellent, pouring and serving drinks, warming our mulled wine and setting up the gin bar. Once your guests have drunk you dry the venue's bar is well stocked and standard pub pricing.

We wanted a Christmas wedding and seeing in early November that they had a date available that December we couldn't resist. 7 weeks isn't long to organise a wedding with nearly 100 guests, and we couldn't have done it without the Bredenbury team being so organised. Our assigned event manager, Harriet, was brilliant in the runup and on the day, as were all the other managers and staff we spoke with. The Wedding Bible they fill out with you is a great idea and nails down all the finer details to ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible on the day.

We didn't want to have to spend the day before and morning of our wedding worrying about set up and decorations, but needn't have worried as Bredenbury did all of this for us. A meeting beforehand clarified what we wanted where; we simply dropped off boxes of stuff the day before and rocked up in the morning to find everything laid out as hoped.

This organisation extended to the third party suppliers, of which Bredenbury have an extensive list of local recommendations. We booked the ceiling lights with Cotswold Wedding Co. and didn't have to do anything else. The band, Apollo Gold (incredible!!) set up without any hassle and didn't have any issues with Bredenbury's noise limiter. Our florist Katrina Bevis hadn't been there before, but again had no problem getting everything in place on the morning.

On-site accommodation was good for close family and friends, but there's not enough for the majority of guests and the lack of a dedicated honeymoon suite is a bit of a shame. If you want privacy for your first night as a married couple it means taking over an entire lodge. The quality and comfort of the rooms is excellent, though, and the continental breakfast served the morning after in the East Lodge was delicious, with ample options for Vegan and Gluten Free.

Jenkinsons are the exclusive caterer for Bredenbury and have an extensive menu for nibbles, the wedding breakfast and dinner. The menu and ordering process is clear, and pricing is what we expected to pay. Food and service was as slick and faff-free as everything else. A real delight.

On the day, Harriet and the catering manager were absolute superstars. Zero stress, everything ran to time and as planned, and they were always available if we had any questions or needed help.

The whole day was perfect and exactly what we wanted. I don't think we could have achieved this without the exceptional organisation of Harriet and the team. The entire process was very slick, zero stress, and we wouldn't hesitate in recommending Bredenbury Court Barns to anyone looking to get married in a countryside paradise."
V23,Bredenbury Court Barns,"I want to say a massive thank you to Bredenbury Court Barns for hosting our wedding. From the start they were super amazing and accommodating to us. They won us over with their care and support even when we had a pickle in the beginning.

Olivia was super helpful from the start and throughout the year we were planning she offered huge amount of support and suggestions.

We typed in “orangery weddings” in google when we were first looking because I was keen to get a ceremony in an orangery and Bredenbury popped up after much searching. Once we saw the Orangery we cancelled every other viewing we had across the country because we felt we found the perfect place, and nothing compared to the reception with the beautiful windows that brought all the light in. The grounds were absolutely spectacular and gorgeous. It was a no brainer for us to pick such a beautiful venue. They brought my ideas to life and we were able to get support on anything from recommendation of suppliers, to ideas on decor to their favourite meals from Jenkinson’s. They fully outdid themselves in love for us. We can’t forget it.

Our wedding day was exceptional with Lianna helping us all the way. She was a breath of fresh air. She cared about all the little details and made us feel relaxed and had a good laugh with us. The fact she was there 100% of the way, before the wedding, during the wedding, and even after is unmatched! Thank you Lianna for really being there to make our wedding day smooth and relaxing.

The food was incredible too and we often think about how sad it is that we didn’t finish our second plates, we think about it a lot.

Thank you for the wonderful journey BCB, you blew us away with your integrity, kindness, and genuine support!"
V23,Bredenbury Court Barns,thank you to everyone at bredenbury court barns who made our day so special
V23,Bredenbury Court Barns,"From the moment we stepped foot into Bredenbury Court Barns, we knew this was the venue for us. It was the first and only venue we viewed as we were blown away by how gorgeous the venue is. The venue itself is absolutely stunning, with breathtaking views and impeccably maintained grounds that set the perfect backdrop for our special day.

The staff went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. From our first consultation to the last dance, their professionalism and attention to detail were exceptional. Harriet was absolutely brilliant and I don’t know what we would have done without her!

The food was another highlight—our guests are still talking about how delicious everything was! Jenkinsons are amazing, they helped us personalise our menu perfectly!

We couldn’t have asked for a more beautiful venue to have our wedding. The day couldn’t have been more perfect! Thank you to everyone at Bredenbury Court Barns for making our wedding day nothing short of magical!"
V23,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We could not have had a more perfect experience with Bredenbury Court Barns. Right from initial booking all the way through to breakfast the following morning, everything was perfect. Nothing was too much trouble for our wonderful planner, Lianna. She ensured the day ran smoothly and our months of planning turned out exactly as we’d imagined. They are available to answer any questions you have any time, they’re only an email away and get back to you so fast. The venue itself if just gorgeous, the grounds make for some wonderful photos, and the orangery lets so much light in that your ceremony photos are gorgeous. The whole place is fully air conditioned too which was great for our July wedding. The bridal suite is a perfect balance of being aesthetically pleasing and practical for getting ready in, it’s so spacious, lots of natural light, there’s plenty of plug sockets and huge mirrors so everyone has plenty of room for getting ready and no one is on top of eachother. There’s even an outside space for getting some fresh air. I’m so glad we chose to have our wedding here, it’s given us memories to cherish forever and there are zero memories of any stress!! Cannot recommend this venue enough!"
V23,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We cannot believe how lucky we fell to get married at such a beautiful venue. Right from the offset of viewing the venue, to our special day, we were taken of. No question was too silly, and so much pressure was taken off us during the planning. We managed to make everything our own and Lianna was there every step of the way. Thank you for giving us our happily ever after. We will forever be grateful."
V23,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We loved our wedding at Bredenbury the team did an amazing job providing everything we asked for and more. We especially liked that our wedding coordinator for the day, Harriet had thought of everything for us she went above and beyond and even offered to go and get my mum some more shoes when hers broke! absolute 5-star service and the food was amazing too!"

V25,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow what can I say, Brinsop is an absolutely stunning wedding venue with heaps of character and so many options of places for the ceremony and to do things. We fell in love with it as soon as we saw it and knew it was where we wanted to get married.

Right from the start, the Brinsop team were so helpful and accommodating. From giving an virtual tour then showing us around in person, Issy and the team were fantastic right the way through. Nothing was a hassle, no request too difficult and they were incredibly professional and responsive throughout the whole process.

We loved that Brinsop is an exclusive venue with accommodation on site so we could stay with the bridal party and our immediate family. All the rooms are unique and have so much character and it's fun exploring the whole place. You feel like you are in the middle of nowhere, in nature with swans, ducks and birds all around.

Throughout our planning process, Issy and the team helped us every step of the way, being incredibly flexible in managing our requests and really trying to create our vision. They even got their team to make a giant jenga that we could use on the day! They helped to create the most perfect bespoke wedding breakfast and canapes menu, and seemed so positive and excited to be part of our special day and experience.

Arriving at the venue, Issy and the team were ready and had everything prepared and ready to go. It made the process so smooth for us and meant we could really enjoy the day without any stress. Issy coordinated perfectly with all of our vendors and it really felt like she and the whole team were so happy for us and wanted to be part of our day which was amazing. Our guests commented on how friendly and responsive all the staff were and it really made the experience extra special.

I wouldn't change anything about the day and it was perfect. I would absolutely recommend Brinsop as a wedding venue and all the staff who are really invested in helping deliver your vision. Thank you so so much to the whole team for making this a day that we will look back on for many years to come with amazing memories."
V25,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow, what a perfect day we had! It really went without a hitch and that was thanks to Nina and all the staff at Brinsop. The team worked seamlessly to ensure the day was as perfect as could be, and it really was! The wedding was booked over 2 years in advance and the staff were so accommodating with all my questions, planning and site visits, they couldn’t do more to support us. Special thanks to our coordinator Nina who was a delight to work with and a credit to Brinsop. Everyone that attended agreed at how beautiful the venue and grounds were, it was a wedding people won’t forget! 10/10 would recommend to anyone!"
V25,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"It's taken me quite a while to get round to writing this review, because sadly it's quite a bittersweet one.

We were married last year on 15 June and Brinsop was our chosen venue for both our ceremony and reception. We were first attracted to brinsop by the accomodation, meaning our loved ones could stay on-site, especially my grandparents which was so important to me.

The home itself is absolutely beautiful, including ivy cottage which myself and my mum stayed in the night before the big day. It really was a picture perfect setting, and looking down from the bridal suite seeing the ceremony space being set up on the Wordsworth lawn was honestly magical. Id dreamed of an outdoor wedding on that lawn, and we were so grateful the weather cleared so we could have it. The team really did wait till the latest they could to ask us to make a call on an inside or outside wedding (despite being June, it was a gloomy day to start) which I really appreciated!

Another amazing part of hiring brinsop was the after hours space we were able to enjoy until 2am with our house guests. The games room was absolute fantastic and meant that if you wanted to go to bed you could, but you could also stay up, party and play pool. I really do think this was a highlight for our guests and would recommend massively if you can spare some budget.

On the night of the wedding, myself and my new husband actually stayed in one glamping tents which we absolutely loved. The groundsman was on site until we were ready to leave the games room, and he then took us up to our tent in one of the buggies, making sure we had plenty of blankets and even stopping off for some bottles of water for us. This was really special, and can't thank him enough.

Hugo Spritz!! Having hugos at both our welcome drinks and drinks reception after the ceremony was amazing. I'm not a fan of prosecco myself and Mark and the team made it possible for us to have Hugo's all round. We even sneaked some up to the bridal suite to have before the ceremony (thanks Nadia!). Our guests loved them, and the amount of people that have told me they now need them at their own wedding is crazy!

Onto the not so good - sadly it all started to go a little downhill when we moved things into the knot barn for our wedding breakfast. Sitting on the top table, I could see that guests at the top of the second rows of long tables didn't really even have a seat around the table and were just kind of plonked on. The seating plan hadn't been followed, and I don't think there were even enough tables laid for the service to be comfortable for people because there was a dance floor at the end of the barn (which I did not ask for).

It was quickly also brought to my attention, that one of our guests had had to put her child on her lap in order to remove the high chair so people had more space. We also lost about 5 napkins with them setting on fire from the candles because everything was just way too cramped.

I asked to speak to catering, and asked if there was anything that they could do. I was told 'well sure, if you want the whole thing to be late'. In truth I shouldn't have even had to broach this myself, as it should have been sorted by the coordination team.

The tables weren't changed, even after they'd said they'd sort after the first course and yet the whole meal still ran late. We've had so much feedback about people not having enough food, food not being easy to access on the sharing platters etc and honestly when you've waited so long for a day and had spent 25k on the venue and food alone, it really has been heartbreaking to hear. I do sometimes question why people still bring it up (even now, people talk about the dining) when it clearly upset me so much.

Whilst writing this review my husband asked my what we had for evening food - we didn't get any. It was left unannounced on a back table. I don't know what I was expecting, just not that.

The next morning, the houseguests were asked to come down to breakfast for 9am (it was on a note in the room) but as we were in the glamping area, we walked past the knot barn just before 8.30 and the food was already out. We ran down to the house to hurry everyone up, and by which time everyone arrived it had been sitting there for 20plus mins going cold.

My biggest upset was that when I fed all of the above back to brinsop, feeling pretty deflated about the catering, I was told they'd pass my feedback on and heard absolutely nothing back. 25k total with over 10k on food and drinks to hear absolutely nothing, and this was 9 months ago. I'm not saying this in would happen to anyone else, but really - it shouldn't have happened to us either."
V25,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our wedding! From start to finish, everything at Brinsop was flawless. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most magical backdrop for our special day. Our guests were blown away by the beautiful venue, the warm atmosphere, and the seamless coordination. Every detail was taken care of, and we felt so well looked after. The team was incredible, professional, friendly, and attentive. On the day itself, they ensured everything ran smoothly, allowing us to truly enjoy every moment. A special mention goes to our amazing wedding coordinator Nina!"
V25,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We had our wedding on New Year's Eve 2024 at Brinsop, and it was more perfect that we could have ever hoped for. The venue itself is stunning, with beautiful spacious rooms which slept over 40 of our guests. Our coordinator, Nina, was incredible and so supportive on the day - she kept everything running so smoothly and everything went by without a glitch. The food and drink managers Mark and Amy did the most incredible job - nothing was ever too much, they were so attentive, and the chefs the most stunning meal after we gave them a fairly vague brief of 'curry'! We had the most perfect day and we're so incredibly grateful to Brinsop and the team."
V25,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,Brinsop Court is pure magic—an unforgettable venue with an incredible team!
V25,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We were lucky enough to have our wedding at Brinsop Court in December, and it was an absolutely spectacular day. We fell in love with Brinsop as soon we set our eyes on the beautiful manor and surrounding gardens. Cate, Amy, Mark and the rest of the wonderful staff at Brinsop really go the extra mile to make you feel special, and are extremely flexible with requests in order to make your day feel more special. We honestly felt like there was no request too big leading up to the day and they really made us feel extremely comfortable leading up to the day.
On the day, Cate and her team were well on hand to help us with setting up everything and she had everything under control when there were a few hiccups. The day itself was absolutely magical, and that wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for everyone at Brinsop working extremely hard to ensure that everything went to plan and as smoothly as it could.
Thank you to everyone at Brinsop for making us feel at ease and ensuring that our wedding was an amazing day."
V25,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Brinsop, the perfect wedding venue! We got married at Brinsop in December and I can honestly say it was everything we could have hoped for and more. We found out about the venue through Hitched and was one of only two venues that we visited but as soon as we got the house we knew it was the one. We fell in love with everything about it and it was fair to say that our guests agreed with us with many saying it was the nicest venue they’d been to. We had the wonderful Nina as our coordinator and she was brilliant! Nothing was too much trouble and we had constant communication with her in the build up which helped our stress levels no end. The same can be said for all of the staff who were brilliant throughout and allowed us to have the best day of our lives with everything running seamlessly. A special mention must be given to Amy and the catering staff who put on such an incredible menu (including the tasting session that provided some of the best food we’d ever had) and ensured that the food has been one of the main things that people have mentioned to us since the wedding! We had our ceremony in the Banqueting Hall which provided the perfect setting, especially with it being a winter wedding, as it really added to the cosy atmosphere and the lounge areas/games room were perfect for the drink’s reception. We would have loved to have also had it in the courtyard, but the temperatures meant that the lounge with the fireplace was a far more appealing option on the day. We then had the wedding breakfast and reception in the knot barn which was decorated beautifully and was the perfect place for the party in the evening. Overall we really can’t thank everyone at Brinsop enough for making our day what it was, we can honestly say that we have been made to feel part of the family and already can’t wait to hopefully come back to stay in one of the cottages for our first anniversary!"
V25,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Where do I start!!
Brinop Court is the most stunning venue, it was the first venue we visited and instantly fell in love! Theres so much history to the house and we were treated like family every time we visited before the wedding and it literally felt like home the whole weekend of the wedding, my guests also agreed!!

A special thank you to Issy our coodinator who went above and beyond ti make sure everything was perfect for us. It was so easy to plan and nothing was too much to ask, even arranging our dog to be our ring bearer!! When they say Brinsop is dog friendly they really mean it!!!

What a place, what a day!! Thank you so much everyone, you all made our day perfect and it really was the best day of our lives♥️"
V25,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We got married at the gorgeous Brinsop in October this year. It’s hard to put into words how amazing the whole experience was. We honestly had the best day of our lives!!!

We fell in love with Brinsop during our first visit back in December 2022. We knew almost immediately that Brinsop was the venue we were looking for! From the outside the venue looked like a painting - from the picturesque views of the countryside, to the swans swimming on the moat! The manor house itself has so much character, and has a lovely homely feel to it as you walk around it. Our guests were equally blown away by the venue!

A big thing for us was that it’s dog friendly, which meant we could have our two dogs join us on our special day, it wouldn’t have been the same without them there! They had so much fun walking around the grounds and greeting all of our guests!

Nina, our coordinator, and her team were always available to answer any of our questions in the run up to the day. This really put us at ease, knowing we were in safe hands. On the day, Nina and the team made sure everything ran smoothly and went above and beyond to ensure our guests were looked after. A shout out to Amy who heads up catering and Mark who manages the bar. The food and drinks were absolutely fantastic!

I highly recommend this venue! There’s a reason Brinsop is an award winning venue - and when you visit it’s not hard to see why. We are already looking forward to going back there for a date night next year! Thanks for everything Team Brinsop!

V26,The Manor at Bickley,"The Manor is the perfect venue for weddings! When our wedding venue fell through 4 months before the big day, I stumbled onto the Manor at Bickley and spoke to Craig. He was most helpful and kind and went above and beyond to make sure our wedding went ahead.

We hired the venue for our two day wedding and the staff were helpful and accommodating from start to finish. All of our guests were awed by the beautiful well kept grounds and the excellent service. We can’t thank the staff enough for making our wedding dreams a reality. They thought of every detail from bringing us champagne after our civil ceremony to making sure we had our card box at the end of the night! We are excited to head back to celebrate our anniversary there!"
V26,The Manor at Bickley,"Myself and my Husband chose this venue for our wedding last week and we can’t sing The Manor’s praises enough. From our very first enquiry, to the first viewing of the venue, right though until the big day, the staff at the manor have been nothing short of brilliant! Each staff member we came across was polite and accommodating. Special mention to Craig and Vicky with whom we did most of our liaising throughout the months leading up until our wedding. Craig and Vicky were super helpful, responsive and went above and beyond to make sure that we could have the day of our dreams. Even with last minute changes due to the weather, Craig who was just incredible throughout, managed to help us sort a backup plan so our day would still go ahead seamlessly.

The rooms at the manor were spacious and modern, giving us and our wedding party lots of space for photographers and videographers to capture the special moments on our wedding morning.

The lodge that was used for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready was fabulous. The manor was very flexible in giving us early access so we could get ready on time.

The grand marquee was definitely grand! Very spacious and when decorated looked like something out of a fairytale! lots of kitchen space, a huge bar and fantastic overhead speakers for the party!

The manor was super flexible to our needs regarding access, start times, outsourcing our vendors and much more. The venue is beautiful and spacious with options for outdoor and indoor events and entertainment. The grounds were absolutely beautiful, so many lovely spots for photos not only for us as the bride and groom but for guests too!

A very special thank you to our point of contact throughout, Craig. From our first meeting, he was charming, bubbly and made us feel super welcome. He reassured us that he has experience in African/Caribbean weddings and that our wedding day would amazing and it was. He was attentive and always let us know that he was only a phone call or e-mail away and was always quick to respond and answer any questions we had.

All in all, we had the most beautiful day at The manor and we would definitely recommend this venue for a wedding or other events.

V26,The Manor at Bickley,"We hired The Manor at Bickley for my daughters wedding. Got a brilliant service from the venue. Everything was set accordingly, as per floor plan. Our guests were loved the venue grounds/facilities and the overall wedding set up.

V27,Davenport House,We are so pleased we chose Davenport House for our wedding reception. Charley and the team were so helpful and thoughtful. Putting canapés behind the bar for us and making sure everything ran so smoothly. I am obsessed with the stunning house and grounds and it was absolutely perfect! Thank you so much for making our day so special!!
V27,Davenport House,"Davenport House is a STUNNING wedding venue so how could we not have it for our big day!?

The staff were exceptional! From the moment we booked through to our big day, we had an absolute blast and could not thank each member of staff enough! Special shout out to Jared (hopefully spelt right, haha!) who made sure we were fed, watered and ensured we took 5 minutes to ourselves every moment we could - Also even saved us slices of pie wedding cake before we went to bed!

Our guests have said they have never been to a wedding so spectacular, with the most amazing food and amazing staff so could not have been happier having Davenport as our venue! 🩷"
V27,Davenport House,"I just wanted to write to say a huge, enormous thank you to Charley and all the team at Davenport House. We still can’t believe how perfect our day was, and lots of our guests have told us it’s the best wedding they’ve ever been to. The team were all a huge part of making that happen. It was incredibly seamless and well planned on the day, meaning we genuinely didn’t have to think about a thing, except for enjoying ourselves. The day ran to schedule perfectly and even certain touches we didn’t know or expect to happen were planned by you and the team, which made the day even more special. Thank you so much for giving us our dream wedding day. We can’t wait to see the full set of pictures and the video now to relive it all!"
V27,Davenport House,"Without doubt the best day of our lives. From start to finish, Davenport has exceeded expectations. From the very first impression of the venue during the open day, the incredible food tasting evening, all the way through to the day itself, including the support and preparation leading up to it. It was really important to us to pick a venue that not only ticked the fairytale box, but also come with the complete support of a wedding planner, due to our busy jobs. We were lucky enough to have Charley as ours. She really took the time to listen and get to know us, to ensure the day was tailored to exactly what we wanted. We even had our own cocktail designed, which went down an absolute storm on the day! She considered every little detail, constantly putting our minds at ease, which made the whole process so easy and enjoyable. Honestly the day couldn’t have gone smoother, any anxiety or stress faded immediately as soon as we got to the venue. It was simply perfect. So many of our guests were complimentary of just how beautiful the venue is and just how well organised the day was, and that is the perfect way to summarise Davenport. Any prospective couples thinking of selecting Davenport as their venue, hesitate no further. It will be a day you never knew was possible! We cannot thank you enough Charley and the Davenport team, if only we could live the day over and over again"
V27,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was amazing. When looking for a venue we weren't just looking for something wow, we needed to have people who were enthused and passionate about their work - we found that at Davenport House.

From our first phone call & meeting with Lizzie and Tallulah, we knew this was the place for us. Having two brides wasn’t an issue; combining British, Asian and Spanish cultures - wasn't an issue; having brides enter together – wasn’t an issue. Nothing was an issue. At Davenport House, we got it all – a picturesque venue and the best team of staff anyone could ever wish for. All our external suppliers have commented what a fantastic venue you are. All out guests have said that the service and attention to detail was second to none. The thoughtful touches like hiring a Spanish speaking waiter for the table which spoke very little English ensured that everyone felt welcomed. Guests with dietary requirements didn't feel they got a second rate meal or they were an afterthought - the food for all throughout the day was exceptional. The rooms / cottages where our guests and we stayed, spotless and comfortable. The thought behind adding some cheese and Spanish ham to the morning breakfast - so sweet!

Special shout out to Megan - wedding planner extraordinaire who kept in touch throughout the planning process and was exceptional on the day. Ian who worked tirelessly to ensure the day ran smoothly and the food was perfect, Charley who was also in charge of one bride and ensuring that everything was on point. All the staff were fantastic - polite, professional and personal.

Everyone keeps saying that this was the best wedding they have ever attended and that’s a lot of weddings between people! When we asked why, they say things like ‘the venue’, ‘the staff’, but it all came back to the inclusivity, love & joy that they felt – and you were all a part of that.

Davenport House is a stunning venue made even better by those who work there. If you want the whole package on your wedding day, we strongly recommend you book them.

Thank you to the entire Davenport House team.

Sat and Ana xx"
V27,Davenport House,"Where to begin with our beautiful venue and thanking the people who made it all happen! We got married in November at Davenport House and it was easily the best day of our lives. We chose Davenport because we wanted to host our cosy winter wedding in a big grand house in the country, with all the grandeur and class but to still feel like an intimate celebration with our family and closest friends, and it was perfect in delivering just that. It is utterly beautiful, the location was perfect and exactly what we wanted. The food was absolutely AMAZING, we had so many compliments from our guests and we are so grateful for the team in delivering such a fabulous wedding breakfast. Thank you so much to Lizzie who couldn’t do more to help us have our dream day, and Ian who delivered the best service to us and our guests (the pizza at 2am was very much appreciated)

Massive massive thank you to Charley our wedding planner, who was so so helpful throughout our wedding planning process and on the day, I can’t thank her enough. She was always there whenever I needed her, helped me so much with creating our dream day and I will be forever grateful to her for keeping me sane! Whenever I had any worries I knew she was just a phone call away, which helped me a lot when planning a wedding!

Charley, Lizzie and Ian thank you for everything - best team ever. Our day was seamless and it was all down to you and your incredible team.

V27,Davenport House,"Me and my (now) wife chose Davenport House as our wedding venue in mid 2022, to get married in September 2023, and it was the best decision we could have made. We looked at a range of Georgian style manor house type venues located in Cheshire, North Wales and the West Midlands areas. It blew all of the competition away in terms of the venue aesthetics, the balance in design (i.e. period characteristics vs modern design), the impressive condition of the property for its age plus what it offered for our wedding weekend.

Staff and service - In the UK, this is usually something that is average at best - if you're lucky. At Davenport House, the service from all staff was 10/10. I honestly don't think we've ever had better service for anything. We had a wedding planner from the start (Megan), who was an absolute saint and was fundamental in making the whole wedding a success. She was also instrumental in helping us find a way for our 'little' dog Bernie to be a part of the main event. Thanks Megan!

Accommodation - The fantastic condition, design and decor for Davenport House extends to all areas of the estate. The rooms are fantastic, very big, well maintained and cleaned religiously by the venue. We had no issues or problems from all of the guests who stayed onsite over the 3 days.

Food and drink - This got a lot of deserved praise from the guests too. We got to tailor our entire menu and it worked perfectly for what we wanted for the 3 days. The oyster bar and luxurious charcuterie board went down particularly well the day before the wedding.

I could keep writing much, much more on how fantastic this venue was for our wedding. But the best advice I could give for any interested couples is to go and visit it in person and reach out to Davenport House with any questions. Our own wedding ended up becoming both perfect and the best wedding we've ever been to. Thanks guys again!"
V27,Davenport House,"Fantastic location.
Great staff.
Beautiful place to get married.
I can wait to film here again soon thanks for having me."
V27,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was a fairytale, everything we could have dreamed of and more. Lizzie and Charley were fantastic in their support, organisation and professionalism in planning our wedding. The venue is simply spectacular- breathtaking. Our guests were blown away. The day ran so smoothly it was simply perfect. The food was out of this world our guests couldn't get enough. All the staff at the house went above and beyond to ensure we were happy and having a great day. The team were also extremely supportive of last minute changes/additions. The Davenport experience was truly wonderful and I'm sad to see it end right from our initial meetings, food tasting and finally our special day. Thank you: Lizzie, Charley, Ian and all of the team for a truly memorable day for us and our guests. Mr and Mrs Kissane"
V27,Davenport House,"We got married at Davenport House in February and they provided us with the most perfect day. Lizzie, Charley, Ian and the rest of the team were the best hosts we could have hoped for. Nothing was too much to ask and the guests all commented on the hospitality shown to them. The setting is utterly gorgeous, our weather was less than favourable so we did not make the most of the grounds but this didn't matter, the house was setting enough and so atmospheric! The food was utterly AMAZING and better than most restaurant food I have eaten. The venue feels intimate and grand at the same time.
I literally cannot recommend this place enough, they gave us the wedding we had always wanted and more!"

V29,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge on 12 May 2023 and it was incredible. The views are gorgeous and the photo opportunities are endless with beautiful floral and green surroundings. The team were super responsive throughout the process which is really reassuring and helpful when planning a wedding, and Nelson who ran the day was just fantastic. Every single detail was thought of and they run a really slick operation. This is essential as it meant I had a lot less to think about! They put me and my partner at ease throughout. The food and service on the day was fantastic, so many of our guests said this was the best food they’ve ever had at a wedding. Highly recommend! (Photos by Costa Weddings UK)"
V29,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","Pembroke where super helpful and provided a lot of guidance in helpful forms and layouts. Always available for a call and very helpful. on the day, it ran super smooth and and staff where lovely. Thank yo for making it a great day!"
V29,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge in October 2024. The whole day was magical, including the beautiful view over the autumn trees in Richmond Park. Robert made sure everything ran perfectly and helped us to find slots in the busy wedding timetable to fit in some special moments to also reflect traditions from my husband's Dutch culture. The food was great and the staff were polite and fun. All preparation with Lucy was also smooth and done with a smile. The Pembroke Lodge team ooze experience but make every wedding feel special and really listen to your wishes for the day. Highly recommend! Thank you to the whole Pembroke Lodge team, especially Robert, Lucy, the kitchen team and the staff on the day!"
V29,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park",The staff has been very helpful. They have a lot of experience. Open to any suggestions and help in critical situations.
V29,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue than Pembroke Lodge for our summer wedding. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most gorgeous backdrop for our special day. A huge thank you to our banqueting manager, Nelson, who went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly.

The team was incredibly supportive and accommodating throughout the planning process, making it an enjoyable and stress-free experience. Their professionalism and attention to detail made all the difference, and we’re so grateful for everything they did to make our day unforgettable. Highly recommend!"
V29,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We got married on the 3rd of October this year, and the team made our day magical! What a smooth day. We loved every second of it! The guests loved everything, and raved about the food and organisation.
Hiring Pembroke Lodge was easy. We had a viewing where all information was shared in detail and super clear to understand and make a decision.
On the months leading up to the big day our contact was Alice. Alice is a star. Responsive, professional, and had answers and solutions to everything.
On the day, Nelson coordinated the whole thing, minute by minute, and we are forever grateful for his politeness, professionalism and high spirits. We felt safe and in good hands. I would give Pembroke Lodge way over 5 stars if I could :)"
V29,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","My wedding went without a hitch, thanks to the amazing team at Pembroke Lodge (special thanks to Nicola & Robert)! They made sure everything was set up perfectly on the day, exactly in the way we had requested, and then ensured the day itself went as smoothly as we could've hoped. Everything looked beautiful and the stunning views made all of our guests fall in love with the venue too."
V29,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had the most perfect day. The team have all been so responsive and accommodating of our every request. The venue is beautiful and we were lucky to have gorgeous sunset views. It is truly a countryside wedding but conveniently close to London, which was important for our overseas guests. The food was fantastic and staff were professional and efficient. Would recommend to anyone."
V29,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We recently had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge, and I cannot say enough good things about the venue, the team and manager, Robert. From the moment we started planning to the big day itself, he was absolutely incredible.

Robert went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. He was always available to answer our questions, offer solutions, and provide creative suggestions that enhanced our vision. He coordinated effortlessly with our vendors, making sure everyone was on the same page, which took so much stress off our shoulders.

On the day of the wedding, he was a true rockstar! He made sure the timeline flowed perfectly, from setting up the ceremony space to ensuring the reception transitions were seamless. His dedication and hands-on approach allowed us to enjoy every moment without worrying about a single thing.

Our wedding was a dream come true, and we owe so much of that to him and the team! Thank you, for everything you all did to make our day magical."
V29,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We could not have wished for a better wedding venue for our special day! Everyone went above and beyond to make sure our day goes perfectly without us having to worry about a single thing! A big shoutout to Nelson who was absolutely brilliant and made the day feel so calm and well thought through.

The food was delicious and all the team was so welcoming and super helpful on the day.

Thank you so much, we really really appreciate all the help!"
V30,The Hackney,"If you are having a wedding for under 60 people then this is your place! From start to finish the communication and planning of the wedding was seamless and took so much of the stress out of the day. The totally customisable packages that they offer really does suit anyone’s budget and more importantly regardless of what package you end up going for it is value for money. The food was delicious and it catered to everyone’s tastes including a pregnant guest, halal, vegan and lactose intolerant and was the talking point for our guests. The venue itself is stunning! Lots of exposed brick, they had recently redecorated before our wedding and the reception room that doubled up as the dance floor was styled simply but made a statement and the outdoor covered patio area was a welcome addition. The team understood our vision from the get go and they completely nailed it, all of our guests couldn’t believe it was here! I honestly can’t recommend it enough if you’re wanting a small and intimate wedding venue but still with all the class. I would say to future couples even if you think this wouldn’t be your venue please please do have a proper look because it will change your mind, I had come across this venue multiple times over the course of a year and decided to take a leap of faith and give it a chance and we’re so happy we did."
V30,The Hackney,"We can’t recommend the Hackney highly enough. They made the whole process so easy and they offer so much in-house which we took advantage of. The food was especially great - our guests were amazed “best food I’ve ever had at a wedding” and the team took great care of us during the planning stages.

They offer a very customisable service with scalable pricing. If you’re having a fairly small wedding (under 60) then you must check out The Hackney.

We had such a perfect day and we owe so much of that to the fabulous venue. Beautiful space, so professionally run."
V30,The Hackney,"We had such a brilliant experience working with the team at The Hackney. We were regularly in touch throughout the planning process and the use of the shared spreadsheet was especially handy for keeping everyone informed.
We had to postpone our wedding two days before as we were both sick with COVID, and the team were just fantastic. They waited for us to recover and then we started to talk through options again. We were able to rebook just six months after our original date, and the team were accomodating and understanding throughout the process.
The day itself was perfect. Lots of our guests commented on the quality and quantity of the food and Hugo was great at keeping everything to time. We wish we could do it all again."
V30,The Hackney,"We had our wedding reception here and wow was it amazing. Hugo, Erika and the whole team were amazing. Every single guest commented on how delicious and plentiful the food was. The staff were amazing nothing was too much to ask and all so happy.
The venue itself was decorated amazingly, given we left our wedding stationary etc up to the venue it exceeded our expectations. I was concerned about the allowed decibel level for Dj / entertainment but it was plenty loud enough. I wish I could relive the day again, if you’re thinking about booking The Hackney do it! You will not regret!"
V30,The Hackney,"We held our wedding reception at The Hackney in July and it was truly the best experience. We opted for a standing reception for our 65 guests, serving food bowl-style for a more relaxed, less formal feel. The food was absolutely delicious and there was lots of it - it just kept coming! Our guests are still raving about how good the food was months later! Lots of good drinks options too - we especially like the cocktails here!

The staff on the night were so friendly, welcoming and were amazing with our children guests too!

The Hackney is such an aesthetic venue with exposed brick walls and existing foliage which we loved, so we kept additional decorations to a minimum. We dropped our decorations to The Hackney the day before and picked them up the day after, which was super easy! We hadn’t given them too much direction with where we wanted everything placed but when we turned up to the venue on the day it was truly perfect! The staff know exactly what they’re doing and had decorated it beautifully! The outdoor seating area is a great feature too (especially for our two greyhounds who chilled out there for the majority of the reception!)

We opted for a simple Spotify playlist for our music and their sound system was good.

The wedding planning process was super easy from start to finish, with continued support and check-ins from Hugo, from the moment we booked, to the day itself! We really enjoyed the menu tasting experience earlier in the year too, which is a great touch in the build up to the big day! The planning spreadsheet was easy to use and made us feel content and relaxed, knowing that everything was under control.

Overall, we would highly recommend The Hackney to anyone looking for an affordable, dog-friendly, wedding reception venue with a laidback vibe, delicious food and lovely friendly staff! We look forward to coming back every year to celebrate our anniversary, with an espresso martini!"
V30,The Hackney,"We hosted our wedding reception with the team at the hackney in May 2023. The planning experience was straight forward and easy to book. The availability for the venue is on the website so easy to see when they have and get it booked. We went with the 5 canapés, bowl food menu, and drinks on arrival with wine through the event. The staff were brilliant and food delicious.

We loved the vibe of the venue as we wanted a bit more of a casual event, with a relaxed feel and we were able to host our 85 guests with no issues (although limited to standing event at this size, there is enough scattered seating for anyone to sit when they wanted).

In terms of decorating, we didn't feel the need to add any extra flowers as the venue was already so made up with plants and other decorations.

We did add the photo box which I highly recommend, was great fun for our friends and family and came with a memory book. People were shy at first but really got into it. We also used the recommended baker who provided a delicious cake.

Final area to mention - pricing. Wedding venues can be really expensive and daunting before you even start paying for any food or drink. Something that really attracted us to this venue was the low spacing cost and the minimum spend with it. It meant that we were able to completely customise the experience and see where the money we were spending was going. There are many different options and packages to go with, so it's up to you.

Only thing that wasn't offered was any tasting of the food beforehand which we would've liked to have done but none the less, the food was delicious so it wasn't really needed!

To finish, we loved every moment of it and hope that many others get to experience the same. Thank you very much team at the hackney!"
V30,The Hackney,"We had our reception in July. The venue was cosy and comfortably fit 30 people without feeling too crowded or too empty (we were worried it might be too empty). We managed to fit a band in, arranged mini-golf in the venue after dinner, and customize the cocktail menu with custom recipe (that we provided before hand).

One of the biggest highlights was the food. The crispy roast pork got so many complements and indeed it was tasty. But really, all the dishes were amazing (we had a tasting session prior), it was hard to choose, but the taste of each dish was still top notch on the day itself too. I heard that the supper snacks we ordered were great too but alas, I was too busy and they were snapped up instantly!

Some other details:
* We were allowed to use the small room downstairs as a private space to put our stuff. Very handy to not mess up items.
* We went with a bar tab and kept increasing the budget each time till the end of the night instead of the all-you-can-drink. From our rough calculations, it worked out about the same going for all-you-can-drink. Of course, certain folk were heavy weights and more than made it up will be different for each crowd.
* Lighting for photos came out excellent (combination of photographer and venue lighting).
* You can adjust air conditioning to suit the weather (we had ours on the warm side due to older folk not dealing with cold too well).
* Outdoor space was a pleasant change in atmosphere for those who wanted some fresh air.

What about the review from the Bride? Bride approved this review."
V30,The Hackney,"The day was fabulous - Hugo was brilliant and flexible with what we were after. The tasting day before was such a great idea and the whole experience and guidance given made planning a wedding in c.5 months so much easier. We had vegans, last minute drop outs, ridiculously hot weather, about 3 different spotify playlists, a string quartet, florists arriving in the morning and a cake that arrived the day before - the team took it all in their stride and it seemed like a breeze. Loved it all and we've had such good feedback from guests. A fabulous whirlwind.

Two very minor points for feedback - we maxed out the guest numbers (the team did advise us against it but were very accommodating despite us also throwing musicians into the mix) and it was a little too crowded pre-lunch on such a hot day. We also put some speeches in between courses (again, we were recommended against it) and that may have been a slight mistake for the dessert timings, as the tasting day was 10/10. But, it was a perfect day in a stunning venue. Loved it - thank you guys."
V30,The Hackney,"Jon and the team were absolute superstars, hosting the perfect wedding day for us. The space is beautiful, the decor is modern and perfect. They were so accommodating for any request or question we had which we really appreciated. Guests commented on how great the cocktails were! The day ran so smoothly and we had a fantastic time."
V30,The Hackney,"From the initial phonecall to the warm welcome we got when we first visited The Hackney, we knew we were in safe hands and that we’d made the perfect choice. The venue offers the most beautiful interiors - the perfect mix of cosy, intimate and modern industrial - exactly what we were looking for!

Our entire experience with The Hackney was an absolute dream -we loved the mega organised approach to planning. Something that could have been incredibly intimidating was made so straightforward with the amazing support of Hugo the General Manager who embraced all our weird and wonderful suggestions and gave expert advice on what we could do to make things even better. We left every meeting buzzing with ideas and even more excited to welcome our closest friends and family to the big day.

The quality of the food and drinks is impeccable - every single one of our guests (even the fussiest!) has commented on how much they loved it. We absolutely loved the menu tasting, even though it made the decision even harder as everything was amazing. What makes it even better for us is living close by and being able to pop into our wedding venue for a coffee or a cocktail!

I couldn't recommend The Hackney enough - I just wish we could go back and do it all again!"
V31,PYRÁ,"We held our wedding reception at Pyra. We booked the entire venue, with the upstairs loft serving as a dance floor with bar and downstairs having tables and seating for guests.  Canapes were served upstairs and a buffet dinner was served downstairs.  We lucked out with great April weather, so guests were also able to enjoy Pyra’s patio and additional space on Lonsdale Road. We were very happy with our decision to have our reception at Pyra, and many of our guests commented on how lovely the space was, how nice the staff were, and how delicious the food was.
 
The venue:
The space is gorgeous with lots of natural light upstairs.  Guests arrived at 4pm but we had the venue for the entire day, and Pyra gave our florist access earlier to set up beautiful flower arrangements and candles - it looked stunning.  Pyra set up our welcome sign and card box too. The venue also accepted delivery of our cake on the morning of the wedding which was a huge help, set it up very nicely upstairs, and cut it for us after the formal “cake cutting” shots.  We were able to coordinate with Pyra ahead of time to arrange the space how we wanted, such as how many tables we wanted downstairs and the set-up of the loft upstairs.  They even had a microphone ready for us upstairs so we could say a few words to our guests before our cake cutting. Perfect! For the evening dancing, we were able to set the disco lighting to our colour scheme, which worked really well with candles and foliage (latter 2 provided by our florist).
 
The food:
The buffet dinner was fantastic.  Pyra gave us multiple menu items to choose from and we were able to fix a nice menu that took into account guests’ dietary restrictions.  We initially booked the venue when it had a different chef and menu.  We came in a few months before our wedding to try the new menu – our dinner was delicious then and there was no dip in quality for the buffet-style served at our reception. Fionn worked with us how to plan best - because we wanted a relaxed style with a dance floor upstairs, we ended up feeding our 80 guests in two sittings downstairs, which worked perfectly. The upstairs space can seat 60 people, which didn’t work for how we planned our event, but does look really nice in photos. The late night food served around 10pm also went down very well.
 
The staff:
The staff, including the bartenders and waiters, were hardworking, friendly and very nice to guests.  Enough staff were around that guests never had to wait long for drinks.  Members of staff cut our cake for us and also boxed up the late night food for guests to bring home.  Fionn, the day-of coordinator, was on-site for our entire reception and was very helpful, even helping coordinate our midnight bus arrival.
 
Responsiveness:
Overall we were happy with the responsiveness of the venue.  It took a little while to nail down the final details of the food menu and drinks menu/bar tab but we were ultimately very happy with the result.  As the venue hosts more weddings/ larger-scale events we’d expect this will improve.

Overall:
We highly recommend Pyra for a wedding reception. We had 80 guests in total, which worked very well for the canapes/cocktail hour upstairs (4-6pm), sit-down buffet downstairs (6-8pm, split into two seatings) and dancing upstairs (8pm-midnight).  The upstairs loft was able to fit all 80 guests plus a four-piece band.  Lonsdale Road is also a charming street that provided great photo opportunities.  We looked into several other venues, and came away happy with Pyra's quote – we were able to book the venue, food (including canapes, dinner and late night food) and a generous bar tab for roughly the amount some other London venues were charging for just their space (no food or drink included). We and our guests had a fantastic time. Thanks so much to Fionn and the Pyra team :)"
V31,PYRÁ,"We had our wedding celebration at Lula. We booked the loft and restaurant for this.

Positives:
The venue is beautiful and needs minimal decoration.
The food was amazing; the chef is truly professional and everyone loved it.
They redecorated the restaurant section and added a set of couches to make it a lounge, which was beautiful.
The staff was very hardworking, professional, and lovely.

They provided us with a lounge, a wedding breakfast space and a dance floor.

Flexibility with Cake:
The bakery was scheduled to deliver and set up the cake at 16:45, but they delivered it at 09:45 instead. The Lula team handled the situation professionally by storing the cake and setting it up at the correct time. They presented the cake beautifully and assisted in cutting it into nice pieces. It could not have been more perfect.


The list of available drinks was huge, and they were happy to make custom drinks and bring in different juices if requested in advance. The event manager tried to accommodate every wish we had, and on the day we could not have hoped for more. Most of our guests said it was one of the best weddings and most beautiful venues they had ever been to.

Negatives:
Food tasting for the wedding menu was not included, which we had assumed would be, but it was given at a 50% discount. We had to sort out the floral decoration last minute, as they had initially suggested they would arrange it for us after providing a budget, but later said we needed to find our own. At times, they were a bit slow to respond, which made us anxious, but after communicating with them, this was resolved, and communication was very swift.

In conclusion:
Lula gave us the most beautiful wedding we could have dreamt of. We highly recommend them. The venue, the food, the service were amazing, and we could not have hoped for more."
V32,Sandon Manor,"We had such a special wedding at Sandon Manor, the team made every effort to make our day so so special and we will be forever grateful for that. A dream team! The day ran so smoothly and they worked so hard. The venue is unique with lots of different spaces which unfold throughout the day, which was perfect as our wedding fell on a wet and windy autumnal day. We would highly recommend Sandon Manor!"
V32,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor provided the perfect venue for our wedding. From the initial conversations and meetings with the team, we knew we were in safe hands and had made the right choice. They kept us informed with any events, made information a bit payments clear and reassured us with any query we had.
The accommodation was exceptional and fitted our requirements perfectly, with high quality finishing touches throughout to ensure our stay was as comfortable as possible.
The wedding venue was incredible! Our ceremony took place in the gorgeously modern barn with stunning draping and greenery. Following on, we had a blissful drinks reception which was on the expertly manicured lawn (with mini golf!) and sun-trap of a courtyard. We then moved onto our wedding breakfast which was held in the main barn, seating all of our guests comfortably with space for decor and extra details. Following from dinner, the part started and the club room came to life! This was absolutely the talking point of the day and our guests raved about how incredible it was! It managed to create a club-like atmosphere, whilst maintaining the vibe, albeit at a reduced volume, in the rest of the barn. The layout of the venue was important to us, as it ensured our guests never strayed too far, to keep the momentum of the day.
The team at Sandon worked superbly with all of vendors which ensured the day ran smoothly from set up to clearing. All of our vendors commented on how much they too loved working there.
The venue, the aesthetics, the staff, everything was perfect! We would absolutely recommend to anyone getting married."
V32,Sandon Manor,"We cannot recommend Sandon Manor enough. From the quality of the service, the helpfulness and friendliness of the team, the beautiful accommodation and the most amazing venue which all or guests loved partying the night away in. To make it even more special the Manor is in amazing grounds in beautiful countryside and nature reserves.
Sandon Manor made our dream come true."
V32,Sandon Manor,"I couldn't recommend Sandon Manor highly enough - from our first enquiry to our Wedding, nothing was too much trouble. The team are so friendly and easy to communicate with, very approachable and responsive. They respond to any questions immediately and having the day before to set up with Tom was fantastic. Styaying in the Manor House and Dovecote was the icing on the cake as to be with friends and family the night before and the day after was so fabulous. On the day Tom and the team were absolutely fantastic and couldn't have done more to make our special day. We couldn't have dreamt of anywhere more perfect than Sandon Manor - a huge thank you to all the staff."
V32,Sandon Manor,"If you are considering Sandon Manor for your wedding venue, I beg you: scratch it off your list now. Yes, the house and grounds are beautiful, but the people behind it are absolutely awful. They ruined our wedding experience.

I will get straight to it. Sandon Manor has a very strict policy on guests leaving the site by 11:30pm (and no one is allowed back to the Manor unless they’re official guests staying overnight). We had lots of international guests at our wedding. Many hadn’t seen each other in years and would be jetlagged - we thought they may be keen to continue chatting after 11:30pm. With this in mind, we made a booking with Sandon Village Hall via our contacts at the church (where we were attending services and later married). They granted us access to the village hall until 1am as a contingency spill over space.

We mentioned this in passing during our online meeting with one of the Sandon Manor team a month before our wedding. Within hours, I received a voicemail from the lady in charge of Village Hall bookings saying (quote) “someone at Sandon Manor is trying to throw a spanner into the works for you”. It soon transpired that they had raised an official complaint to the parish council and pressurised the village hall team into cancelling our booking. To be clear, Sandon village Hall and Sandon Manor are entirely separate entities – there is no crossover between them whatsoever, as the owner of Sandon Manor later acknowledged.

It gets worse. Gob smacked, we asked Kate – the owner of Sandon Manor – for a call to find out what was going on. She was abhorrent, trying to justify her meddling as a necessary measure to protect her wedding license (side note: with Sandon Manor it is always about the money – once your deposit is paid they care nothing for your ‘special day’; you are just another cash cow). Did she apologise for stabbing us, her clients, in the back? No, she did not. She could not even fathom how hurt we were by being completely bypassed in the communication chain and how deceitful and disrespectful this was. My husband and I were quite literally left speechless. We’ve never experienced this sort of treatment from anyone, let alone our wedding venue - to whom we were paying many thousands of pounds. Dealing with this stress in the final month of wedding prep really took its toll on us and soured things. We no longer looked forward to our day, rather dreaded what Sandon Manor might do next.

Aside from this major incident, there were many other occasions when Sandon Manor were unhelpful and unfeeling in their interactions with us:

- We enquired if it would be possible to arrange a large pizza takeaway order instead of using Sandon Manor’s caterer for our late night food. One of the team explained on a call that this wasn’t contractually possible; we acknowledged this. We then received an email saying ‘If you are unable to follow this or any other of our T&C's we would be happy to cancel your booking.’ This was less than a month before our wedding.
- We had a harpist perform in the church. We were told she wasn’t allowed to play during our drinks reception in the grounds due to potential noise complaints (an acoustic harp at 2pm in the afternoon). No other music was permitted outside the house.
- Sandon Manor is an incredibly expensive (in hindsight, grossly overpriced) venue. But we were also hit with hidden fees when booking their accommodation option - an extra £425 ‘cleaning fee’ was added to our bill.
- At the time of booking, Sandon was running a promotion waivering the £700 fee for hiring their ceremony space. As we were marrying at the church, we asked if it would please be possible to put this towards other elements of our day i.e. using their festoon string of lights in the barn (for which they charge £450). They refused.
- We were unsure about booking the 1-bed Dovecote on the grounds as - at £499 for the weekend - it was a considerable expense. While we were deciding Sandon Manor rented it out on Air BnB (to one of our guests, which made for a very awkward conversation).

To summarise, you only get one wedding day. Kate and her team absolutely ruined ours. There are so many other lovely venues in north Hertfordshire run by decent, humane people. Please prioritise your happiness and choose wisely. I wish we had."
V32,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor is a stunning wedding venue with a great team behind it. The exclusive use of the manor for the weekend was a highlight, allowing us to relax with friends and family in the lead up to and after the big day. The Sandon team were brilliant, guiding us through the planning process and ensuring everything ran smoothly on the day. We couldn't have asked for a better place and team to help us celebrate our big day."
V32,Sandon Manor,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our special day. Holly, Tom and the rest of the brilliant team made us feel welcome from day one. Special mention to Tom for making the day run so seamlessly, so professional and accommodating of all our needs.

The venue itself is stunning, located in the beautiful Hertfordshire countryside. The Manor House makes for a tremendous location to prepare, and the Dovecote suite is a nice touch: a great addition for the groom to spend the last night. We loved the small details of the characteristic main venue, with the botanical feel to the bar a great backdrop to the barn.

It’s a shame we can’t stay every week!

Dan & Suzanne"
V32,Sandon Manor,"To Holly, Louise, Tom & Kate, wow, what can we say but the biggest thank you for the best day of our lives! When we viewed the beautiful venue over two years ago we just knew instantly Sandon Manor was the one, not just because it’s stunning, but you guys are amazing! Thank you for making all our wedding dreams come true. Forever grateful and can’t wait to return to reminisce. Lots of love, the new Mr & Mrs Jakes xxx"
V32,Sandon Manor,"From the moment we visited Sandon Manor we knew this would be our wedding venue for 9 September 2023. Seeing the spectacular finish of the house carry through to the completed venue just shows the high level of attention to detail this venue had to offer.

Holly, Tom and the rest of the team filled us with confidence right from our first interactions, annd went above and beyond on the wedding weekend itself to facilitate us, our suppliers and guests. The main house, dovecote, annex and extensive grounds were a wonderful way to have close family stay with us on site, and so handy to be able to all get ready nearby the morning of.

Thank you for making our wedding weekend a truly memorable occasion, for us and our families. We all look back on this day with the happiest, sunniest memories and Sandon Manor will always have a very special place in our hearts."
V32,Sandon Manor,"We had the most amazing wedding weekend at Sandon Manor.

The venue itself is the perfect backdrop for a wedding, our photos looked amazing from every single angle. There were so many spaces to make use of throughout the day which helped things to run incredibly smoothly and meant we didn’t need to have a ‘turnaround’ during the evening. The spaces really wowed our guests and created such a lovely atmosphere. Including the ‘club room’ dance floor that had our guests dancing until the very last song!

We stayed at the Manor House for the weekend, extending our wedding into a perfect weekend retreat. The house itself is beautiful, with lots of different areas for everyone to relax, and the perfect peaceful location to chill the night before the big day!

From our first viewing to checking out the day after our wedding, the Sandon staff were attentive, friendly and helped us feel relaxed and looked after throughout an otherwise overwhelming process. We’d highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for a beautiful, peaceful and unique wedding venue!"
V33,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Thank you so much to the entire team for making our wedding so special! Thanks to Donique, MJ, Mo, Harry and everyone else for helping us organise our day and for their professional but friendly attitude. Merchant Taylors is such a beautiful venue and offers a brilliant layout and different spaces to make the day so special!"
V33,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you all so very much for such an amazing wedding on Saturday. You all worked tirelessly to make it so special. Everything was truly wonderful and you all did me proud! Both Hugh and I couldn’t have asked for anything more in terms of being so well looked after. Our guests were so impressed and have given us so many compliments on a brilliantly well run event. Thank you all again for playing a brilliant part in our truly wonderful day of which we loved every minute
V33,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you so much for the most wonderful wedding reception at the end of April. We had the perfect day and our guests all commented on how well looked after they has been. Thank you again for all your hard work!
V33,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"We know this is very late (we have no excuse), but we wanted to say thank you for everything you and the team at Merchant Taylor's did for us on our wedding day. All the guests have since told us how much they loved the venue, food and service. Fingers crossed you get a few couples getting in touch! Again, Thank You for everything!"
V33,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"My brother and I attended the wedding today, as Florist's for the wedding party.
We were treated fantastically well by ALL the staff that we met, nothing was too much trouble and they made our task a COMPLETE pleasure.
If this is how they treat the actual wedding party then you will have a unforgettable time. Many thanks to all the staff for helping us to do our job with ease ."
V33,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Zara,

Can we thank you and your team at Merchant Taylor’s Hall for all your hard work in making Caroline and Neil’s recent wedding so very special. You, in particular, were able to deal with every question and request in a really professional manner.

Merchant Taylors’ Hall is part of the rich panoply of history and tradition, which makes this great City. All of our guests, and in particular those from abroad, were totally spell bound by the atmosphere, the food and service.

James was superb in organising the whole operation. To turn the Great Hall from a wedding ceremony hall to a banqueting suite for 110 guests, including flowers, place settings and dance floor in ninety minutes was truly remarkable.

The food and wine was of an amazing standard, we know that Merchant Taylors’ Hall has a reputation for presenting some of the finest dining in the City of London. You certainly surpassed all expectations.

We have many wonderful memories of the 10th September 2016, but it is best summed up by our daughter Caroline, “Can we do it all over again?”."
V34,Garden Museum,I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate everything that you did to make our party such a success last Friday. It was brilliant being outside on such a lovely everning. Everyone was very impressed with the venue.
V34,Garden Museum,"Thank you for all your help, advice and on-the-day support, it really made our wedding very special and it certianly went off without a hitch! The Museum looked amazing and the garden was perfect, especially as the sunshine adn the guests wanted to make the most of the beautiful surroundings."
V35,Clearwell Castle,"Can’t tell you how wonderful the team were at Clearwell. Our wedding coordinator Phaedra was exceptional. Attention to detail and everyone of the team from front of house, waiting staff, groundsmen and the DJ made our day absolutely everything we dreamed of and unique to us.

Can’t recommend highly enough and cost was outstanding value for money.

So many our guest commented on the quality of the food and that it was the best wedding they had been too! The children loved the magic of the castle and opportunity to get outside and see the grounds.

The grooms family had a fabulous time staying in the cottages the night before and our guests at both the Castle & the Wyndham had a fabulous stay on the night of the wedding.

Wish we could do it all again!"
V35,Clearwell Castle,We had our wedding at Clearwell in June and we couldn’t recommend it highly enough. From start to finish everything was perfect and they went above and beyond to ensure we had an amazing day. I’d not hesitate in recommending them to any couples. Just a gorgeous place with staff that really care in making your day all that you hope it will be.
V35,Clearwell Castle,"From the moment we first visited Clearwell, we knew this was the venue for us. From the moment we started planning to the final touches on the day, all the staff were fantastic. Ann, our wedding coordinator, was a delight to work with throughout. Nothing was too much trouble and she kept us updated throughout. The day was tailored exactly to our needs and when we arrived at the venue on the day they had prepared everything perfectly.

We did the night before package which included rooms and food the evening before. We were supplied with so much food no one went hungry. The rooms in the Wyndham and the Castle are fantastically appointed.

The venue itself is gorgeous. The cellar bar downstairs adds a whole different dimension to the occasion where you can really let your hair down.

This was an absolute dream come true venue for us. We loved every single minute."
V35,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot fault this venue at all. We initially had to change our wedding date because of lockdown and they were so supportive and empathetic.
Ann, our coordinator, is quite possibly the loveliest person on the planet. She was always happy to answer any questions and it never felt like we were being a nuisances or asking a silly question.
On the morning of the wedding she was a lovely calm presence and the whole day just ran like clockwork.
The food was out of this world with many guests saying it was the best food they’d had at a wedding and one person actually thought we’d hired a Michellin Chef!
The venue is so so beautiful with plenty of space. The downstairs cellar was a great place to party the night away, it was like an exclusive nightclub. There were lots of quieter rooms for people who wanted some peace.
The DJ was brilliant, we forgot to give a list of songs we liked but he did a great job of guessing what we liked ( he must’ve looked at our age and figured nineties dance music was our era. And he was bang on the money)
I do not have a single complaint about this venue"
V35,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot speak highly enough about Clearwell Castle as a wedding venue. The venue itself is absolutely stunning. It rained on our wedding day but the indoor space was so vast and beautiful that ourselves and our guests still had the most amazing time! Our wedding co-ordinator, Phaedra, was absolutely incredible, both before and during the wedding. She was always so professional, replied to all of my emails (there were many) and answered all queries efficiently. On the day, we genuinely could not have managed without her. The day flowed so well with her guidance and it really helped me as the Bride as I felt I didn't need to worry about anything! All the other staff at Clearwell and at the Wyndham hotel were also so wonderful! Everyone worked so hard and every member of staff was so kind to us; it just made our day incredibly special and we are so appreciative to them all. The food was great, service very quick and all the guests really enjoyed it! We had so many compliments about the staff and venue! I honestly could not recommend Clearwell castle more as a wedding venue!"
V35,Clearwell Castle,"Our wedding on 10/11/23 was just the absolute perfect day from start to finish. Our wedding planner manager, Hannah, was incredible, not just on the day but throughout the whole planning process. She ensured everything ran smoothly on the day, sparing no details ensuring everything was just perfect and to time but without being stressful. She was very accommodating with the planning meetings working around both mine and my now Husband's shift patterns.
We both stayed the night before our wedding and the night of the wedding with many of our guests travelling a distance so also staying in the Wyndham which was very convenient. Staying in Keepers cottage with the Bridesmaids the night before added to the experience with the added feature of the hot tub, the groomsmen were very jealous. The beds were very comfortable and everyone was excited to stay in a castle.
On the day of the wedding, the staff were very accommodating moving the bridal party along to the bridal suite to finish preparations earlier than originally planned. The breakfast provided was the perfect amount for a busy morning getting ready. Everything, including the gardens, were immaculately kept adding to the WOW factor of getting married in a Castle.
The canapes served and welcome drinks were well received by the guests and ourselves whilst we had photographers prior to the wedding breakfast. The food was phenomenal and great portions and I was stuffed after. The staff were very accommodating for us with a lot of people with allergies, dislikes of mushrooms so adapting the menu for these individual people. We were even able to swap out a few bottles of wine included in our package for cocktails as us as the Bride and Groom did not drink wine.
As soon as we walked in the venue the first time, we knew it was the place we wanted to get married. Everytime we went back to view the venue again I fell more and more in love. For anyone thinking about viewing or even booking this incredible venue I would say do it! We will be going back for events in the future to relive the best day of our lives."
V35,Clearwell Castle,"We got married at Clearwell castle April 2023. What can I say it's the most perfect venue and we had the most amazing day. The organisation was amazing and the staff were great on the day and even leading up to the big day. Phaedra was our wedding planner and communication with her was great throughout and on our wedding day she ensured that it all ran smoothly. I cannot recommend Clearwell castle and their staff enough. Thank you again for helping us have our dream wedding.
Kind regards

Vanessa & David x"
V35,Clearwell Castle,"We had the most amazing wedding day on the 24th of November 2023, the whole day ran so smoothly and all our guests absolutely loved the venue. The food was amazing and our guests loved the fish and chip buffet in the evening! The whole progress of planning the wedding was so straight forward and Phedera was a great wedding manager."
V35,Clearwell Castle,"Clearwell Castle exceeded all our expectations for our wedding day. The moment we stepped onto the grounds, we were captivated by its timeless charm. The staff, especially Hannah, went above and beyond to make every detail perfect, ensuring a seamless and stress-free experience. The Ball Room, where we exchanged our vows, felt like something out of a storybook. The surrounding gardens provided a stunning backdrop for photos and added to the overall enchantment of the day. Our guests were equally impressed, and many commented on the unique and romantic atmosphere. Choosing Clearwell Castle was the best decision we made for our special day; it truly felt like a fairy-tale come to life."
V35,Clearwell Castle,"We had the perfect wedding at Clearwell Castle, their team were superb in providing planning assistance from the point of our booking, guidance on all aspects of our wedding choices from registrars and suppliers, and coordination on the day of the wedding to make sure it flowed seamlessly. It was a beautiful day, and we couldn't be happier with our choice of Wedding location."
V36,Inner Temple,We got married here in 2023. Everything was perfect and the team made sure the day/food etc was just as we wanted it. Particular thanks to Priya and Eva (Pegasus) for their hard work making our wedding day and lead up so special.
V37,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"I got married at Dodford Manor in February this year. A great time was had by all and I will be recommending the venue to any friends planning weddings.

The weather was bad on the day so we didn’t get to use the outside area very much, but it didn’t matter as the inside is so lovely.

Sky was really helpful and put me at ease on the day. Questions in the lead up and on the day were answered quickly and I was made to feel like the only bride in the world!"
V37,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford was the first venue we looked at shortly after we got engaged. The staff were friendly and relaxed when we had a tour, I knew it was the place for us! I think Lydia telling my now husband that we couldn’t have fireworks due to the animals nearby but we could have a fire performer outside, sold the deal for us! I got an amazing fire performer as a surprise for my husband and the guests after we had sparklers, and it just completed an amazing day!
We heard such positive things Dodford about how professional and smooth running weddings have been from our suppliers, and you guys didn’t disappoint. You handled the day so well, we didn’t worry about a thing and just enjoyed ourselves the whole day.
We honestly had so many lovely messages and conversations after our wedding about how the venue was amazing, everything and everyone was catered for, from my 88 year old Nan, to young children who could play and enjoy the outdoors with a scoop of amazing ice cream. We honestly couldn’t have asked for a better day, we would do it again in a heartbeat if we could! Thank you for making the day so seamless! We are eternally grateful to everyone at Dodford for making our dreams come true becoming Mr and Mrs Price!"
V37,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford Manor what an incredible venue, from initial enquiry to booking, Dodford and the staff were so accommodating and well organised. Nothing was ever too much trouble, even if emails were being sent at 11pm. The day itself, wow it was absolutely incredible, as our wedding was on a budget and due to small numbers Dodford were amazing at setting out our decorations, everything was absolutely perfect and a special shout out to Kayleigh who was amazing on our wedding day. She kept us on time, always checking we were okay and just such a lovely person and really made our day perfect. Would highly recommend a Dodford to any couple due to be married they make the planning and the day an absolute dream and we want to relive it over again."
V37,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"It goes without saying that Dodford is a fab venue.... stunning set up, well maintained, clean, perfect grounds etc... but the best thing about Dodford is the team! I had super high expectations of any wedding venue I booked as I used to run a wedding venue myself (potential nightmare client 😂).... from the 1st viewing the team were fantastic. Relaxed, stress free, organised, professional, knowledgeable, flexible but mostly importantly friendly which gave me complete confidence in them delivering my perfect day.
In the run up to the big day the team are super responsive on email and phone We didn't meet our Event Manager, Lydia, until the day but I was always confident that they work as a whole team and therefore having 1 point of contact was not necessary at all.
In the day Lydia was amazing! Still relaxed and professional and the whole day ran so smoothly. Every requirement was perfect, on time, delivered exceptionally.
We had the best day, thank you to the whole team (especially Lydia!)
Vic & Tony

V37,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We honestly can’t say thank you enough for how amazing Dodford Manor Barn was, along with all the incredible staff who helped make our day truly unforgettable.

From the moment we visited, we fell in love with the beautiful landscapes, open-plan barns, and stunning large windows that flooded the space with natural light. The venue package was one of the best we saw during our search—it felt like everything we could possibly need was covered.

The team at Dodford Manor Barn were incredibly friendly and supportive throughout the entire planning process. Communication was open and consistent, which made everything feel so much more manageable and stress-free. We were even able to find all of our wonderful vendors through Dodford Manor Barn, which was a huge bonus!

As a bride who suffers from anxiety, I was unwell on the morning of the wedding. But I have to give special thanks to Kayleigh and our vendors, who were absolutely amazing and supported me through every step—they helped me feel calm, cared for, and ready to enjoy the day.

Our guests couldn’t stop talking about how stunning the venue was and how lovely the food turned out. We were also lucky enough to have sunshine all day, topped off with a beautiful sunset in the evening—it truly felt magical.

Thank you again, Dodford Manor Barn, for being such a perfect place to start our next chapter.

With love,
Carter & Emmie (24.03.2025) x"
V37,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"From the moment we booked our wedding at Dodford Manor, we knew we were in good hands—but nothing could have prepared us for just how extraordinary the experience would be. Every single detail was handled with such precision, care, and genuine warmth that it truly felt like a dream come to life.

The venue itself is breathtaking, but what made our day unforgettable was the impeccable service. The entire team operated like a well-oiled machine, making sure everything ran smoothly while keeping the atmosphere joyful and stress-free. Their attention to detail was second to none—no request was too big or too small.

We want to give a heartfelt, special shoutout to *Lydia*, our incredible Wedding Manager. From our first meeting to the final dance, she was nothing short of amazing. Lydia went above and beyond at every turn—anticipating needs before we even voiced them, coordinating flawlessly with suppliers, and offering support with a calming confidence that put us completely at ease, (apart from making me cry the second I saw her! 😂). Her passion for what she does shone through in every interaction, and our day would not have been the same without her.

Thanks to this amazing venue and its phenomenal team (especially Lydia!), we were able to truly enjoy every moment of our wedding, knowing everything was in the best possible hands. If you're considering this venue for your big day—don’t hesitate. It’s everything you hope for, and more.

We want to do it over and over!
A day we will NEVER forget!!

Thank you again and all our Love,
Mr & Mr Pargeter-Prince
Rowan & Karl xx"
V37,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We booked Dodford Manor in Feb 2024 after we viewed the space, for our wedding in March 2025. It was the only venue we viewed, but instantly fell in love with the character and variety of spaces the venue had to offer. The free corkage also really appealed to us as a great way for us to bring our own drinks at a good cost.

From start to end, the team were amazing, helping us with the planning of the day and making sure we had a great array of suppliers we could work with. The live band was a huge part of our day, and Dodford have a great mixture of acts on their supplier list.

On the day of the wedding, the groomsmen arrived at the venue to help with set up to see that our amazing event manager, Kayleigh had every single aspect of the day in hand and sorted. She sorted all table settings, decor, stationary - Everything!! Nothing was too much to ask of her and the Dodford team. The day ran impeccably well, with everything being on time and everything we asked for being sorted. Our drinks were served chilled, on time and were always around. It’s easy for venues who offer free corkage to try and limit you drinking your own drink - Not here!! There was constantly beers being topped up, wine bottles replaced and aperol spritz being taken round. Cannot fault them!

The team packed all of our bits away and ready for us to collect the next morning. We are very aware Dodford is a busy venue and wanted to make sure we wasn’t just “another wedding” but at no point was that the case. We felt like we were the one and only wedding and genuinely could not ask for more!

Thank you so so much for everything, Highly recommended!!"
V37,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We got married her a month ago today and had the most amazing day with them. Jess, Jack and the team made sure that everything ran smoothly and that they were doing everything they could for us on the day. We would 100% recommend them for anyone wishing to marry in such a beautiful setting."
V37,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We had been apprehensive booking Dodford for our reception that it was so popular in Northamptonshire that our wedding could end up looking the same as a lot of others we knew of, as we're local - but that was a ridiculous thing to worry about! The level of flexibility/customisation you get with Dodford is unmatched in our opinion; as it's such a beautiful venue to start with, you don't have to work hard to make it look good before adding in your personality as a couple!

The whole process from enquiries to final planning and the execution on the day were great. We did have a slight issue with them not inviting us to a food tasting in enough time before our wedding date (whether they forgot/we were missed off a list we don't know) but when we did raise it they invited us to a tasting at their sister venue instead (it's 2 hours away but we were available to travel thankfully). Every member of staff we encountered in our experience with Dodford were so friendly and make you feel like you are the only couple that matters for them in that moment, which we really appreciated from such a popular/busy venue. Abbie was our Event Manager on the day and provided such an elevated level of service, nothing was too much trouble and she executed our plans/vision to a tee, adding in some extra details that we loved too.

Our wedding was in December 2024, and we only had our reception at Dodford, so the ceremony barn was set up for our drinks reception with plenty of space for guests without it feeling cramped or equally like we were all rattling around in there (we had 75 guests for our reception). They don't have many photos of indoor drinks receptions in their promo so I was a little worried how it would look but the team had it set up beautifully. We also had a brass band on the mezzanine level which was really fun and festive!

What sold Dodford for us was the no daytime corkage, which meant we could really personalise our drinks reception and wedding breakfast drinks without breaking the bank. There was a slight disconnect with how and when we had requested/planned to serve some of the drinks in our planning meeting and what happened on the day, which we think may have been a slight hiccup in communication between Dodford and Jenkinsons (the caterers), but it didn't have a negative impact on our day at all!

Overall, there's a reason this is such a popular venue - it is truly perfect!"
V37,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,Dodford manor is an amazing wedding venue. From the very beginning when we first stepped into the venue to look around we fell in love. We knew we had to have our wedding there. After booking the venue we had amazing contact with the staff from booking our food tasting session. To a general email to see how our wedding planning was going. The planning meeting was well organised and we were able to talk through exactly what we wanted and no want was too big for the team.
V38,Gosfield Hall,"I never imagined my wedding would be somewhere as stunning as Gosfield hall but from the minute we saw this venue we knew it was the one for us and didn't bother viewing anymore venues as we had already made our minds up about having our wedding here! We were absolutely blown away with the natural beauty of Gosfield hall and so booked two years in advance of our wedding day! The professionalism and advice we received from Linda was super helpful and informative on the run up to our wedding as there is soo much to think about! We loved that we could have our day and evening all in one place aswell as the option weather permitting to have our wedding ceremony outside. I'm pleased to say the weather was absolutely perfect on our wedding day and we got to have our fairytale wedding outside! The package we paid for was well worth the money! Our guests were absolutely spoilt on our day and have all said it was the best wedding they've ever been too! It was amazing to have our guests stay over aswell! Jocie our wedding planner was absolutely amazing! She was sooo friendly and super accommodating and went above and beyond on our day to make it absolutely perfect with no hiccups! She even helped dress me on the day as she knew how to do up a corset dress and my mother didn't have a clue lol she made all my wedding details and decorations come to life and done such a stunning job decorating our dream venue aswell as being super supportive towards me my family and guests! The honeymoon suite is the best we've ever seen and completely took ours and our guests breaths away! Mind blowing! The food,venue,grounds,accomodation and night before accomodation were absolutely stunning and we want to thank everyone at Gosfield hall for making our day soo incredible and special and a day we and our guests will never forget! We can't wait to return to Gosfield! Thank you everyone at Gosfield what an amazing place!"
V38,Gosfield Hall,"We had previously experienced Gosfield Hall as a guest before deciding on it for our anniversary.

Our day was beautiful and went according to plan. Our guests all had great feedback about the day.

The only thing we would have changed would have been more diverse menu for the main meals."
V38,Gosfield Hall,"Gosfield hall is a beautiful location for a wedding and their packages cover all the important stuff! We didn’t have to worry about caterers, wedding coordinator or a DJ - all included! Great service, lovely food and everyone really enjoyed the day! Our coordinator Jocie was fab on the day, getting everything organised and fetching anything we needed. Couldn’t have asked for better, she knew the time line and the day flowed really smoothly!"
V38,Gosfield Hall,"We got married at Gosfield Hall and everything about it was perfect from when we arrive to view it, booking, the communication and Faye Carter our wedding Coordinator! If you want the best wedding day with no hassle, Gosfield is your place!!"
V38,Gosfield Hall,"Myself and my Wife have just got married at Gosfield Hall,
Our expensive started when we viewed the venue and we first met Linda sales manager, she welcome us in & made us feel at home, we wasn’t sure how, but she made us feel calm like this was where we was meant to be.
Once we looked around at all the venue has to offer we had already made a decision as this is such a stunning location and instantly new this was what we wanted! It was just right for us.

We did not get made to feel pressured to make any decisions immediately however we did end up booking our big say within the next few days after our visit.

Our next contact was with Ellie our wedding planner, she was very helpful and nothing was ever to much, we enjoyed the food tasting at the venue and was very impressed with the experience, it was out of this world.
Ellie helped us through all of our problems and made sure all of our plans come to life.

Now on our big day, what can I say? The staff were amazing, Ellie couldn’t have done enough every time you wanted to ask a question she was next to us any time we needed something. She was there all the way through the day/ night & even the next morning, Ellie made our day Run seamlessly.
We’ve been to many weddings before but never have we had food as amazing as we did here.
Every guest was amazed at the food quality and commented on how delicious it was!
Just to sum up if you’re thinking about booking your wedding at Gosfield Hall don’t question it just book it. You will be amazed."
V38,Gosfield Hall,"The venue is stunning and was the perfect setting for our winter wedding (so much natural light even in January). Jocie Golbourn was our assigned wedding planning specialist and she is so kind, sweet, patient and professional. All our guests loved the venue but many actually commented on how flawless and seamless the day was organised and rooms decorated and prepared from each section of the wedding and we only have Jocie and venue staff to thank for their meticulous planning and preparations. The food and drinks were delicious. Couldn’t recommend this venue enough- we actually booked the venue on a whim and were SO happy when we visited for an open day. There’s no false advertisements- it’s stunning."
V38,Gosfield Hall,"Everything, from start to finish, was exactly what we wanted and more. The preparation was helped by our wonderful personal manager, Tara, and accommodated each and every one of our requests and needs. The venue is gorgeous, food delicious, and atmosphere felt special. Our friends and family all told us that this was such a spectacular wedding for them that it was the best they've ever been to. We felt completely taken care of, kept us calm and happy throughout the day, and kept all of our suppliers in place and to standard. It felt glamourous and unique. We wish we could relive the day over and over. It really was our dream wedding."
V38,Gosfield Hall,"We got married in Gosfield Hall in May and had the most amazing wedding day that any couple could ask for. The whole experience from the arrival the night before to leaving the day after was seamlessly managed by the team at the venue.
The house and the grounds looked absolutely stunning and Ellie and the team did a brilliant job at keeping the day running smoothly without making anyone feel rushed. Everyone there was immensely friendly and helpful and we really felt that everyone who worked there was invested in making our day feel special.
We fell in love with the venue when we booked it but the whole experience exceeded out expectations so much that we wish we could do it all again!"
V38,Gosfield Hall,"I wanted to take a moment to commend and state our appreciation for Jocie. She truly was phenomenal, approachable and no task was too big.
We had 5 months to plan our wedding and we loved every moment. With us both working in the service industry it was great to have someone who was so switched on and would be an asset to have on any team."
V38,Gosfield Hall,"Having just got married at Gosfield Hall I can honestly say it was the most beautiful venue and the most perfect day. The staff were so attentive and professional. The food was outstanding and the drinks and cocktails were fabulous. They couldn’t do enough to make sure our day was everything we’d dreamt of. I have to say a special thanks to Ellie - one of the wedding coordinators on site - she went above and beyond to help us plan our day and was there from the very moment I woke up delivering fresh pastries for breakfast to the moment she made me a cup of tea to go to bed with. I can’t thank you enough Ellie, you are an absolute credit to Gosfield Hall."
V39,Kingston Estate Totnes,"When I first enquired with Kingston I thought it would be too expensive but we explained what are budget was and when we wanted to get married and they put a quote together that was affordable.
We have just had the most amazing one day wedding which didn't finish until the early hours. We got married in the Long Barn where there are chandeliers running down the middle, it was very romantic. There is this nightclub at Kingston which is very cool which everyone loved. The guests all said the venue was stunning and the food was out of this world.
A few of us stayed the night before and most of our guests stayed the night of the wedding in the cottages and barns. The staff were brilliant and they coordinated the whole day for us. I cant recommend the venue enough."
V39,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had a two day wedding at the Kingston Estate. All our guests were completely blown away by it.
Most of our friends and family had traveled far for the weekend and were not disappointed when then arrived as the cottages and barns are gorgeous. Some even have hot tubs.
Jodie and the Weddings Team organised a welcome party for the first night which was unreal along with providing street style food for everyone around 8.30 pm. At Kingston they have this really cool enormous Yurt and food hut which is used the day before the wedding and for breakfast.
On the wedding day itself we got married in the Walled Garden and there were endless canapes during the drinks reception. We then decided to eat in the Hayloft Barn which has glass windows overlooking all the gardens.
We used the clear span marquee for our reception party and had the craziest cover band before we all went into the nightclub until 3 am. The good thing about Kingston is everything is included they let you use things like cake stands, easels, knifes, speakers, microphones, all furniture at no extra cost, they set everything up for you and then clean up afterwards. We didn]t have to do anything which made everything totally stress free.

Thank you Jodie, Ellie and Charlotte it was insane !!"
V39,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had the most magical wedding at Kingston. From the moment we set foot onto the grounds, we knew it was the perfect place for our special day. It was our first viewing… and nothing else compared for us (we saw a total of 6 venues). What stood out to us the most was the variety of spaces available for each part of the day. The selection of ceremony areas, the beautiful outdoor spots for photos, the yurt for the night before party, and a special one for us… the underground nightclub for the evening! As party lovers, this was a part that sold it for us; there was somewhere for every moment.

One of the things we loved most was the flexibility to personalize every aspect of our wedding. The venue truly felt like a blank canvas that we could transform into our dream setting, but equally, we got away with doing absolutely nothing as it was beautiful all on its own.

But what truly made our experience unforgettable was the incredible staff, led by Jodie. They were not only professional and attentive but also genuinely warm and welcoming. Their support and attention to detail ensured that everything ran smoothly, allowing us to relax and fully enjoy our day.

We're hoping to return and stay in the future, for a special occasion.

It's not just a wedding venue; it's a place that holds a special spot in our hearts as the backdrop to the beginning of our happily ever after 🤍"
V39,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Kingston was perfect. Despite a rainy start, the day was amazing and Jodie was available but subtly in the background allowing the day to be ours."
V39,Kingston Estate Totnes,"After over a two and a half year wait due to Covid, our son and his wife had a wonderful wedding weekend. Jodie from Kingston Estate and her team of staff went above and beyond to ensure the wedding ran smoothly. Every detail was dealt with professionally. The accommodation, venue and food were all excellent and all our guests many from overseas had a wonderful time. The only thing Jodie could not oversee was the weather but even a little rain didn't spoil the celebrations."
V39,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue and staff were brilliant from start to finish. The venue is really multi-functional and caters for rain or shine. The weather was really unpredictable around the time of our wedding but I was a stress free bride knowing they had it in hand. The food supplier was stunning - we had a weekend package which all the guests raved about. That coupled with the unlimited drinks pages made it the perfect venue for us. A Devon treasure that feels like being on a film set - everyone loved it!
V39,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Such a beautiful venue - we loved it so much. The food was incredible and despite having a changeover of wedding planner close to the wedding day, it had no impact on our day what so ever. The venue are calm and professional and loved their approach to communication which was friendly."
V39,Kingston Estate Totnes,Fell in love with the venue on our first visit. We were particularly looking for a venue which could cater us for 3 days and sleep the majority of the the guests. The grounds were well kept especially the walled garden which is where the ceremony took place. The team were a pleasure and made the day truly special.
V39,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Our 3-day wedding celebrations were spent at the STUNNING Kingston Estate - a truly unique venue that we absolutely fell in love with. It had EVERYTHING we were looking for & more. The grounds are perfectly manicured all year round & come complete with walled garden. The cottages & main house are beautifully decorated, providing luxurious accommodation for 86 of our guests. Sarah & the team were such a pleasure to work with & couldn’t do enough for us. The catering was also top notch. Thank you"
V39,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue was great we had a few personal health issues beforehand but the team went above and beyond to make the day extra special. The wedding planner organised everything for us and they had plenty of props on site that we were free to use. We had the whole place to ourselves for the weekend it was brilliant and our friends loved the hot tub and pool.
V40,Holmewood Hall,"We were married at Holmewood Hall on 15th February 2025 and I can honestly say that it was the most magical day. We went to visit the venue and instantly fell in love with it but even we were blown away by how beautiful everything looked on the day. All of the staff were amazing - special shoutout to our personal wedding manager, Laura Pike, who was always on hand to answer any questions - she couldn’t do enough for us! The food was wonderful & we had full control over the menu. Would highly recommend this venue, you won’t regret it!"
V40,Holmewood Hall,"Holmewood Hall was an absolutely perfect wedding venue. The house is stunning, well cared for and beautifully decorated. All of the staff are so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Our Wedding Coordinator was fantastic, available from early morning of the wedding and was still there the morning after working for us. The food was excellent, drinks and canapes were amazing and the venue took care of everything for us. We had the most perfect wedding and are so pleased we chose Holmewood Hall. The Gold Room where we had our ceremony is gorgeous. Thank you for giving us a beautiful wedding!"
V40,Holmewood Hall,"I cannot fault this venue at all, the venue itself is breathtakingly beautiful with magnificent rooms and very lovingly maintained grounds. The staff are incredibly friendly, professional and efficient, our wedding coordinator Lee was a pleasure to work with and made our special day run smoothly. If you want a hassle free wedding with breathtaking grounds and the most amazing staff then this is the venue for you."
V40,Holmewood Hall,"Had the most amazing wedding here recently and cannot recommend it enough.

The venue itself is stunning and the options included in the luxe package covered everything we could've possibly wanted and made planning the wedding 100x less stressful.

The staff were all amazing from start to finish, Katie showed us around initially and then Lee was our personal wedding manager, and they were both incredible throughout. Always on hand to answer any questions and help us through the day once we got there.
We had so many comments from our guests on how lovely the staff were on the day!

A particular highlight though was the food - the tasting evening was a dream and the chef went above and beyond to provide a full vegan menu for us which wasn't limited to only a couple of options.
Again, we had so many non-vegan guests complimenting the food and saying how lovely it was!

Overall, an incredible day and an incredible venue.
Thank you so much to everyone there!"
V40,Holmewood Hall,"This place is simply just amazing 🤩
We had our wedding here on 17-12-24 and it was everything we dreamed of and more. The food, staff, decor were just perfect not forgetting the most beautiful Christmas tree 😍
Our person wedding planner Lee was an absolute god send not just having him there on the day but always being at the end of a phone to answer any questions or worry’s.
If we could go back and do it all again we would and not change a single thing.
The most perfect day at the most perfect venue ♥️"
V40,Holmewood Hall,Perfect venue for a wedding with guest numbers 60 - 100. Our guests and I moved from each room to a new room throughout the day and every room had a new surprise. The bridal suite was lush and it was great having all our guests staying under one roof. I would 100% recommend this to anyone.
V40,Holmewood Hall,"The wedding day and lead up to the day were fab. However, for the price we paid, we expected a little bit more.
I opted to use the bridal cottage the evening before for which we paid £450 extra. This is something I now regret, as there was no hot water and we were not able to order any food in as all the take away options were shut (on a Friday night). The hot tub also needed a good clean. So the night before/morning of my wedding was not ideal. I flagged this to the manager who advised that we should have raised the cold water issue as soon as possible, but seeing as we were trying to have morning showers on the wedding day, this did not leave us any time.
Our package included pre-drinks, wine with dinner and we also purchased a cocktail ""cart"" (cocktails on a table) and a bucket of beers. The groom, who is not a wine fan, asked for a beer with his wedding meal and was presented with a contactless card machine to pay for it at the top table. We felt this was a bit unnecessary as there was a full bucket of extra beers outside and it felt a little embarrassing having a card machine presented to us at the top table on our wedding day for one measly Corona, despite the huge amount we had paid. Also, guests were unknowingly allowed to buy beers from the bar after the meal, despite there being available beers to them already in a bucket next to the bar...
Overall the wedding was lovely, but for the price we paid we expected a bit better. Essentially, I loved the venue, but I wish we had not purchased any extras!"
V40,Holmewood Hall,"We got married at Holmewood Hall on 4th October 2024. From the first moment we stepped into the venue and I saw the magnificent Gold room I knew this would be the perfect place for us to get married. We had the most amazing day which was perfectly coordinated by the whole team at Holmewood but especially so by our personal wedding manager Lee. Lee was always quick to respond to any questions we had in the lead up to the day and nothing was too much trouble for him.
We honestly wish we could do it all over again as it was a magical day. We would recommend Holmewood Hall to anyone looking for the perfect venue."
V40,Holmewood Hall,"After getting engaged in late March this year we wanted to get married fairly quickly so booked Holmewood for the same September. The venue, grounds, accomodation were all stunning and we felt very fortunate it was within budget and the package we got was outstanding in comparison to other venues and what it included, which was far far more than other venues. We got to attend a luxe event to choose all our wedding food, canapés, cocktails and wines which should have made things easier but due to the unbelievable quality it made it harder! Our wedding planner Lee is literally the most fantastic person. He was flexible, fun, engaged and on absolutely everything. The day was ran impeccably and also smooth even with some weather concerns and speeches taking a bit longe than we thought. If you book here ask for Lee!! We had the most perfect day. Can’t fault a single things. Our guests all told us how incredible everything was with one even saying he will now longer not attend any further weddings unless it’s at Holmewood. Thank you to all the staff and as mentioned a huge special thank you to Lee! Your a legend!"
V40,Holmewood Hall,"Exceptional venue, stunning grounds, fantastic DJ, and excellent service. Highly recommended! Happiest day of my life 😊"
V41,Bourton Hall,"We got married at Bourton Hall on 08 March 2025 and our wedding planner was Harminder. The day was absolutely amazing from start to finish. All the food and drinks were of a high standard and presented beautifully which includes the wedding breakfast, canapés and cocktails, and breakfast the next day. The venue is gorgeous with lots of rooms, well maintained grounds and exclusive use. The staff are friendly and accommodating and the event was really well managed. We would like to particularly thank Harminder, who was supportive throughout the wedding planning process and the wedding day, ensuring things ran smoothly and in a timely manner. He is a great communicator, provided advice and guidance where needed and attention to detail. We really had a magical day! Thank you so much! We would happily do it all over again and would definitely recommend this venue!"
V41,Bourton Hall,"What a fabulous wedding venue! Because it's a wedding venue and not a hotel that holds the occasional wedding, they really focused on what was important and anticipated our every need. It's an elegant venue but with a comfortable feel to it. The team are incredibly accommodating and helpful and each couple is allocated their own personal wedding manager to guide them through the process and to make sure every detail is covered.
There's a beautiful chapel on site where non-religious ceremonies can be held - this was fabulous.
The food was plentiful and delicious - all our guests raved about it. Great choice of welcome drinks and canapes, wines and cocktails.
The grounds are gorgeous; a perfect backdrop for our October wedding.
The venue was exclusively ours and has beautiful bedrooms, including a huge, stunning bridal suite. Most of our guests stayed overnight and took advantage of the brilliant breakfast in the morning so it really extended the celebration."
V41,Bourton Hall,"Our wedding at Bourton Hall was better than we ever imagined. The Italianate mansion is truly spectacular inside and out however it is the team that made our day run perfectly. Our guests found the setting and the food incredible, they were very impressed! Our wedding planner Emily Sarjant was fantastic her knowledge and expertise made our day magical from start to finish, with all the special touches that she suggested. Our first dance was created in such a beautiful way it will be a memory we cherish forever. Thank you to Emily and the team at Bourton Hall. My husband would also like to note that the croquembouche was amazing and everyone should have one."
V41,Bourton Hall,"My wife and I got married at Bourton Hall in September, with our wedding managed by the wonderful Eleni. Everything about the day went as perfectly as we could've wished, right from arrival to departure the following day. The venue is stunning, and the food was lovely, and having 21 bedrooms on site was such a bonus so that all of our close friends and family could stay on site with us.
Bourton Hall did everything they could both in the run up to the day and on the day itself to alleviate all stress to ensure everything ran as seamlessly as possible, which it absolutely did.
We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall enough."
V41,Bourton Hall,"We were married on 28th July 2024. What an amazing day we had at Bourton Hall. Could not fault it! The venue is so elegant! The grounds and views were to die for. The food was out of this world with so many choices and all cooked and served to perfection. Accommodation / rooms were plentiful and luxurious. Lovely to have a chapel on site too. We had the whole place to ourselves, we felt like royalty! Lots of varied rooms and areas for people to choose where they wanted to be after the wedding breakfast. We would choose the venue all over again!"
V41,Bourton Hall,"We had both our wedding ceremony and reception at Bourton Hall and the service was superb throughout. The house and grounds are beautiful with amazing views to go with them. The staff were professional and helpful during the lead up to our wedding day and during the day as well - even when we had an emergency prior to the ceremony which caused delays, the venue staff were able to work around this to move timings back in order to allow all of our planned activities to go ahead and be fully enjoyed. All the food was delicious and we had a wonderful wedding day thanks to Bourton Hall."
V41,Bourton Hall,"We had the most perfect wedding day at Bourton Hall. Throughout the planning process and on the day, the team were so professional, which meant we could relax and know that everything was in their capable hands - Emily was an amazing wedding manager. The building is beautiful inside and out, and the grounds are stunning - there are so many places for beautiful photos, and views out over the countryside. The food was absolutely delicious, it was so hard to choose what to have! It was also so helpful to have so many places for guests to sit and chat in the evening, away from the disco room but still part of the action. Having so many bedrooms onsite (not to mention a stunning bridal suite!) was an added bonus. We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall highly enough, and have had so many comments from guests saying what a beautiful, elegant but relaxed day it was, so I know they really appreciated everything Bourton has to offer too. Thank you so much to Emily and the whole team for giving us such a perfect day!"
V41,Bourton Hall,"As the Bride and Groom we were made to feel like nothing was too much to ask and they couldn't do enough to make us feel special.
All the guests commented that it was one of the prettiest and most relaxed weddings they have been to.
We could not have asked for a better wedding day thanks to Bourton!"
V41,Bourton Hall,"I had my wedding on 10/02/2024 I am so happy I chose this venue, It is really magical. My wedding manager was just the best! Emily went above and beyond to help me on my big day! I cannot thank her enough.

One of the main things about this venue is that t has its own chappel which is really special and makes you wedding seem more traditional, however there are more options/ rooms available. I wanted the wow factor and I got it.

Some of the options that made it great

*Onsite accommodation for night before and night of the wedding is really helpful
*Exclusive use
*Dedicated wedding manager definate gamechanger! (Emily)
*Menu choices are fantastic.

Everyone commented on the food being really nice ( we had the lamb) The evening buffet was also great. I paid extra to have a meal created as having part of my culture within the food at the wedding was very important to me, they did not disappoint.
Emily was perfect in so many ways, she knew exactly my vision once i explained it to her and she made sure that it became real for me. She adapted parts of the day so that it would work better, for example bringing the canapes outside whilst photos where being taken. Helping me into my dress, looking after my phone just everything I needed she was there. She really worked hard to make sure it run perfectly and it did.

Thank you emily!!! You made my day Great."
V41,Bourton Hall,We got married at Bourton Hall on 30th July 2023. It was the most amazing day ever! We are still receiving compliments from our guests on how stunning the venue was and the whole running of the day. This was 100% down to our wedding co-ordinator Harminder. He went above and beyond to ensure our day was absolutely perfect. He literally could not have done any more! Thank you again Harminder!!
V42,B&H Buildings,Bourne & Hollingsworth was such an exceptional venue for our wedding this September. This is the perfect place for you if you want a true London wedding that feels like a fun dinner/house party but on an epic scale. We used the top floor (the studios) for our sit down dinner (think candle light and tasty roast lamb) and headed downstairs for our reception with the basement club (below and hidden) for late night dancing. The place is stunning (greenery and glass everywhere and the cocktails are insane but what really makes this place are the people. The whole staff from Matt and Lizzie to the bar team to the dinner crew made our whole day seamless and so fun. Could not recommend B&H more highly for your London wedding.
V42,B&H Buildings,"Beautiful wedding celebration in the most stylish venue - we had an intimate wedding reception (drinks, dinner and more drinks!) at the Bourne & Hollingsworth Buildings. The staff members on duty were excellent - nothing was too much trouble and they served everyone with such professionalism. We couldn’t recommend it highly enough and we haven’t stopped talking about it since. All of our guests were so impressed with the space and how stylish it was. The bar, restaurant and greenhouse are all aesthetically beautiful and the botanical vibes make for a very relaxed, but premium setting. Special shout out to Lizzie who helped us coordinate everything and Matt on the day who led the team. Thank you so much - we had the best day and we couldn’t have wished to host it in a better venue."
V42,B&H Buildings,"India & the B&H team were seamless. Flexible, responsive, kind, and easy to deal with. They made our day so special. The food was fantastic, the drinks were lovely, and the value for money was first rate!"
V43,Leez Priory,"I never in my life thought I would get married in a place like Leez priory! The whole experience from start to finish was just fantastic. The price breakdown was manageable and there was no pressure to take any upgrades offered. The things we got in our package were phenomenal and having a wedding planner was tremendous - our lady (Leanne) was an absolute god send!
They catered to all our needs and we were made to feel so comfortable and nothing was a problem! I’d highly suggest going to an event there before hand, just to get a feel of what it’s like full of people and enjoy their delicious food. We actually enjoyed their entertainer ( singer) so much we hired him for our wedding ☺️
Lee priory is just so beautiful. I can’t speak highly enough x"
V43,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory on the 7th of September 2024. Considering how long they have been a wedding venue, they were pretty flexible with some of the ideas we had for the venue styling that turned out amazingly!

The staff really made the day something special and couldn't have done enough for us. Special mention must be made for Leanne, our wedding planner, who was amazing!

Highly recommend the venue and the incredible team that helped to make our day so special!"
V43,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in October 2024. This venue is stunning both inside and out with immaculately kept grounds and interior. The hospitality in the lead up to and on the day of the wedding was fantastic. The food was also brilliant. Another great perk of this venue is the amount of on site accommodation.

A couple of drawbacks / experiences during our wedding. There are only a few toilets in the main building which kept blocking and overflowing throughout the evening which led to us taking some guests to the dressing room or honeymoon cottage to use the facilities. You are also restricted by the venue on any external food or drink suppliers and the venues optional extras for this are quite expensive for what they are.

That asaide, we had the best day and evening at Leez Priory and would certainly recommend it!"
V43,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in August 2024- great venue and experience from initial viewing to leaving the morning after the wedding. Leanne acted as our wedding planner and was friendly, professional and helpful throughout. We opted for the classic package and the food was amazing quality with everyone commenting how full they were!
The venue is beautiful with several options for ceremony both inside and out. Accommodation was great too. The whole day ran smoothly with perfect weather - we will have very happy memories of our day!"
V43,Leez Priory,"Perfect venue and very attentive staff, lovely food and great communication from start to finish"
V43,Leez Priory,"Stunning venue. Fantastic Team. Very accommodating toward our unique ""surprise"" strategy. Our guests were truly surprised. Thank you."
V43,Leez Priory,"Leez priory was the 1st and only venue we looked around when we started planning our wedding. From the moment we stepped on the premises, everything just looked so perfect and exactly what we wanted from a wedding venue. When we got assigned our wedding co-ordinator Rachel, she was just absolutely spot on with everything we asked for and nothing was too big an ask for her. She made sure the day ran as smoothly as possible and took care of any issue that arose without me knowing (which I am forever grateful for!!)
The rest of the staff were amazing and very helpful.

The venue itself is just absolutely stunning and we loved that it has the pub area as well as the dance floor so it catered to all of our guests.

All of the rooms were lovely and it was so nice being able to stay in the fisherman’s lodge onsite the night before the wedding.

We genuinely cannot recommend this venue enough and it was 100% worth the money! 10/10!"
V43,Leez Priory,"We got married on a Tuesday in October to maximise the value of what we could get for our money; and honestly, we got everything we wanted and more. Leanne, our Wedding Manager was perfect at bringing an attention to detail and seamless organisation to the big day, and in the lead up. There wasn't one moment of the day where we felt stressed, as Leanne had it covered. In one particular instance, our flowers for the bridal party's hair hadn't arrived. Within five minutes of telling Leanne that we needed this, the flowers were with our hair and make-up suppliers to add the finishing touches.

Leez Priory as a venue is the most stunning setting, and offers an incredible range of areas in which the ceremony and reception can take place. There is also the opportunity for the bridal party to make use of the Fisherman's Cottage the night before the wedding, and for people to stay in the on-site accommodation on the evening of the wedding, making it the perfect venue for people also travelling from further afield.

Leez Priory were very accommodating, welcoming and were happy to work with us to make our day as perfect as possible. The food was incredible, and a total hit with all of our guests, and so many people have commented on how incredible the day was as a whole. You wouldn't be disappointed to choose Leez Priory."
V43,Leez Priory,They catered to our every need. To when we would ask for things they hadn’t been done before they still made sure it went smoothly. Leanne was amazing she made me feel so comfortable from the start. The whole day was stunning. Beautiful venue please go view it as you will not be disappointed
V43,Leez Priory,We got married on the 26 May 2024. This venue was absolutely brilliant! They catered for every need and made sure there was no stress on the day. Leanne was kind and level headed throughout and was always one step ahead! Do not hesitate to book- do it now!
V44,London Rowing Club,"We picked this place because we wanted somewhere fairly central and casual. We fell in love with the long room and the view. Our wedding was in October so we thought we'd have it cosy but we ended up with a beautiful autumnal day so everyone was on the balcony. The fairy lights were perfect and the other rooms were great to avoid leaving. The staff was so friendly and accommodating that we would definitely recommend the venue.

The only thing that could have tainted the day is that after three visits and many emails, we were never told that the river floods (a lot). We were flexible with our day so if we knew this we would have built it into our day, instead, I was told by the photographer on the day as I got out of the taxi that we wouldn't be able to take any group photos because the area would be flooded during the cocktail hour and half that we had assigned as photo time. This would have been disappointing but we all ended up running outside after the ceremony to take photos before the tide came in. My husband and I borrowed wellies for our couple photos. We had fun doing this, but I can imagine many couples being upset! My friend's electric car also flooded and they were obviously upset."
V44,London Rowing Club,"Annabel was meticulous in her help planning the wedding. Very knowledgeable and helpful.
On the day the rest of the staff were brilliant - there wasn’t an empty glass in the house.
Great venue at a reasonable price on the London riverside."
V44,London Rowing Club,"LRC was the perfect place to celebrate our wedding this summer. The venue staff went above and beyond to ensure that everything went as planned both before and during the event. Thanks in particular to Annabel who was responsive, helpful and always put us at ease in the build up. The location is stunning - couldn’t have asked for a better day!"
V44,London Rowing Club,"We just wanted to say an enormous thank you for everything. From the moment we came to visit the LRC on a slightly grey January weekend, we knew it would be a fabulous venue for our June wedding reception and it certainly did not disappoint. It really is the most beautiful setting and we have very fond memories of our guests enjoying drinks in the sunshine with the most fantastic view over the Thames. The venue has such character and lends itself beautifully to a wedding reception. We have received so many compliments from our guests and I would encourage anyone thinking about booking their wedding at the LRC to do it, you will not regret it! We were lucky to be blessed with beautiful weather so were able to have our jazz musicians play on the balcony for the drinks reception before moving into the Long Room for our meal. It looked stunning with the tables dressed and mantles adorned with flowers. Following the meal and speeches, guests enjoyed drinks back on the balcony and in the Fairburn and Members Rooms which provide plenty of seating, whilst the Long Room was cleared and the band set up. We then partied the night away.

From start to finish, the organisation was so straight forward. Annabel was very accommodating and full of helpful advice in the run up. I knew that on the day she would ensure things ran like clock work, which of course they did. Our suppliers also commented on how helpful the LRC team were to work with. On the day the staff were brilliant and went out of their way to ensure everything ran smoothly (including borrowing some large gym fans from the rowers to put in the Long Room to keep us cool as it was an unexpectedly hot day). We really can’t thank you enough and now need to think of an excuse to host another party with you in the future!"
V44,London Rowing Club,"We got married in St. Mary's church and then had our reception in the London Rowing Club in February 2023. It far exceeded our expectations and was an incredible fabulous stress-free day with thanks to the wonderful Annabel making the day just run.

In the lead up to the event, Annabel was incredibly responsive, helpful and helped us plan the day exactly how we wanted it. She answered all our questions really quickly, always got back to us, was very flexible with what we could do and allowing us to personalise the space. Prior to the event, Annabel arranged for us to go and have a look around on a couple of additional occasions to help us plan how we would want it to look. She also gave our caterers a tour of the kitchens as they were new to the venue.

In the immediate lead up to the day, Annabel helped with our suppliers in getting chairs delivered and bringing all the wine over a day earlier. On the day, she helped to make the day flow and just dealt with things throughout the day.

The venue itself is beautiful with three rooms to use. A middle reception room, a cosy snug and the main long room. In the main long room, there is a rowing boat hanging upside down with fairly lights. The main lighting can be dimmed and gave a wonderful atmosphere for the evening meal. As our wedding was a winter wedding, it was fairly chilly so they lit fires in the main room and snug which added to the atmosphere.

We had around 90 guests - could have fitted a few more just about. We used the round tables, tablecloths, linen, plates cutlery and glasses provided and they were perfect for a wedding and looked very smart. No need to hire these. As mentioned, we did hire separate wedding chairs instead of the conference chairs provided. There's a lot of decoration in the way of rowing memorabilia on the walls which means you don't have to actually do too much to make it interesting for guests.

Overall, the perfect London wedding venue with absolutely fabulous views across the Thames with a long balcony to enjoy from. To top it off Annabel is truly amazing and so helpful."
V44,London Rowing Club,"We had our wedding (ceremony+reception) at LRC in July, and the venue itself and the team we worked with were absolutely incredible! Everything on the day went without a hitch and we heard so many compliments on the location - our guests loved the balcony and the layout inside, which included plenty of space for anyone wanting a break from dancing to sit down and relax. Would recommend to anyone looking to host an event!"
V44,London Rowing Club,"London Rowing Club is a truly fantastic venue and we were both so delighted with how our day went! The venue has real character with the classic rowing memorabilia and it’s location on the Thames, and looks amazing when it’s all set up. The layout and size of rooms I thought were perfect for our wedding of about 70 (+15ish more in the evenings) and of course the big attraction is the balcony which all of our guests adored!! (I wish I’d had more time during the day to stand out there and enjoy it 😂). Not only is it a fantastic venue in a great location but what really made this the most amazing venue was how great all of the staff, and all the recommend suppliers were! The day exceeded expectations and we got compliments on the place and the staff from all our guests. Couldn’t be happier with the venue, it was perfect for us!!"
V44,London Rowing Club,"We found the London Rowing Club while desperately combing through London locations after our original venue fell through a few months before the day.
Luckily for us it was available due to a cancellation - kismet!
From the start the charming Annabel put us very much at ease and helped us to envisage the day as we hoped it would be. She was very flexible and helpful throughout the planning process.
We were incredibly lucky with the weather on the day and the venue really came into its own - it was virtually impossible to get guests off the terrace, which is the perfect size for our smallish event (65 people) and of course offers gorgeous river views.
We were well looked after by the team and everything went off without a hitch. The interior of the space itself is lovely with a great sense of history.
Nice additional touch - table tennis was made available in the entry room for the later part of the evening!

It's a special place and I'd thoroughly recommend for anyone seeking a memorable spot to tie the knot!"
V44,London Rowing Club,"We got married at the London Rowing Club on a brilliantly sunny winter day on Saturday. All the way through in the run up (after 2 years or more of postponements), Annabel and team bent over backwards to help us arrange everything, recommended some brilliant suppliers for food (Shona Pollock comes highly recommended) and flowers (same with Steph the charityflorist.)

So many of our guests said how lovely the venue and staff were on the day, and the whole place looked a million dollars with an amazing photo set on and around the balcony and river - although we haven't seen those yet. The corkage and bar tariff prices are also incredibly reasonable for an inner London location!

I can't recommend the LRC highly enough. It will live in memory for a very long time."
V44,London Rowing Club,"The London Rowing Club team alongside the Dinner Ladies went above and beyond to ensure that we had the wedding perfectly fitting our requirements. Throughout the entire all of the suppliers worked seamlessly together to ensure the space transformed as we progressively added guests and transitioned between eating, our ceremony, more eating, music and dancing. We wouldn’t have had it any other way. The attention to detail of the team is second to none - perfect for any bride and groom seeking a beautiful event."
V45,The Prince Albert,"The team at The Prince Albert were always accommodating, made everything easy and stress-free, and helped us organise an amazing wedding party. They really knew what they were doing, and helped guide us through the process calmly, working around our schedule (which wasn't easy - we live abroad!) to make sure all our last-minute worries and concerns were sorted smoothly. The food was excellent, and the space was fantastic for our party. Can't recommend it highly enough!"
V45,The Prince Albert,"We had such a happy wedding with Harrison and this venue. Harrison was really flexible and answered any questions we had and made great suggestions when we needed seating arrangements, the schedule for the day, a florist, and more. The day was accessible to everyone and the food and drink were perfect. Thank you for making out wedding stress free and wonderful."
V45,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert was the most wonderful venue for our London wedding. We came across the venue at there wedding fair and chose alot of our suppliers from the same wedding fair.

Harrison and Lauren were always so on hand to help with any questions and did a fantastic job answering all of our questions. The staff were so friendly and helpful and made everything run like clockwork.

We couldn’t recommend The Prince Albert enough for a london wedding and would love to do it all again."
V45,The Prince Albert,"My wife and I were beyond happy with how everything went on our wedding day. Harrison, Diana, Claudio and the whole team were absolutely phenomenal! It was such a beautifully efficient operation, and we always felt like someone was there to help us when needed.

We've had dozens of compliments about the great food and how wonderfully intimate the venue was for a wedding. Some of our more traditional relatives said they were initially sceptical at the prospect of a pub wedding, but that it was one of the most beautiful and joyful weddings they’d been to. A friend of mine was also very happy that someone at the bar remembered her drink order throughout the evening! On top of that, everything ran perfectly to schedule, which is no doubt down to the high attention to detail.

It was very useful that the upstairs was free on Friday afternoon so that we could set up the space. It gave us plenty of time to do the flower arrangements, put up the bunting, and stick photos on the frame wall.

Thank you again so much for all the help and support you've given us - it really was the best day of our lives (so far)!"
V45,The Prince Albert,"My husband and I got married here in late September 2023, and I cannot recommend the Prince Albert enough!! Booking a wedding venue can be stressful and we felt like a lot of the venues we looked at gave us the ""hard sell"" but the folks at the Prince Albert helped to put us at ease every step of the way. We fell in love with how beautiful the pub was, so hired the upstairs for the ceremony, wedding breakfast and party afterwards for around 40 - 45 people. We were able to drop off decorations the night before and talk it all through with the staff, and they did such a good job of working with us and the florist to get the place looking amazing. The ceremony went off without a hitch, everybody loved the food and we had a blast in the evening. All the staff were amazing, but special shout out to Harrison and Lauren for helping us plan and run the day, and Maria for managing everything on the ground both when we dropped off the decorations and during the wedding itself. Thank you again for helping us celebrate our special day with our loved ones, for making it so stress free and so memorable!"
V45,The Prince Albert,"All you ever hear about wedding venues is that everything is a rip off, the food is meh, and there are a ton of annoying restrictions...the opposite is true of Harrison and The Prince Albert team. From Day 1, Harrison made the whole process not only easy but really fun! He was quick to respond, super knowledgeable, and very accommodating; he even helped our best man execute a surprise for us without it disrupting any timings. On the day, they decorated the place beautifully, managed to serve a 3 course dinner to 76 people unbelievably fast, and everyone raved about the food - to say they did a good job is a gross understatement, they went above and beyond. We were after ""classy fun"" and that's exactly what we got - thank you so so much!"
V45,The Prince Albert,"We had the exact wedding reception we wanted at the Prince Albert thanks to Harrison, Claudio and the other amazing staff who helped us feel so relaxed in the build up and during. We wanted a very low-key vibe and the team understood that but there were enough options for any style of wedding you wanted. The upstairs function room felt cozy and intimate while still leaving breathing room and space to dance, but you could easily rent the whole place if you wanted more guests and even choose to do your ceremony there. We had the most compliments on our food (we chose a buffet option). The team were particularly accomodating to some complicated dietary requirements and it was all delicious."
V45,The Prince Albert,"July 6, 2023 was the most memorable day of our lives! A big thank you to Harrison and the rest of the team for assisting us through out the whole process. Our guests loved the Prince Albert pub especially the sumptuous food and booze on our wedding day!

David & Dannah"
V45,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert is a Great venue for the classic Pub Wedding.
Harrison and the team did an amazing job to organize everything. The food was great and the service first class. Only sorry it was over so quickly. Thanks again for everything."
V45,The Prince Albert,"We found The Prince Albert when our original venue cancelled on us less than 2 months before our wedding. & we are so glad we did; everything happens for a reason! From the moment we met Harrison, we knew we were in safe hands, and the team at the Prince Albert made our day amazing. The pub looked beautiful and we were very greatful for the effort the team put in putting up all our decorations. We had so many compliments about the food, and we were very impressed in the swift and organised manner in whichever it was served. Everyone had a wonderful time, and we would not hesitate in recommending The Prince Albert."
V46,Kindred,"We chose Kindred for our 60 person wedding and it could not have been better. We wanted a venue where we could have the ceremony, dinner and dancing all under one roof, that was wheelchair accessible, and easy to get to on the tube, Kindred ticks all those boxes and more!
The food is incredible, we really enjoyed popping by to do all the tastings, we'll continue to come to the Cellar for food and cocktails. Many guests commented on how good the food was.
The place itself is gorgeous, inside and out. We used the whole venue, the main Hall for the ceremony, dinner and dancing, and the Library upstairs for the drinks reception and cake cutting. Also, being right next to Hammersmith station, the venue could not be easier to get to!
The staff are wonderfully attentive and helpful, both before and on the day. They were really open to the little details that made our day uniquely ours, from the drinks selections, to having a table and glasses on stage for the ceremony, to playing our music selections at the right time. Plus its a dog friendly venue!"
V46,Kindred,"We LOVE this venue! We got married here with only 12 weeks notice and Anna, the owner, and her staff went above and beyond to make the day as memorable, magical, and marvellous as we'd hoped it would be. The venue is elegant, stylish and perfect for a London, city based wedding. The food is sensational as it comes from their in-house kitchen on the ground floor and every guest remarked on how delicious their meal was. It's restaurant quality food, not your standard wedding food. The place looks stunning in all our wedding photos and the wedding cake they made us (at very short notice I might add!) was second to none. Everyone loved it. The venue was also perfect for late night dancing and drinking and merriment. It was such a pleasure - and a breeze - to work with Anna and her team on one of the most important days of my life, and I very much hope to do so again in the future. I will forever be grateful to her and all she helped us with."
V46,Kindred,"We had our wedding reception for 35 guests at Kindred, in the Library and Salon earlier this year. The day went incredibly smoothly, the staff couldn't have been more attentive and our guests raved about the food for weeks afterwards. It was the perfect sized space for our intimate celebration, really cosy and the atmosphere was great. The little touches really helped to make the day special, with espresso martinis served for the speeches and sparklers for our exit at the end of the night. Thanks again to the lovely Kindred team!"
V46,Kindred,"I cannot find a single fault in our experience with Kindred for our wedding. Not only was it a stunning venue that honestly made some of our guests gasp as they arrived, but Anna and the team were so incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. Having them support us really took so much of the wedding planning stress away and we knew we were in safe hands. I really appreciated that the team were happy to chat through ideas with me and were always keen to find creative solutions to give us the day that we had envisioned.

The food was absolutely delicious and they were so accommodating for our long list of dietary requirements from our guest. The cocktails were also so delicious. Our guests were buzzing for weeks after, as were we.

On the night, the staff were not only incredibly helpful and efficient, but also just so friendly, welcoming and complimentary. We felt thoroughly spoilt and very well looked after.

We visited so many venues and this was by far the best choice for us. The interiors made for some stunning photos and the layout of the spacing meant that whilst we had 80-100 guests, it still felt very intimate. I cannot recommend Kindred enough!"
V46,Kindred,"We would give a thousand stars if we could. Kindred hosted us for our cocktail style wedding and it was everything we could have hoped for and the perfect venue for this style of wedding. The wine, cocktails and food (incredible grazing board, canapés, bowls and pizzas) were exceptional and the team were on top of everything, friendly and nothing was ever an issue. We would HIGHLY recommend it. We have had loads of guests message us to tell us what a spectacular venue it was with the most friendly team. The venue had different spaces to suit our needs and the AV is amazing - it worked perfectly for our live music band and our DJ, and our own music playlists for our ceremony. They took the stress off planning and really did mean we could relax and not worry that everything would run smoothly. Thank you so much Kindred team for giving us the best day of our lives"
V47,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The best day of our lives and me and my now husband couldn't be more thankful to Bredenbury. Before booking Bredenbury we visited over 17 wedding venues in Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Herefordshire - we fell in love instantly, there is no need for a crazy amount of extra expense on decorations, the venue speaks for itself. The fact that it was no corkage just added to why we wanted to book and the team were so friendly. In the lead up to the wedding they were brilliant, we booked far in advance and brought over all our family members to come see the venue, they were so flexible, understanding and welcoming - they couldn't do enough for us. On the wedding day they had decorated for us by the time we had arrived and all we had to do on the day was to enjoy it - which was perfect. It really was the best day of our lives, all the comments from our family and friends was how beautiful the venue was. They kept the day running so smooth and we didn't need to think about a thing."
V47,Bredenbury Court Barns,"There truly aren't words to describe how incredible Bredenbury Court Barns and their entire team of fantastic staff were through the planning process and the day itself. They were so friendly, supportive and nothing was ever too much. From quick replies to any questions that popped to mind to planning meetings that left us feeling prepared and ready to the day being set up beyond perfectly. Our amazing wedding coordinator Lianna spent the days and months (years really!) leading up to our big day making sure everyone detail was perfect, that everything was incorporated that we'd dreamed of and made sure we didn't feel a moment of stress from start to finish. All throughout the building from the bridal booth, to the orangery to the oak barn was beautifully light and open - even with our wedding being the end of October - and we had so many compliments about this! There aren't enough words to say thank you and explain just how much we'd recommend this venue to everyone"
V47,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We had the perfect day back in July. The weather didn't go to plan but they helped make the day so special even with the last minute switches because of the rain. We had such an amazing day and the feedback from our guests about the venue, food and service was great! We cannot thank the team enough for the effort they put in throughout the whole process but especially on the day. We felt incredibly supported throughout the whole process."
V47,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The venue itself is stunning. The buildings, grounds and interior decorations are all beautiful and immaculately presented. From the moment you turn down the lane it is so picturesque, you know you've found somewhere special. It's exactly what we were imagining for our wedding venue.

The layout is perfect, with ample space for guests to mingle and move about, and great accessibility for older and disabled guests. Ours was a winter wedding, and while most of the day was inside it wasn't cramped and we could still enjoy the beautiful grounds through the expansive windows that run along the whole barn.

All of the venue is stunning, but practicality-wise the Bridal Suite warrants a special mention. Room length mirrors, plenty of room for the bridal party to get ready, have their makeup and hair done, and if there's time to relax as well. Drinks were served from 11 onwards, and it has it's own toilets and shower.

From our first meeting at Bredenbury the staff were exceptional. They gave a reassuring air of professionalism and experience, with just the right level of excitedness for our day without it feeling forced. We were really impressed by how responsive the whole team were, with speedy replies to any questions we had during the planning. This is something we particularly appreciated as we only gave ourselves 7 weeks to plan our big day.

Value for money wise it felt tricky to gauge when we were trying to choose a venue as the headline figure is rarely what you'll end up paying, with different venues charging different amounts for different things. Not the case with Bredenbury. With their No Corkage policy and generosity in being able to use whatever props they already have, any extras were non-essentials of our own choosing.

No Corkage is pretty significant. Some venues wanted to charge £20/bottle, so not having to pay this and being able to supply not only our own wine but beers, gin and soft drinks for the drinks reception and wedding breakfast was not only a massive saving but also made the occasion more personal for us. The bar staff and catering team were excellent, pouring and serving drinks, warming our mulled wine and setting up the gin bar. Once your guests have drunk you dry the venue's bar is well stocked and standard pub pricing.

We wanted a Christmas wedding and seeing in early November that they had a date available that December we couldn't resist. 7 weeks isn't long to organise a wedding with nearly 100 guests, and we couldn't have done it without the Bredenbury team being so organised. Our assigned event manager, Harriet, was brilliant in the runup and on the day, as were all the other managers and staff we spoke with. The Wedding Bible they fill out with you is a great idea and nails down all the finer details to ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible on the day.

We didn't want to have to spend the day before and morning of our wedding worrying about set up and decorations, but needn't have worried as Bredenbury did all of this for us. A meeting beforehand clarified what we wanted where; we simply dropped off boxes of stuff the day before and rocked up in the morning to find everything laid out as hoped.

This organisation extended to the third party suppliers, of which Bredenbury have an extensive list of local recommendations. We booked the ceiling lights with Cotswold Wedding Co. and didn't have to do anything else. The band, Apollo Gold (incredible!!) set up without any hassle and didn't have any issues with Bredenbury's noise limiter. Our florist Katrina Bevis hadn't been there before, but again had no problem getting everything in place on the morning.

On-site accommodation was good for close family and friends, but there's not enough for the majority of guests and the lack of a dedicated honeymoon suite is a bit of a shame. If you want privacy for your first night as a married couple it means taking over an entire lodge. The quality and comfort of the rooms is excellent, though, and the continental breakfast served the morning after in the East Lodge was delicious, with ample options for Vegan and Gluten Free.

Jenkinsons are the exclusive caterer for Bredenbury and have an extensive menu for nibbles, the wedding breakfast and dinner. The menu and ordering process is clear, and pricing is what we expected to pay. Food and service was as slick and faff-free as everything else. A real delight.

On the day, Harriet and the catering manager were absolute superstars. Zero stress, everything ran to time and as planned, and they were always available if we had any questions or needed help.

The whole day was perfect and exactly what we wanted. I don't think we could have achieved this without the exceptional organisation of Harriet and the team. The entire process was very slick, zero stress, and we wouldn't hesitate in recommending Bredenbury Court Barns to anyone looking to get married in a countryside paradise."
V47,Bredenbury Court Barns,"I want to say a massive thank you to Bredenbury Court Barns for hosting our wedding. From the start they were super amazing and accommodating to us. They won us over with their care and support even when we had a pickle in the beginning.

Olivia was super helpful from the start and throughout the year we were planning she offered huge amount of support and suggestions.

We typed in “orangery weddings” in google when we were first looking because I was keen to get a ceremony in an orangery and Bredenbury popped up after much searching. Once we saw the Orangery we cancelled every other viewing we had across the country because we felt we found the perfect place, and nothing compared to the reception with the beautiful windows that brought all the light in. The grounds were absolutely spectacular and gorgeous. It was a no brainer for us to pick such a beautiful venue. They brought my ideas to life and we were able to get support on anything from recommendation of suppliers, to ideas on decor to their favourite meals from Jenkinson’s. They fully outdid themselves in love for us. We can’t forget it.

Our wedding day was exceptional with Lianna helping us all the way. She was a breath of fresh air. She cared about all the little details and made us feel relaxed and had a good laugh with us. The fact she was there 100% of the way, before the wedding, during the wedding, and even after is unmatched! Thank you Lianna for really being there to make our wedding day smooth and relaxing.

The food was incredible too and we often think about how sad it is that we didn’t finish our second plates, we think about it a lot.

Thank you for the wonderful journey BCB, you blew us away with your integrity, kindness, and genuine support!"
V47,Bredenbury Court Barns,thank you to everyone at bredenbury court barns who made our day so special
V47,Bredenbury Court Barns,"From the moment we stepped foot into Bredenbury Court Barns, we knew this was the venue for us. It was the first and only venue we viewed as we were blown away by how gorgeous the venue is. The venue itself is absolutely stunning, with breathtaking views and impeccably maintained grounds that set the perfect backdrop for our special day.

The staff went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. From our first consultation to the last dance, their professionalism and attention to detail were exceptional. Harriet was absolutely brilliant and I don’t know what we would have done without her!

The food was another highlight—our guests are still talking about how delicious everything was! Jenkinsons are amazing, they helped us personalise our menu perfectly!

We couldn’t have asked for a more beautiful venue to have our wedding. The day couldn’t have been more perfect! Thank you to everyone at Bredenbury Court Barns for making our wedding day nothing short of magical!"
V47,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We could not have had a more perfect experience with Bredenbury Court Barns. Right from initial booking all the way through to breakfast the following morning, everything was perfect. Nothing was too much trouble for our wonderful planner, Lianna. She ensured the day ran smoothly and our months of planning turned out exactly as we’d imagined. They are available to answer any questions you have any time, they’re only an email away and get back to you so fast. The venue itself if just gorgeous, the grounds make for some wonderful photos, and the orangery lets so much light in that your ceremony photos are gorgeous. The whole place is fully air conditioned too which was great for our July wedding. The bridal suite is a perfect balance of being aesthetically pleasing and practical for getting ready in, it’s so spacious, lots of natural light, there’s plenty of plug sockets and huge mirrors so everyone has plenty of room for getting ready and no one is on top of eachother. There’s even an outside space for getting some fresh air. I’m so glad we chose to have our wedding here, it’s given us memories to cherish forever and there are zero memories of any stress!! Cannot recommend this venue enough!"
V47,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We cannot believe how lucky we fell to get married at such a beautiful venue. Right from the offset of viewing the venue, to our special day, we were taken of. No question was too silly, and so much pressure was taken off us during the planning. We managed to make everything our own and Lianna was there every step of the way. Thank you for giving us our happily ever after. We will forever be grateful."
V47,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We loved our wedding at Bredenbury the team did an amazing job providing everything we asked for and more. We especially liked that our wedding coordinator for the day, Harriet had thought of everything for us she went above and beyond and even offered to go and get my mum some more shoes when hers broke! absolute 5-star service and the food was amazing too!"

V49,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow what can I say, Brinsop is an absolutely stunning wedding venue with heaps of character and so many options of places for the ceremony and to do things. We fell in love with it as soon as we saw it and knew it was where we wanted to get married.

Right from the start, the Brinsop team were so helpful and accommodating. From giving an virtual tour then showing us around in person, Issy and the team were fantastic right the way through. Nothing was a hassle, no request too difficult and they were incredibly professional and responsive throughout the whole process.

We loved that Brinsop is an exclusive venue with accommodation on site so we could stay with the bridal party and our immediate family. All the rooms are unique and have so much character and it's fun exploring the whole place. You feel like you are in the middle of nowhere, in nature with swans, ducks and birds all around.

Throughout our planning process, Issy and the team helped us every step of the way, being incredibly flexible in managing our requests and really trying to create our vision. They even got their team to make a giant jenga that we could use on the day! They helped to create the most perfect bespoke wedding breakfast and canapes menu, and seemed so positive and excited to be part of our special day and experience.

Arriving at the venue, Issy and the team were ready and had everything prepared and ready to go. It made the process so smooth for us and meant we could really enjoy the day without any stress. Issy coordinated perfectly with all of our vendors and it really felt like she and the whole team were so happy for us and wanted to be part of our day which was amazing. Our guests commented on how friendly and responsive all the staff were and it really made the experience extra special.

I wouldn't change anything about the day and it was perfect. I would absolutely recommend Brinsop as a wedding venue and all the staff who are really invested in helping deliver your vision. Thank you so so much to the whole team for making this a day that we will look back on for many years to come with amazing memories."
V49,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow, what a perfect day we had! It really went without a hitch and that was thanks to Nina and all the staff at Brinsop. The team worked seamlessly to ensure the day was as perfect as could be, and it really was! The wedding was booked over 2 years in advance and the staff were so accommodating with all my questions, planning and site visits, they couldn’t do more to support us. Special thanks to our coordinator Nina who was a delight to work with and a credit to Brinsop. Everyone that attended agreed at how beautiful the venue and grounds were, it was a wedding people won’t forget! 10/10 would recommend to anyone!"
V49,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"It's taken me quite a while to get round to writing this review, because sadly it's quite a bittersweet one.

We were married last year on 15 June and Brinsop was our chosen venue for both our ceremony and reception. We were first attracted to brinsop by the accomodation, meaning our loved ones could stay on-site, especially my grandparents which was so important to me.

The home itself is absolutely beautiful, including ivy cottage which myself and my mum stayed in the night before the big day. It really was a picture perfect setting, and looking down from the bridal suite seeing the ceremony space being set up on the Wordsworth lawn was honestly magical. Id dreamed of an outdoor wedding on that lawn, and we were so grateful the weather cleared so we could have it. The team really did wait till the latest they could to ask us to make a call on an inside or outside wedding (despite being June, it was a gloomy day to start) which I really appreciated!

Another amazing part of hiring brinsop was the after hours space we were able to enjoy until 2am with our house guests. The games room was absolute fantastic and meant that if you wanted to go to bed you could, but you could also stay up, party and play pool. I really do think this was a highlight for our guests and would recommend massively if you can spare some budget.

On the night of the wedding, myself and my new husband actually stayed in one glamping tents which we absolutely loved. The groundsman was on site until we were ready to leave the games room, and he then took us up to our tent in one of the buggies, making sure we had plenty of blankets and even stopping off for some bottles of water for us. This was really special, and can't thank him enough.

Hugo Spritz!! Having hugos at both our welcome drinks and drinks reception after the ceremony was amazing. I'm not a fan of prosecco myself and Mark and the team made it possible for us to have Hugo's all round. We even sneaked some up to the bridal suite to have before the ceremony (thanks Nadia!). Our guests loved them, and the amount of people that have told me they now need them at their own wedding is crazy!

Onto the not so good - sadly it all started to go a little downhill when we moved things into the knot barn for our wedding breakfast. Sitting on the top table, I could see that guests at the top of the second rows of long tables didn't really even have a seat around the table and were just kind of plonked on. The seating plan hadn't been followed, and I don't think there were even enough tables laid for the service to be comfortable for people because there was a dance floor at the end of the barn (which I did not ask for).

It was quickly also brought to my attention, that one of our guests had had to put her child on her lap in order to remove the high chair so people had more space. We also lost about 5 napkins with them setting on fire from the candles because everything was just way too cramped.

I asked to speak to catering, and asked if there was anything that they could do. I was told 'well sure, if you want the whole thing to be late'. In truth I shouldn't have even had to broach this myself, as it should have been sorted by the coordination team.

The tables weren't changed, even after they'd said they'd sort after the first course and yet the whole meal still ran late. We've had so much feedback about people not having enough food, food not being easy to access on the sharing platters etc and honestly when you've waited so long for a day and had spent 25k on the venue and food alone, it really has been heartbreaking to hear. I do sometimes question why people still bring it up (even now, people talk about the dining) when it clearly upset me so much.

Whilst writing this review my husband asked my what we had for evening food - we didn't get any. It was left unannounced on a back table. I don't know what I was expecting, just not that.

The next morning, the houseguests were asked to come down to breakfast for 9am (it was on a note in the room) but as we were in the glamping area, we walked past the knot barn just before 8.30 and the food was already out. We ran down to the house to hurry everyone up, and by which time everyone arrived it had been sitting there for 20plus mins going cold.

My biggest upset was that when I fed all of the above back to brinsop, feeling pretty deflated about the catering, I was told they'd pass my feedback on and heard absolutely nothing back. 25k total with over 10k on food and drinks to hear absolutely nothing, and this was 9 months ago. I'm not saying this in would happen to anyone else, but really - it shouldn't have happened to us either."
V49,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our wedding! From start to finish, everything at Brinsop was flawless. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most magical backdrop for our special day. Our guests were blown away by the beautiful venue, the warm atmosphere, and the seamless coordination. Every detail was taken care of, and we felt so well looked after. The team was incredible, professional, friendly, and attentive. On the day itself, they ensured everything ran smoothly, allowing us to truly enjoy every moment. A special mention goes to our amazing wedding coordinator Nina!"
V49,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We had our wedding on New Year's Eve 2024 at Brinsop, and it was more perfect that we could have ever hoped for. The venue itself is stunning, with beautiful spacious rooms which slept over 40 of our guests. Our coordinator, Nina, was incredible and so supportive on the day - she kept everything running so smoothly and everything went by without a glitch. The food and drink managers Mark and Amy did the most incredible job - nothing was ever too much, they were so attentive, and the chefs the most stunning meal after we gave them a fairly vague brief of 'curry'! We had the most perfect day and we're so incredibly grateful to Brinsop and the team."
V49,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,Brinsop Court is pure magic—an unforgettable venue with an incredible team!
V49,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We were lucky enough to have our wedding at Brinsop Court in December, and it was an absolutely spectacular day. We fell in love with Brinsop as soon we set our eyes on the beautiful manor and surrounding gardens. Cate, Amy, Mark and the rest of the wonderful staff at Brinsop really go the extra mile to make you feel special, and are extremely flexible with requests in order to make your day feel more special. We honestly felt like there was no request too big leading up to the day and they really made us feel extremely comfortable leading up to the day.
On the day, Cate and her team were well on hand to help us with setting up everything and she had everything under control when there were a few hiccups. The day itself was absolutely magical, and that wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for everyone at Brinsop working extremely hard to ensure that everything went to plan and as smoothly as it could.
Thank you to everyone at Brinsop for making us feel at ease and ensuring that our wedding was an amazing day."
V49,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Brinsop, the perfect wedding venue! We got married at Brinsop in December and I can honestly say it was everything we could have hoped for and more. We found out about the venue through Hitched and was one of only two venues that we visited but as soon as we got the house we knew it was the one. We fell in love with everything about it and it was fair to say that our guests agreed with us with many saying it was the nicest venue they’d been to. We had the wonderful Nina as our coordinator and she was brilliant! Nothing was too much trouble and we had constant communication with her in the build up which helped our stress levels no end. The same can be said for all of the staff who were brilliant throughout and allowed us to have the best day of our lives with everything running seamlessly. A special mention must be given to Amy and the catering staff who put on such an incredible menu (including the tasting session that provided some of the best food we’d ever had) and ensured that the food has been one of the main things that people have mentioned to us since the wedding! We had our ceremony in the Banqueting Hall which provided the perfect setting, especially with it being a winter wedding, as it really added to the cosy atmosphere and the lounge areas/games room were perfect for the drink’s reception. We would have loved to have also had it in the courtyard, but the temperatures meant that the lounge with the fireplace was a far more appealing option on the day. We then had the wedding breakfast and reception in the knot barn which was decorated beautifully and was the perfect place for the party in the evening. Overall we really can’t thank everyone at Brinsop enough for making our day what it was, we can honestly say that we have been made to feel part of the family and already can’t wait to hopefully come back to stay in one of the cottages for our first anniversary!"
V49,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Where do I start!!
Brinop Court is the most stunning venue, it was the first venue we visited and instantly fell in love! Theres so much history to the house and we were treated like family every time we visited before the wedding and it literally felt like home the whole weekend of the wedding, my guests also agreed!!

A special thank you to Issy our coodinator who went above and beyond ti make sure everything was perfect for us. It was so easy to plan and nothing was too much to ask, even arranging our dog to be our ring bearer!! When they say Brinsop is dog friendly they really mean it!!!

What a place, what a day!! Thank you so much everyone, you all made our day perfect and it really was the best day of our lives♥️"
V49,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We got married at the gorgeous Brinsop in October this year. It’s hard to put into words how amazing the whole experience was. We honestly had the best day of our lives!!!

We fell in love with Brinsop during our first visit back in December 2022. We knew almost immediately that Brinsop was the venue we were looking for! From the outside the venue looked like a painting - from the picturesque views of the countryside, to the swans swimming on the moat! The manor house itself has so much character, and has a lovely homely feel to it as you walk around it. Our guests were equally blown away by the venue!

A big thing for us was that it’s dog friendly, which meant we could have our two dogs join us on our special day, it wouldn’t have been the same without them there! They had so much fun walking around the grounds and greeting all of our guests!

Nina, our coordinator, and her team were always available to answer any of our questions in the run up to the day. This really put us at ease, knowing we were in safe hands. On the day, Nina and the team made sure everything ran smoothly and went above and beyond to ensure our guests were looked after. A shout out to Amy who heads up catering and Mark who manages the bar. The food and drinks were absolutely fantastic!

I highly recommend this venue! There’s a reason Brinsop is an award winning venue - and when you visit it’s not hard to see why. We are already looking forward to going back there for a date night next year! Thanks for everything Team Brinsop!

V50,The Manor at Bickley,"The Manor is the perfect venue for weddings! When our wedding venue fell through 4 months before the big day, I stumbled onto the Manor at Bickley and spoke to Craig. He was most helpful and kind and went above and beyond to make sure our wedding went ahead.

We hired the venue for our two day wedding and the staff were helpful and accommodating from start to finish. All of our guests were awed by the beautiful well kept grounds and the excellent service. We can’t thank the staff enough for making our wedding dreams a reality. They thought of every detail from bringing us champagne after our civil ceremony to making sure we had our card box at the end of the night! We are excited to head back to celebrate our anniversary there!"
V50,The Manor at Bickley,"Myself and my Husband chose this venue for our wedding last week and we can’t sing The Manor’s praises enough. From our very first enquiry, to the first viewing of the venue, right though until the big day, the staff at the manor have been nothing short of brilliant! Each staff member we came across was polite and accommodating. Special mention to Craig and Vicky with whom we did most of our liaising throughout the months leading up until our wedding. Craig and Vicky were super helpful, responsive and went above and beyond to make sure that we could have the day of our dreams. Even with last minute changes due to the weather, Craig who was just incredible throughout, managed to help us sort a backup plan so our day would still go ahead seamlessly.

The rooms at the manor were spacious and modern, giving us and our wedding party lots of space for photographers and videographers to capture the special moments on our wedding morning.

The lodge that was used for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready was fabulous. The manor was very flexible in giving us early access so we could get ready on time.

The grand marquee was definitely grand! Very spacious and when decorated looked like something out of a fairytale! lots of kitchen space, a huge bar and fantastic overhead speakers for the party!

The manor was super flexible to our needs regarding access, start times, outsourcing our vendors and much more. The venue is beautiful and spacious with options for outdoor and indoor events and entertainment. The grounds were absolutely beautiful, so many lovely spots for photos not only for us as the bride and groom but for guests too!

A very special thank you to our point of contact throughout, Craig. From our first meeting, he was charming, bubbly and made us feel super welcome. He reassured us that he has experience in African/Caribbean weddings and that our wedding day would amazing and it was. He was attentive and always let us know that he was only a phone call or e-mail away and was always quick to respond and answer any questions we had.

All in all, we had the most beautiful day at The manor and we would definitely recommend this venue for a wedding or other events.

V50,The Manor at Bickley,"We hired The Manor at Bickley for my daughters wedding. Got a brilliant service from the venue. Everything was set accordingly, as per floor plan. Our guests were loved the venue grounds/facilities and the overall wedding set up.
Thank you to everyone at Bickley."
V50,The Manor at Bickley,"A warm and friendly service from the very helpful staff, a feeling that it is your own house! The food was amazing and the atmosphere made us and our guests feel fantastic."
V51,Davenport House,We are so pleased we chose Davenport House for our wedding reception. Charley and the team were so helpful and thoughtful. Putting canapés behind the bar for us and making sure everything ran so smoothly. I am obsessed with the stunning house and grounds and it was absolutely perfect! Thank you so much for making our day so special!!
V51,Davenport House,"Davenport House is a STUNNING wedding venue so how could we not have it for our big day!?

The staff were exceptional! From the moment we booked through to our big day, we had an absolute blast and could not thank each member of staff enough! Special shout out to Jared (hopefully spelt right, haha!) who made sure we were fed, watered and ensured we took 5 minutes to ourselves every moment we could - Also even saved us slices of pie wedding cake before we went to bed!

Our guests have said they have never been to a wedding so spectacular, with the most amazing food and amazing staff so could not have been happier having Davenport as our venue! 🩷"
V51,Davenport House,"I just wanted to write to say a huge, enormous thank you to Charley and all the team at Davenport House. We still can’t believe how perfect our day was, and lots of our guests have told us it’s the best wedding they’ve ever been to. The team were all a huge part of making that happen. It was incredibly seamless and well planned on the day, meaning we genuinely didn’t have to think about a thing, except for enjoying ourselves. The day ran to schedule perfectly and even certain touches we didn’t know or expect to happen were planned by you and the team, which made the day even more special. Thank you so much for giving us our dream wedding day. We can’t wait to see the full set of pictures and the video now to relive it all!"
V51,Davenport House,"Without doubt the best day of our lives. From start to finish, Davenport has exceeded expectations. From the very first impression of the venue during the open day, the incredible food tasting evening, all the way through to the day itself, including the support and preparation leading up to it. It was really important to us to pick a venue that not only ticked the fairytale box, but also come with the complete support of a wedding planner, due to our busy jobs. We were lucky enough to have Charley as ours. She really took the time to listen and get to know us, to ensure the day was tailored to exactly what we wanted. We even had our own cocktail designed, which went down an absolute storm on the day! She considered every little detail, constantly putting our minds at ease, which made the whole process so easy and enjoyable. Honestly the day couldn’t have gone smoother, any anxiety or stress faded immediately as soon as we got to the venue. It was simply perfect. So many of our guests were complimentary of just how beautiful the venue is and just how well organised the day was, and that is the perfect way to summarise Davenport. Any prospective couples thinking of selecting Davenport as their venue, hesitate no further. It will be a day you never knew was possible! We cannot thank you enough Charley and the Davenport team, if only we could live the day over and over again"
V51,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was amazing. When looking for a venue we weren't just looking for something wow, we needed to have people who were enthused and passionate about their work - we found that at Davenport House.

From our first phone call & meeting with Lizzie and Tallulah, we knew this was the place for us. Having two brides wasn’t an issue; combining British, Asian and Spanish cultures - wasn't an issue; having brides enter together – wasn’t an issue. Nothing was an issue. At Davenport House, we got it all – a picturesque venue and the best team of staff anyone could ever wish for. All our external suppliers have commented what a fantastic venue you are. All out guests have said that the service and attention to detail was second to none. The thoughtful touches like hiring a Spanish speaking waiter for the table which spoke very little English ensured that everyone felt welcomed. Guests with dietary requirements didn't feel they got a second rate meal or they were an afterthought - the food for all throughout the day was exceptional. The rooms / cottages where our guests and we stayed, spotless and comfortable. The thought behind adding some cheese and Spanish ham to the morning breakfast - so sweet!

Special shout out to Megan - wedding planner extraordinaire who kept in touch throughout the planning process and was exceptional on the day. Ian who worked tirelessly to ensure the day ran smoothly and the food was perfect, Charley who was also in charge of one bride and ensuring that everything was on point. All the staff were fantastic - polite, professional and personal.

Everyone keeps saying that this was the best wedding they have ever attended and that’s a lot of weddings between people! When we asked why, they say things like ‘the venue’, ‘the staff’, but it all came back to the inclusivity, love & joy that they felt – and you were all a part of that.

Davenport House is a stunning venue made even better by those who work there. If you want the whole package on your wedding day, we strongly recommend you book them.

Thank you to the entire Davenport House team.

Sat and Ana xx"
V51,Davenport House,"Where to begin with our beautiful venue and thanking the people who made it all happen! We got married in November at Davenport House and it was easily the best day of our lives. We chose Davenport because we wanted to host our cosy winter wedding in a big grand house in the country, with all the grandeur and class but to still feel like an intimate celebration with our family and closest friends, and it was perfect in delivering just that. It is utterly beautiful, the location was perfect and exactly what we wanted. The food was absolutely AMAZING, we had so many compliments from our guests and we are so grateful for the team in delivering such a fabulous wedding breakfast. Thank you so much to Lizzie who couldn’t do more to help us have our dream day, and Ian who delivered the best service to us and our guests (the pizza at 2am was very much appreciated)

Massive massive thank you to Charley our wedding planner, who was so so helpful throughout our wedding planning process and on the day, I can’t thank her enough. She was always there whenever I needed her, helped me so much with creating our dream day and I will be forever grateful to her for keeping me sane! Whenever I had any worries I knew she was just a phone call away, which helped me a lot when planning a wedding!

Charley, Lizzie and Ian thank you for everything - best team ever. Our day was seamless and it was all down to you and your incredible team.

Jess and Sam xx"
V51,Davenport House,"Me and my (now) wife chose Davenport House as our wedding venue in mid 2022, to get married in September 2023, and it was the best decision we could have made. We looked at a range of Georgian style manor house type venues located in Cheshire, North Wales and the West Midlands areas. It blew all of the competition away in terms of the venue aesthetics, the balance in design (i.e. period characteristics vs modern design), the impressive condition of the property for its age plus what it offered for our wedding weekend.

Staff and service - In the UK, this is usually something that is average at best - if you're lucky. At Davenport House, the service from all staff was 10/10. I honestly don't think we've ever had better service for anything. We had a wedding planner from the start (Megan), who was an absolute saint and was fundamental in making the whole wedding a success. She was also instrumental in helping us find a way for our 'little' dog Bernie to be a part of the main event. Thanks Megan!

Accommodation - The fantastic condition, design and decor for Davenport House extends to all areas of the estate. The rooms are fantastic, very big, well maintained and cleaned religiously by the venue. We had no issues or problems from all of the guests who stayed onsite over the 3 days.

Food and drink - This got a lot of deserved praise from the guests too. We got to tailor our entire menu and it worked perfectly for what we wanted for the 3 days. The oyster bar and luxurious charcuterie board went down particularly well the day before the wedding.

I could keep writing much, much more on how fantastic this venue was for our wedding. But the best advice I could give for any interested couples is to go and visit it in person and reach out to Davenport House with any questions. Our own wedding ended up becoming both perfect and the best wedding we've ever been to. Thanks guys again!"
V51,Davenport House,"Fantastic location.
Great staff.
Beautiful place to get married.
I can wait to film here again soon thanks for having me."
V51,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was a fairytale, everything we could have dreamed of and more. Lizzie and Charley were fantastic in their support, organisation and professionalism in planning our wedding. The venue is simply spectacular- breathtaking. Our guests were blown away. The day ran so smoothly it was simply perfect. The food was out of this world our guests couldn't get enough. All the staff at the house went above and beyond to ensure we were happy and having a great day. The team were also extremely supportive of last minute changes/additions. The Davenport experience was truly wonderful and I'm sad to see it end right from our initial meetings, food tasting and finally our special day. Thank you: Lizzie, Charley, Ian and all of the team for a truly memorable day for us and our guests. Mr and Mrs Kissane"
V51,Davenport House,"We got married at Davenport House in February and they provided us with the most perfect day. Lizzie, Charley, Ian and the rest of the team were the best hosts we could have hoped for. Nothing was too much to ask and the guests all commented on the hospitality shown to them. The setting is utterly gorgeous, our weather was less than favourable so we did not make the most of the grounds but this didn't matter, the house was setting enough and so atmospheric! The food was utterly AMAZING and better than most restaurant food I have eaten. The venue feels intimate and grand at the same time.
I literally cannot recommend this place enough, they gave us the wedding we had always wanted and more!"

V53,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge on 12 May 2023 and it was incredible. The views are gorgeous and the photo opportunities are endless with beautiful floral and green surroundings. The team were super responsive throughout the process which is really reassuring and helpful when planning a wedding, and Nelson who ran the day was just fantastic. Every single detail was thought of and they run a really slick operation. This is essential as it meant I had a lot less to think about! They put me and my partner at ease throughout. The food and service on the day was fantastic, so many of our guests said this was the best food they’ve ever had at a wedding. Highly recommend! (Photos by Costa Weddings UK)"
V53,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","Pembroke where super helpful and provided a lot of guidance in helpful forms and layouts. Always available for a call and very helpful. on the day, it ran super smooth and and staff where lovely. Thank yo for making it a great day!"
V53,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge in October 2024. The whole day was magical, including the beautiful view over the autumn trees in Richmond Park. Robert made sure everything ran perfectly and helped us to find slots in the busy wedding timetable to fit in some special moments to also reflect traditions from my husband's Dutch culture. The food was great and the staff were polite and fun. All preparation with Lucy was also smooth and done with a smile. The Pembroke Lodge team ooze experience but make every wedding feel special and really listen to your wishes for the day. Highly recommend! Thank you to the whole Pembroke Lodge team, especially Robert, Lucy, the kitchen team and the staff on the day!"
V53,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park",The staff has been very helpful. They have a lot of experience. Open to any suggestions and help in critical situations.
V53,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue than Pembroke Lodge for our summer wedding. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most gorgeous backdrop for our special day. A huge thank you to our banqueting manager, Nelson, who went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly.

The team was incredibly supportive and accommodating throughout the planning process, making it an enjoyable and stress-free experience. Their professionalism and attention to detail made all the difference, and we’re so grateful for everything they did to make our day unforgettable. Highly recommend!"
V53,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We got married on the 3rd of October this year, and the team made our day magical! What a smooth day. We loved every second of it! The guests loved everything, and raved about the food and organisation.
Hiring Pembroke Lodge was easy. We had a viewing where all information was shared in detail and super clear to understand and make a decision.
On the months leading up to the big day our contact was Alice. Alice is a star. Responsive, professional, and had answers and solutions to everything.
On the day, Nelson coordinated the whole thing, minute by minute, and we are forever grateful for his politeness, professionalism and high spirits. We felt safe and in good hands. I would give Pembroke Lodge way over 5 stars if I could :)"
V53,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","My wedding went without a hitch, thanks to the amazing team at Pembroke Lodge (special thanks to Nicola & Robert)! They made sure everything was set up perfectly on the day, exactly in the way we had requested, and then ensured the day itself went as smoothly as we could've hoped. Everything looked beautiful and the stunning views made all of our guests fall in love with the venue too."
V53,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had the most perfect day. The team have all been so responsive and accommodating of our every request. The venue is beautiful and we were lucky to have gorgeous sunset views. It is truly a countryside wedding but conveniently close to London, which was important for our overseas guests. The food was fantastic and staff were professional and efficient. Would recommend to anyone."
V53,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We recently had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge, and I cannot say enough good things about the venue, the team and manager, Robert. From the moment we started planning to the big day itself, he was absolutely incredible.

Robert went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. He was always available to answer our questions, offer solutions, and provide creative suggestions that enhanced our vision. He coordinated effortlessly with our vendors, making sure everyone was on the same page, which took so much stress off our shoulders.

On the day of the wedding, he was a true rockstar! He made sure the timeline flowed perfectly, from setting up the ceremony space to ensuring the reception transitions were seamless. His dedication and hands-on approach allowed us to enjoy every moment without worrying about a single thing.

Our wedding was a dream come true, and we owe so much of that to him and the team! Thank you, for everything you all did to make our day magical."
V53,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We could not have wished for a better wedding venue for our special day! Everyone went above and beyond to make sure our day goes perfectly without us having to worry about a single thing! A big shoutout to Nelson who was absolutely brilliant and made the day feel so calm and well thought through.

The food was delicious and all the team was so welcoming and super helpful on the day.

Thank you so much, we really really appreciate all the help!"
V54,The Hackney,"If you are having a wedding for under 60 people then this is your place! From start to finish the communication and planning of the wedding was seamless and took so much of the stress out of the day. The totally customisable packages that they offer really does suit anyone’s budget and more importantly regardless of what package you end up going for it is value for money. The food was delicious and it catered to everyone’s tastes including a pregnant guest, halal, vegan and lactose intolerant and was the talking point for our guests. The venue itself is stunning! Lots of exposed brick, they had recently redecorated before our wedding and the reception room that doubled up as the dance floor was styled simply but made a statement and the outdoor covered patio area was a welcome addition. The team understood our vision from the get go and they completely nailed it, all of our guests couldn’t believe it was here! I honestly can’t recommend it enough if you’re wanting a small and intimate wedding venue but still with all the class. I would say to future couples even if you think this wouldn’t be your venue please please do have a proper look because it will change your mind, I had come across this venue multiple times over the course of a year and decided to take a leap of faith and give it a chance and we’re so happy we did."
V54,The Hackney,"We can’t recommend the Hackney highly enough. They made the whole process so easy and they offer so much in-house which we took advantage of. The food was especially great - our guests were amazed “best food I’ve ever had at a wedding” and the team took great care of us during the planning stages.

They offer a very customisable service with scalable pricing. If you’re having a fairly small wedding (under 60) then you must check out The Hackney.

We had such a perfect day and we owe so much of that to the fabulous venue. Beautiful space, so professionally run."
V54,The Hackney,"We had such a brilliant experience working with the team at The Hackney. We were regularly in touch throughout the planning process and the use of the shared spreadsheet was especially handy for keeping everyone informed.
We had to postpone our wedding two days before as we were both sick with COVID, and the team were just fantastic. They waited for us to recover and then we started to talk through options again. We were able to rebook just six months after our original date, and the team were accomodating and understanding throughout the process.
The day itself was perfect. Lots of our guests commented on the quality and quantity of the food and Hugo was great at keeping everything to time. We wish we could do it all again."
V54,The Hackney,"We had our wedding reception here and wow was it amazing. Hugo, Erika and the whole team were amazing. Every single guest commented on how delicious and plentiful the food was. The staff were amazing nothing was too much to ask and all so happy.
The venue itself was decorated amazingly, given we left our wedding stationary etc up to the venue it exceeded our expectations. I was concerned about the allowed decibel level for Dj / entertainment but it was plenty loud enough. I wish I could relive the day again, if you’re thinking about booking The Hackney do it! You will not regret!"
V54,The Hackney,"We held our wedding reception at The Hackney in July and it was truly the best experience. We opted for a standing reception for our 65 guests, serving food bowl-style for a more relaxed, less formal feel. The food was absolutely delicious and there was lots of it - it just kept coming! Our guests are still raving about how good the food was months later! Lots of good drinks options too - we especially like the cocktails here!

The staff on the night were so friendly, welcoming and were amazing with our children guests too!

The Hackney is such an aesthetic venue with exposed brick walls and existing foliage which we loved, so we kept additional decorations to a minimum. We dropped our decorations to The Hackney the day before and picked them up the day after, which was super easy! We hadn’t given them too much direction with where we wanted everything placed but when we turned up to the venue on the day it was truly perfect! The staff know exactly what they’re doing and had decorated it beautifully! The outdoor seating area is a great feature too (especially for our two greyhounds who chilled out there for the majority of the reception!)

We opted for a simple Spotify playlist for our music and their sound system was good.

The wedding planning process was super easy from start to finish, with continued support and check-ins from Hugo, from the moment we booked, to the day itself! We really enjoyed the menu tasting experience earlier in the year too, which is a great touch in the build up to the big day! The planning spreadsheet was easy to use and made us feel content and relaxed, knowing that everything was under control.

Overall, we would highly recommend The Hackney to anyone looking for an affordable, dog-friendly, wedding reception venue with a laidback vibe, delicious food and lovely friendly staff! We look forward to coming back every year to celebrate our anniversary, with an espresso martini!"
V54,The Hackney,"We hosted our wedding reception with the team at the hackney in May 2023. The planning experience was straight forward and easy to book. The availability for the venue is on the website so easy to see when they have and get it booked. We went with the 5 canapés, bowl food menu, and drinks on arrival with wine through the event. The staff were brilliant and food delicious.

We loved the vibe of the venue as we wanted a bit more of a casual event, with a relaxed feel and we were able to host our 85 guests with no issues (although limited to standing event at this size, there is enough scattered seating for anyone to sit when they wanted).

In terms of decorating, we didn't feel the need to add any extra flowers as the venue was already so made up with plants and other decorations.

We did add the photo box which I highly recommend, was great fun for our friends and family and came with a memory book. People were shy at first but really got into it. We also used the recommended baker who provided a delicious cake.

Final area to mention - pricing. Wedding venues can be really expensive and daunting before you even start paying for any food or drink. Something that really attracted us to this venue was the low spacing cost and the minimum spend with it. It meant that we were able to completely customise the experience and see where the money we were spending was going. There are many different options and packages to go with, so it's up to you.

Only thing that wasn't offered was any tasting of the food beforehand which we would've liked to have done but none the less, the food was delicious so it wasn't really needed!

To finish, we loved every moment of it and hope that many others get to experience the same. Thank you very much team at the hackney!"
V54,The Hackney,"We had our reception in July. The venue was cosy and comfortably fit 30 people without feeling too crowded or too empty (we were worried it might be too empty). We managed to fit a band in, arranged mini-golf in the venue after dinner, and customize the cocktail menu with custom recipe (that we provided before hand).

One of the biggest highlights was the food. The crispy roast pork got so many complements and indeed it was tasty. But really, all the dishes were amazing (we had a tasting session prior), it was hard to choose, but the taste of each dish was still top notch on the day itself too. I heard that the supper snacks we ordered were great too but alas, I was too busy and they were snapped up instantly!

Some other details:
* We were allowed to use the small room downstairs as a private space to put our stuff. Very handy to not mess up items.
* We went with a bar tab and kept increasing the budget each time till the end of the night instead of the all-you-can-drink. From our rough calculations, it worked out about the same going for all-you-can-drink. Of course, certain folk were heavy weights and more than made it up will be different for each crowd.
* Lighting for photos came out excellent (combination of photographer and venue lighting).
* You can adjust air conditioning to suit the weather (we had ours on the warm side due to older folk not dealing with cold too well).
* Outdoor space was a pleasant change in atmosphere for those who wanted some fresh air.

What about the review from the Bride? Bride approved this review."
V54,The Hackney,"The day was fabulous - Hugo was brilliant and flexible with what we were after. The tasting day before was such a great idea and the whole experience and guidance given made planning a wedding in c.5 months so much easier. We had vegans, last minute drop outs, ridiculously hot weather, about 3 different spotify playlists, a string quartet, florists arriving in the morning and a cake that arrived the day before - the team took it all in their stride and it seemed like a breeze. Loved it all and we've had such good feedback from guests. A fabulous whirlwind.

Two very minor points for feedback - we maxed out the guest numbers (the team did advise us against it but were very accommodating despite us also throwing musicians into the mix) and it was a little too crowded pre-lunch on such a hot day. We also put some speeches in between courses (again, we were recommended against it) and that may have been a slight mistake for the dessert timings, as the tasting day was 10/10. But, it was a perfect day in a stunning venue. Loved it - thank you guys."
V54,The Hackney,"Jon and the team were absolute superstars, hosting the perfect wedding day for us. The space is beautiful, the decor is modern and perfect. They were so accommodating for any request or question we had which we really appreciated. Guests commented on how great the cocktails were! The day ran so smoothly and we had a fantastic time."
V54,The Hackney,"From the initial phonecall to the warm welcome we got when we first visited The Hackney, we knew we were in safe hands and that we’d made the perfect choice. The venue offers the most beautiful interiors - the perfect mix of cosy, intimate and modern industrial - exactly what we were looking for!

Our entire experience with The Hackney was an absolute dream -we loved the mega organised approach to planning. Something that could have been incredibly intimidating was made so straightforward with the amazing support of Hugo the General Manager who embraced all our weird and wonderful suggestions and gave expert advice on what we could do to make things even better. We left every meeting buzzing with ideas and even more excited to welcome our closest friends and family to the big day.

The quality of the food and drinks is impeccable - every single one of our guests (even the fussiest!) has commented on how much they loved it. We absolutely loved the menu tasting, even though it made the decision even harder as everything was amazing. What makes it even better for us is living close by and being able to pop into our wedding venue for a coffee or a cocktail!

I couldn't recommend The Hackney enough - I just wish we could go back and do it all again!"
V55,PYRÁ,"We held our wedding reception at Pyra. We booked the entire venue, with the upstairs loft serving as a dance floor with bar and downstairs having tables and seating for guests.  Canapes were served upstairs and a buffet dinner was served downstairs.  We lucked out with great April weather, so guests were also able to enjoy Pyra’s patio and additional space on Lonsdale Road. We were very happy with our decision to have our reception at Pyra, and many of our guests commented on how lovely the space was, how nice the staff were, and how delicious the food was.
 
The venue:
The space is gorgeous with lots of natural light upstairs.  Guests arrived at 4pm but we had the venue for the entire day, and Pyra gave our florist access earlier to set up beautiful flower arrangements and candles - it looked stunning.  Pyra set up our welcome sign and card box too. The venue also accepted delivery of our cake on the morning of the wedding which was a huge help, set it up very nicely upstairs, and cut it for us after the formal “cake cutting” shots.  We were able to coordinate with Pyra ahead of time to arrange the space how we wanted, such as how many tables we wanted downstairs and the set-up of the loft upstairs.  They even had a microphone ready for us upstairs so we could say a few words to our guests before our cake cutting. Perfect! For the evening dancing, we were able to set the disco lighting to our colour scheme, which worked really well with candles and foliage (latter 2 provided by our florist).
 
The food:
The buffet dinner was fantastic.  Pyra gave us multiple menu items to choose from and we were able to fix a nice menu that took into account guests’ dietary restrictions.  We initially booked the venue when it had a different chef and menu.  We came in a few months before our wedding to try the new menu – our dinner was delicious then and there was no dip in quality for the buffet-style served at our reception. Fionn worked with us how to plan best - because we wanted a relaxed style with a dance floor upstairs, we ended up feeding our 80 guests in two sittings downstairs, which worked perfectly. The upstairs space can seat 60 people, which didn’t work for how we planned our event, but does look really nice in photos. The late night food served around 10pm also went down very well.
 
The staff:
The staff, including the bartenders and waiters, were hardworking, friendly and very nice to guests.  Enough staff were around that guests never had to wait long for drinks.  Members of staff cut our cake for us and also boxed up the late night food for guests to bring home.  Fionn, the day-of coordinator, was on-site for our entire reception and was very helpful, even helping coordinate our midnight bus arrival.
 
Responsiveness:
Overall we were happy with the responsiveness of the venue.  It took a little while to nail down the final details of the food menu and drinks menu/bar tab but we were ultimately very happy with the result.  As the venue hosts more weddings/ larger-scale events we’d expect this will improve.

Overall:
We highly recommend Pyra for a wedding reception. We had 80 guests in total, which worked very well for the canapes/cocktail hour upstairs (4-6pm), sit-down buffet downstairs (6-8pm, split into two seatings) and dancing upstairs (8pm-midnight).  The upstairs loft was able to fit all 80 guests plus a four-piece band.  Lonsdale Road is also a charming street that provided great photo opportunities.  We looked into several other venues, and came away happy with Pyra's quote – we were able to book the venue, food (including canapes, dinner and late night food) and a generous bar tab for roughly the amount some other London venues were charging for just their space (no food or drink included). We and our guests had a fantastic time. Thanks so much to Fionn and the Pyra team :)"
V55,PYRÁ,"We had our wedding celebration at Lula. We booked the loft and restaurant for this.

Positives:
The venue is beautiful and needs minimal decoration.
The food was amazing; the chef is truly professional and everyone loved it.
They redecorated the restaurant section and added a set of couches to make it a lounge, which was beautiful.
The staff was very hardworking, professional, and lovely.

They provided us with a lounge, a wedding breakfast space and a dance floor.

Flexibility with Cake:
The bakery was scheduled to deliver and set up the cake at 16:45, but they delivered it at 09:45 instead. The Lula team handled the situation professionally by storing the cake and setting it up at the correct time. They presented the cake beautifully and assisted in cutting it into nice pieces. It could not have been more perfect.


The list of available drinks was huge, and they were happy to make custom drinks and bring in different juices if requested in advance. The event manager tried to accommodate every wish we had, and on the day we could not have hoped for more. Most of our guests said it was one of the best weddings and most beautiful venues they had ever been to.

Negatives:
Food tasting for the wedding menu was not included, which we had assumed would be, but it was given at a 50% discount. We had to sort out the floral decoration last minute, as they had initially suggested they would arrange it for us after providing a budget, but later said we needed to find our own. At times, they were a bit slow to respond, which made us anxious, but after communicating with them, this was resolved, and communication was very swift.

In conclusion:
Lula gave us the most beautiful wedding we could have dreamt of. We highly recommend them. The venue, the food, the service were amazing, and we could not have hoped for more."
V56,Sandon Manor,"We had such a special wedding at Sandon Manor, the team made every effort to make our day so so special and we will be forever grateful for that. A dream team! The day ran so smoothly and they worked so hard. The venue is unique with lots of different spaces which unfold throughout the day, which was perfect as our wedding fell on a wet and windy autumnal day. We would highly recommend Sandon Manor!"
V56,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor provided the perfect venue for our wedding. From the initial conversations and meetings with the team, we knew we were in safe hands and had made the right choice. They kept us informed with any events, made information a bit payments clear and reassured us with any query we had.
The accommodation was exceptional and fitted our requirements perfectly, with high quality finishing touches throughout to ensure our stay was as comfortable as possible.
The wedding venue was incredible! Our ceremony took place in the gorgeously modern barn with stunning draping and greenery. Following on, we had a blissful drinks reception which was on the expertly manicured lawn (with mini golf!) and sun-trap of a courtyard. We then moved onto our wedding breakfast which was held in the main barn, seating all of our guests comfortably with space for decor and extra details. Following from dinner, the part started and the club room came to life! This was absolutely the talking point of the day and our guests raved about how incredible it was! It managed to create a club-like atmosphere, whilst maintaining the vibe, albeit at a reduced volume, in the rest of the barn. The layout of the venue was important to us, as it ensured our guests never strayed too far, to keep the momentum of the day.
The team at Sandon worked superbly with all of vendors which ensured the day ran smoothly from set up to clearing. All of our vendors commented on how much they too loved working there.
The venue, the aesthetics, the staff, everything was perfect! We would absolutely recommend to anyone getting married."
V56,Sandon Manor,"We cannot recommend Sandon Manor enough. From the quality of the service, the helpfulness and friendliness of the team, the beautiful accommodation and the most amazing venue which all or guests loved partying the night away in. To make it even more special the Manor is in amazing grounds in beautiful countryside and nature reserves.
Sandon Manor made our dream come true."
V56,Sandon Manor,"I couldn't recommend Sandon Manor highly enough - from our first enquiry to our Wedding, nothing was too much trouble. The team are so friendly and easy to communicate with, very approachable and responsive. They respond to any questions immediately and having the day before to set up with Tom was fantastic. Styaying in the Manor House and Dovecote was the icing on the cake as to be with friends and family the night before and the day after was so fabulous. On the day Tom and the team were absolutely fantastic and couldn't have done more to make our special day. We couldn't have dreamt of anywhere more perfect than Sandon Manor - a huge thank you to all the staff."
V56,Sandon Manor,"If you are considering Sandon Manor for your wedding venue, I beg you: scratch it off your list now. Yes, the house and grounds are beautiful, but the people behind it are absolutely awful. They ruined our wedding experience.

I will get straight to it. Sandon Manor has a very strict policy on guests leaving the site by 11:30pm (and no one is allowed back to the Manor unless they’re official guests staying overnight). We had lots of international guests at our wedding. Many hadn’t seen each other in years and would be jetlagged - we thought they may be keen to continue chatting after 11:30pm. With this in mind, we made a booking with Sandon Village Hall via our contacts at the church (where we were attending services and later married). They granted us access to the village hall until 1am as a contingency spill over space.

We mentioned this in passing during our online meeting with one of the Sandon Manor team a month before our wedding. Within hours, I received a voicemail from the lady in charge of Village Hall bookings saying (quote) “someone at Sandon Manor is trying to throw a spanner into the works for you”. It soon transpired that they had raised an official complaint to the parish council and pressurised the village hall team into cancelling our booking. To be clear, Sandon village Hall and Sandon Manor are entirely separate entities – there is no crossover between them whatsoever, as the owner of Sandon Manor later acknowledged.

It gets worse. Gob smacked, we asked Kate – the owner of Sandon Manor – for a call to find out what was going on. She was abhorrent, trying to justify her meddling as a necessary measure to protect her wedding license (side note: with Sandon Manor it is always about the money – once your deposit is paid they care nothing for your ‘special day’; you are just another cash cow). Did she apologise for stabbing us, her clients, in the back? No, she did not. She could not even fathom how hurt we were by being completely bypassed in the communication chain and how deceitful and disrespectful this was. My husband and I were quite literally left speechless. We’ve never experienced this sort of treatment from anyone, let alone our wedding venue - to whom we were paying many thousands of pounds. Dealing with this stress in the final month of wedding prep really took its toll on us and soured things. We no longer looked forward to our day, rather dreaded what Sandon Manor might do next.

Aside from this major incident, there were many other occasions when Sandon Manor were unhelpful and unfeeling in their interactions with us:

- We enquired if it would be possible to arrange a large pizza takeaway order instead of using Sandon Manor’s caterer for our late night food. One of the team explained on a call that this wasn’t contractually possible; we acknowledged this. We then received an email saying ‘If you are unable to follow this or any other of our T&C's we would be happy to cancel your booking.’ This was less than a month before our wedding.
- We had a harpist perform in the church. We were told she wasn’t allowed to play during our drinks reception in the grounds due to potential noise complaints (an acoustic harp at 2pm in the afternoon). No other music was permitted outside the house.
- Sandon Manor is an incredibly expensive (in hindsight, grossly overpriced) venue. But we were also hit with hidden fees when booking their accommodation option - an extra £425 ‘cleaning fee’ was added to our bill.
- At the time of booking, Sandon was running a promotion waivering the £700 fee for hiring their ceremony space. As we were marrying at the church, we asked if it would please be possible to put this towards other elements of our day i.e. using their festoon string of lights in the barn (for which they charge £450). They refused.
- We were unsure about booking the 1-bed Dovecote on the grounds as - at £499 for the weekend - it was a considerable expense. While we were deciding Sandon Manor rented it out on Air BnB (to one of our guests, which made for a very awkward conversation).

To summarise, you only get one wedding day. Kate and her team absolutely ruined ours. There are so many other lovely venues in north Hertfordshire run by decent, humane people. Please prioritise your happiness and choose wisely. I wish we had."
V56,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor is a stunning wedding venue with a great team behind it. The exclusive use of the manor for the weekend was a highlight, allowing us to relax with friends and family in the lead up to and after the big day. The Sandon team were brilliant, guiding us through the planning process and ensuring everything ran smoothly on the day. We couldn't have asked for a better place and team to help us celebrate our big day."
V56,Sandon Manor,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our special day. Holly, Tom and the rest of the brilliant team made us feel welcome from day one. Special mention to Tom for making the day run so seamlessly, so professional and accommodating of all our needs.

The venue itself is stunning, located in the beautiful Hertfordshire countryside. The Manor House makes for a tremendous location to prepare, and the Dovecote suite is a nice touch: a great addition for the groom to spend the last night. We loved the small details of the characteristic main venue, with the botanical feel to the bar a great backdrop to the barn.

It’s a shame we can’t stay every week!

Dan & Suzanne"
V56,Sandon Manor,"To Holly, Louise, Tom & Kate, wow, what can we say but the biggest thank you for the best day of our lives! When we viewed the beautiful venue over two years ago we just knew instantly Sandon Manor was the one, not just because it’s stunning, but you guys are amazing! Thank you for making all our wedding dreams come true. Forever grateful and can’t wait to return to reminisce. Lots of love, the new Mr & Mrs Jakes xxx"
V56,Sandon Manor,"From the moment we visited Sandon Manor we knew this would be our wedding venue for 9 September 2023. Seeing the spectacular finish of the house carry through to the completed venue just shows the high level of attention to detail this venue had to offer.

Holly, Tom and the rest of the team filled us with confidence right from our first interactions, annd went above and beyond on the wedding weekend itself to facilitate us, our suppliers and guests. The main house, dovecote, annex and extensive grounds were a wonderful way to have close family stay with us on site, and so handy to be able to all get ready nearby the morning of.

Thank you for making our wedding weekend a truly memorable occasion, for us and our families. We all look back on this day with the happiest, sunniest memories and Sandon Manor will always have a very special place in our hearts."
V56,Sandon Manor,"We had the most amazing wedding weekend at Sandon Manor.

The venue itself is the perfect backdrop for a wedding, our photos looked amazing from every single angle. There were so many spaces to make use of throughout the day which helped things to run incredibly smoothly and meant we didn’t need to have a ‘turnaround’ during the evening. The spaces really wowed our guests and created such a lovely atmosphere. Including the ‘club room’ dance floor that had our guests dancing until the very last song!

We stayed at the Manor House for the weekend, extending our wedding into a perfect weekend retreat. The house itself is beautiful, with lots of different areas for everyone to relax, and the perfect peaceful location to chill the night before the big day!

From our first viewing to checking out the day after our wedding, the Sandon staff were attentive, friendly and helped us feel relaxed and looked after throughout an otherwise overwhelming process. We’d highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for a beautiful, peaceful and unique wedding venue!"
V57,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Thank you so much to the entire team for making our wedding so special! Thanks to Donique, MJ, Mo, Harry and everyone else for helping us organise our day and for their professional but friendly attitude. Merchant Taylors is such a beautiful venue and offers a brilliant layout and different spaces to make the day so special!"
V57,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you all so very much for such an amazing wedding on Saturday. You all worked tirelessly to make it so special. Everything was truly wonderful and you all did me proud! Both Hugh and I couldn’t have asked for anything more in terms of being so well looked after. Our guests were so impressed and have given us so many compliments on a brilliantly well run event. Thank you all again for playing a brilliant part in our truly wonderful day of which we loved every minute
V57,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you so much for the most wonderful wedding reception at the end of April. We had the perfect day and our guests all commented on how well looked after they has been. Thank you again for all your hard work!
V57,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"We know this is very late (we have no excuse), but we wanted to say thank you for everything you and the team at Merchant Taylor's did for us on our wedding day. All the guests have since told us how much they loved the venue, food and service. Fingers crossed you get a few couples getting in touch! Again, Thank You for everything!"
V57,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"My brother and I attended the wedding today, as Florist's for the wedding party.
We were treated fantastically well by ALL the staff that we met, nothing was too much trouble and they made our task a COMPLETE pleasure.
If this is how they treat the actual wedding party then you will have a unforgettable time. Many thanks to all the staff for helping us to do our job with ease ."
V57,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Zara,

Can we thank you and your team at Merchant Taylor’s Hall for all your hard work in making Caroline and Neil’s recent wedding so very special. You, in particular, were able to deal with every question and request in a really professional manner.

Merchant Taylors’ Hall is part of the rich panoply of history and tradition, which makes this great City. All of our guests, and in particular those from abroad, were totally spell bound by the atmosphere, the food and service.

James was superb in organising the whole operation. To turn the Great Hall from a wedding ceremony hall to a banqueting suite for 110 guests, including flowers, place settings and dance floor in ninety minutes was truly remarkable.

The food and wine was of an amazing standard, we know that Merchant Taylors’ Hall has a reputation for presenting some of the finest dining in the City of London. You certainly surpassed all expectations.

We have many wonderful memories of the 10th September 2016, but it is best summed up by our daughter Caroline, “Can we do it all over again?”."
V58,Garden Museum,I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate everything that you did to make our party such a success last Friday. It was brilliant being outside on such a lovely everning. Everyone was very impressed with the venue.
V58,Garden Museum,"Thank you for all your help, advice and on-the-day support, it really made our wedding very special and it certianly went off without a hitch! The Museum looked amazing and the garden was perfect, especially as the sunshine adn the guests wanted to make the most of the beautiful surroundings."
V59,Clearwell Castle,"Can’t tell you how wonderful the team were at Clearwell. Our wedding coordinator Phaedra was exceptional. Attention to detail and everyone of the team from front of house, waiting staff, groundsmen and the DJ made our day absolutely everything we dreamed of and unique to us.

Can’t recommend highly enough and cost was outstanding value for money.

So many our guest commented on the quality of the food and that it was the best wedding they had been too! The children loved the magic of the castle and opportunity to get outside and see the grounds.

The grooms family had a fabulous time staying in the cottages the night before and our guests at both the Castle & the Wyndham had a fabulous stay on the night of the wedding.

Wish we could do it all again!"
V59,Clearwell Castle,We had our wedding at Clearwell in June and we couldn’t recommend it highly enough. From start to finish everything was perfect and they went above and beyond to ensure we had an amazing day. I’d not hesitate in recommending them to any couples. Just a gorgeous place with staff that really care in making your day all that you hope it will be.
V59,Clearwell Castle,"From the moment we first visited Clearwell, we knew this was the venue for us. From the moment we started planning to the final touches on the day, all the staff were fantastic. Ann, our wedding coordinator, was a delight to work with throughout. Nothing was too much trouble and she kept us updated throughout. The day was tailored exactly to our needs and when we arrived at the venue on the day they had prepared everything perfectly.

We did the night before package which included rooms and food the evening before. We were supplied with so much food no one went hungry. The rooms in the Wyndham and the Castle are fantastically appointed.

The venue itself is gorgeous. The cellar bar downstairs adds a whole different dimension to the occasion where you can really let your hair down.

This was an absolute dream come true venue for us. We loved every single minute."
V59,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot fault this venue at all. We initially had to change our wedding date because of lockdown and they were so supportive and empathetic.
Ann, our coordinator, is quite possibly the loveliest person on the planet. She was always happy to answer any questions and it never felt like we were being a nuisances or asking a silly question.
On the morning of the wedding she was a lovely calm presence and the whole day just ran like clockwork.
The food was out of this world with many guests saying it was the best food they’d had at a wedding and one person actually thought we’d hired a Michellin Chef!
The venue is so so beautiful with plenty of space. The downstairs cellar was a great place to party the night away, it was like an exclusive nightclub. There were lots of quieter rooms for people who wanted some peace.
The DJ was brilliant, we forgot to give a list of songs we liked but he did a great job of guessing what we liked ( he must’ve looked at our age and figured nineties dance music was our era. And he was bang on the money)
I do not have a single complaint about this venue"
V59,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot speak highly enough about Clearwell Castle as a wedding venue. The venue itself is absolutely stunning. It rained on our wedding day but the indoor space was so vast and beautiful that ourselves and our guests still had the most amazing time! Our wedding co-ordinator, Phaedra, was absolutely incredible, both before and during the wedding. She was always so professional, replied to all of my emails (there were many) and answered all queries efficiently. On the day, we genuinely could not have managed without her. The day flowed so well with her guidance and it really helped me as the Bride as I felt I didn't need to worry about anything! All the other staff at Clearwell and at the Wyndham hotel were also so wonderful! Everyone worked so hard and every member of staff was so kind to us; it just made our day incredibly special and we are so appreciative to them all. The food was great, service very quick and all the guests really enjoyed it! We had so many compliments about the staff and venue! I honestly could not recommend Clearwell castle more as a wedding venue!"
V59,Clearwell Castle,"Our wedding on 10/11/23 was just the absolute perfect day from start to finish. Our wedding planner manager, Hannah, was incredible, not just on the day but throughout the whole planning process. She ensured everything ran smoothly on the day, sparing no details ensuring everything was just perfect and to time but without being stressful. She was very accommodating with the planning meetings working around both mine and my now Husband's shift patterns.
We both stayed the night before our wedding and the night of the wedding with many of our guests travelling a distance so also staying in the Wyndham which was very convenient. Staying in Keepers cottage with the Bridesmaids the night before added to the experience with the added feature of the hot tub, the groomsmen were very jealous. The beds were very comfortable and everyone was excited to stay in a castle.
On the day of the wedding, the staff were very accommodating moving the bridal party along to the bridal suite to finish preparations earlier than originally planned. The breakfast provided was the perfect amount for a busy morning getting ready. Everything, including the gardens, were immaculately kept adding to the WOW factor of getting married in a Castle.
The canapes served and welcome drinks were well received by the guests and ourselves whilst we had photographers prior to the wedding breakfast. The food was phenomenal and great portions and I was stuffed after. The staff were very accommodating for us with a lot of people with allergies, dislikes of mushrooms so adapting the menu for these individual people. We were even able to swap out a few bottles of wine included in our package for cocktails as us as the Bride and Groom did not drink wine.
As soon as we walked in the venue the first time, we knew it was the place we wanted to get married. Everytime we went back to view the venue again I fell more and more in love. For anyone thinking about viewing or even booking this incredible venue I would say do it! We will be going back for events in the future to relive the best day of our lives."
V59,Clearwell Castle,"We got married at Clearwell castle April 2023. What can I say it's the most perfect venue and we had the most amazing day. The organisation was amazing and the staff were great on the day and even leading up to the big day. Phaedra was our wedding planner and communication with her was great throughout and on our wedding day she ensured that it all ran smoothly. I cannot recommend Clearwell castle and their staff enough. Thank you again for helping us have our dream wedding.
Kind regards

Vanessa & David x"
V59,Clearwell Castle,"We had the most amazing wedding day on the 24th of November 2023, the whole day ran so smoothly and all our guests absolutely loved the venue. The food was amazing and our guests loved the fish and chip buffet in the evening! The whole progress of planning the wedding was so straight forward and Phedera was a great wedding manager."
V59,Clearwell Castle,"Clearwell Castle exceeded all our expectations for our wedding day. The moment we stepped onto the grounds, we were captivated by its timeless charm. The staff, especially Hannah, went above and beyond to make every detail perfect, ensuring a seamless and stress-free experience. The Ball Room, where we exchanged our vows, felt like something out of a storybook. The surrounding gardens provided a stunning backdrop for photos and added to the overall enchantment of the day. Our guests were equally impressed, and many commented on the unique and romantic atmosphere. Choosing Clearwell Castle was the best decision we made for our special day; it truly felt like a fairy-tale come to life."
V59,Clearwell Castle,"We had the perfect wedding at Clearwell Castle, their team were superb in providing planning assistance from the point of our booking, guidance on all aspects of our wedding choices from registrars and suppliers, and coordination on the day of the wedding to make sure it flowed seamlessly. It was a beautiful day, and we couldn't be happier with our choice of Wedding location."
V60,Inner Temple,We got married here in 2023. Everything was perfect and the team made sure the day/food etc was just as we wanted it. Particular thanks to Priya and Eva (Pegasus) for their hard work making our wedding day and lead up so special.
V61,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"I got married at Dodford Manor in February this year. A great time was had by all and I will be recommending the venue to any friends planning weddings.

The weather was bad on the day so we didn’t get to use the outside area very much, but it didn’t matter as the inside is so lovely.

Sky was really helpful and put me at ease on the day. Questions in the lead up and on the day were answered quickly and I was made to feel like the only bride in the world!"
V61,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford was the first venue we looked at shortly after we got engaged. The staff were friendly and relaxed when we had a tour, I knew it was the place for us! I think Lydia telling my now husband that we couldn’t have fireworks due to the animals nearby but we could have a fire performer outside, sold the deal for us! I got an amazing fire performer as a surprise for my husband and the guests after we had sparklers, and it just completed an amazing day!
We heard such positive things Dodford about how professional and smooth running weddings have been from our suppliers, and you guys didn’t disappoint. You handled the day so well, we didn’t worry about a thing and just enjoyed ourselves the whole day.
We honestly had so many lovely messages and conversations after our wedding about how the venue was amazing, everything and everyone was catered for, from my 88 year old Nan, to young children who could play and enjoy the outdoors with a scoop of amazing ice cream. We honestly couldn’t have asked for a better day, we would do it again in a heartbeat if we could! Thank you for making the day so seamless! We are eternally grateful to everyone at Dodford for making our dreams come true becoming Mr and Mrs Price!"
V61,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford Manor what an incredible venue, from initial enquiry to booking, Dodford and the staff were so accommodating and well organised. Nothing was ever too much trouble, even if emails were being sent at 11pm. The day itself, wow it was absolutely incredible, as our wedding was on a budget and due to small numbers Dodford were amazing at setting out our decorations, everything was absolutely perfect and a special shout out to Kayleigh who was amazing on our wedding day. She kept us on time, always checking we were okay and just such a lovely person and really made our day perfect. Would highly recommend a Dodford to any couple due to be married they make the planning and the day an absolute dream and we want to relive it over again."
V61,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"It goes without saying that Dodford is a fab venue.... stunning set up, well maintained, clean, perfect grounds etc... but the best thing about Dodford is the team! I had super high expectations of any wedding venue I booked as I used to run a wedding venue myself (potential nightmare client 😂).... from the 1st viewing the team were fantastic. Relaxed, stress free, organised, professional, knowledgeable, flexible but mostly importantly friendly which gave me complete confidence in them delivering my perfect day.
In the run up to the big day the team are super responsive on email and phone We didn't meet our Event Manager, Lydia, until the day but I was always confident that they work as a whole team and therefore having 1 point of contact was not necessary at all.
In the day Lydia was amazing! Still relaxed and professional and the whole day ran so smoothly. Every requirement was perfect, on time, delivered exceptionally.
We had the best day, thank you to the whole team (especially Lydia!)
Vic & Tony

V61,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We honestly can’t say thank you enough for how amazing Dodford Manor Barn was, along with all the incredible staff who helped make our day truly unforgettable.

From the moment we visited, we fell in love with the beautiful landscapes, open-plan barns, and stunning large windows that flooded the space with natural light. The venue package was one of the best we saw during our search—it felt like everything we could possibly need was covered.

The team at Dodford Manor Barn were incredibly friendly and supportive throughout the entire planning process. Communication was open and consistent, which made everything feel so much more manageable and stress-free. We were even able to find all of our wonderful vendors through Dodford Manor Barn, which was a huge bonus!

As a bride who suffers from anxiety, I was unwell on the morning of the wedding. But I have to give special thanks to Kayleigh and our vendors, who were absolutely amazing and supported me through every step—they helped me feel calm, cared for, and ready to enjoy the day.

Our guests couldn’t stop talking about how stunning the venue was and how lovely the food turned out. We were also lucky enough to have sunshine all day, topped off with a beautiful sunset in the evening—it truly felt magical.

Thank you again, Dodford Manor Barn, for being such a perfect place to start our next chapter.

With love,
Carter & Emmie (24.03.2025) x"
V61,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"From the moment we booked our wedding at Dodford Manor, we knew we were in good hands—but nothing could have prepared us for just how extraordinary the experience would be. Every single detail was handled with such precision, care, and genuine warmth that it truly felt like a dream come to life.

The venue itself is breathtaking, but what made our day unforgettable was the impeccable service. The entire team operated like a well-oiled machine, making sure everything ran smoothly while keeping the atmosphere joyful and stress-free. Their attention to detail was second to none—no request was too big or too small.

We want to give a heartfelt, special shoutout to *Lydia*, our incredible Wedding Manager. From our first meeting to the final dance, she was nothing short of amazing. Lydia went above and beyond at every turn—anticipating needs before we even voiced them, coordinating flawlessly with suppliers, and offering support with a calming confidence that put us completely at ease, (apart from making me cry the second I saw her! 😂). Her passion for what she does shone through in every interaction, and our day would not have been the same without her.

Thanks to this amazing venue and its phenomenal team (especially Lydia!), we were able to truly enjoy every moment of our wedding, knowing everything was in the best possible hands. If you're considering this venue for your big day—don’t hesitate. It’s everything you hope for, and more.

We want to do it over and over!
A day we will NEVER forget!!

Thank you again and all our Love,
Mr & Mr Pargeter-Prince
Rowan & Karl xx"
V61,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We booked Dodford Manor in Feb 2024 after we viewed the space, for our wedding in March 2025. It was the only venue we viewed, but instantly fell in love with the character and variety of spaces the venue had to offer. The free corkage also really appealed to us as a great way for us to bring our own drinks at a good cost.

From start to end, the team were amazing, helping us with the planning of the day and making sure we had a great array of suppliers we could work with. The live band was a huge part of our day, and Dodford have a great mixture of acts on their supplier list.

On the day of the wedding, the groomsmen arrived at the venue to help with set up to see that our amazing event manager, Kayleigh had every single aspect of the day in hand and sorted. She sorted all table settings, decor, stationary - Everything!! Nothing was too much to ask of her and the Dodford team. The day ran impeccably well, with everything being on time and everything we asked for being sorted. Our drinks were served chilled, on time and were always around. It’s easy for venues who offer free corkage to try and limit you drinking your own drink - Not here!! There was constantly beers being topped up, wine bottles replaced and aperol spritz being taken round. Cannot fault them!

The team packed all of our bits away and ready for us to collect the next morning. We are very aware Dodford is a busy venue and wanted to make sure we wasn’t just “another wedding” but at no point was that the case. We felt like we were the one and only wedding and genuinely could not ask for more!

Thank you so so much for everything, Highly recommended!!"
V61,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We got married her a month ago today and had the most amazing day with them. Jess, Jack and the team made sure that everything ran smoothly and that they were doing everything they could for us on the day. We would 100% recommend them for anyone wishing to marry in such a beautiful setting."
V61,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We had been apprehensive booking Dodford for our reception that it was so popular in Northamptonshire that our wedding could end up looking the same as a lot of others we knew of, as we're local - but that was a ridiculous thing to worry about! The level of flexibility/customisation you get with Dodford is unmatched in our opinion; as it's such a beautiful venue to start with, you don't have to work hard to make it look good before adding in your personality as a couple!

The whole process from enquiries to final planning and the execution on the day were great. We did have a slight issue with them not inviting us to a food tasting in enough time before our wedding date (whether they forgot/we were missed off a list we don't know) but when we did raise it they invited us to a tasting at their sister venue instead (it's 2 hours away but we were available to travel thankfully). Every member of staff we encountered in our experience with Dodford were so friendly and make you feel like you are the only couple that matters for them in that moment, which we really appreciated from such a popular/busy venue. Abbie was our Event Manager on the day and provided such an elevated level of service, nothing was too much trouble and she executed our plans/vision to a tee, adding in some extra details that we loved too.

Our wedding was in December 2024, and we only had our reception at Dodford, so the ceremony barn was set up for our drinks reception with plenty of space for guests without it feeling cramped or equally like we were all rattling around in there (we had 75 guests for our reception). They don't have many photos of indoor drinks receptions in their promo so I was a little worried how it would look but the team had it set up beautifully. We also had a brass band on the mezzanine level which was really fun and festive!

What sold Dodford for us was the no daytime corkage, which meant we could really personalise our drinks reception and wedding breakfast drinks without breaking the bank. There was a slight disconnect with how and when we had requested/planned to serve some of the drinks in our planning meeting and what happened on the day, which we think may have been a slight hiccup in communication between Dodford and Jenkinsons (the caterers), but it didn't have a negative impact on our day at all!

Overall, there's a reason this is such a popular venue - it is truly perfect!"
V61,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,Dodford manor is an amazing wedding venue. From the very beginning when we first stepped into the venue to look around we fell in love. We knew we had to have our wedding there. After booking the venue we had amazing contact with the staff from booking our food tasting session. To a general email to see how our wedding planning was going. The planning meeting was well organised and we were able to talk through exactly what we wanted and no want was too big for the team.
V62,Gosfield Hall,"I never imagined my wedding would be somewhere as stunning as Gosfield hall but from the minute we saw this venue we knew it was the one for us and didn't bother viewing anymore venues as we had already made our minds up about having our wedding here! We were absolutely blown away with the natural beauty of Gosfield hall and so booked two years in advance of our wedding day! The professionalism and advice we received from Linda was super helpful and informative on the run up to our wedding as there is soo much to think about! We loved that we could have our day and evening all in one place aswell as the option weather permitting to have our wedding ceremony outside. I'm pleased to say the weather was absolutely perfect on our wedding day and we got to have our fairytale wedding outside! The package we paid for was well worth the money! Our guests were absolutely spoilt on our day and have all said it was the best wedding they've ever been too! It was amazing to have our guests stay over aswell! Jocie our wedding planner was absolutely amazing! She was sooo friendly and super accommodating and went above and beyond on our day to make it absolutely perfect with no hiccups! She even helped dress me on the day as she knew how to do up a corset dress and my mother didn't have a clue lol she made all my wedding details and decorations come to life and done such a stunning job decorating our dream venue aswell as being super supportive towards me my family and guests! The honeymoon suite is the best we've ever seen and completely took ours and our guests breaths away! Mind blowing! The food,venue,grounds,accomodation and night before accomodation were absolutely stunning and we want to thank everyone at Gosfield hall for making our day soo incredible and special and a day we and our guests will never forget! We can't wait to return to Gosfield! Thank you everyone at Gosfield what an amazing place!"
V62,Gosfield Hall,"We had previously experienced Gosfield Hall as a guest before deciding on it for our anniversary.

Our day was beautiful and went according to plan. Our guests all had great feedback about the day.

The only thing we would have changed would have been more diverse menu for the main meals."
V62,Gosfield Hall,"Gosfield hall is a beautiful location for a wedding and their packages cover all the important stuff! We didn’t have to worry about caterers, wedding coordinator or a DJ - all included! Great service, lovely food and everyone really enjoyed the day! Our coordinator Jocie was fab on the day, getting everything organised and fetching anything we needed. Couldn’t have asked for better, she knew the time line and the day flowed really smoothly!"
V62,Gosfield Hall,"We got married at Gosfield Hall and everything about it was perfect from when we arrive to view it, booking, the communication and Faye Carter our wedding Coordinator! If you want the best wedding day with no hassle, Gosfield is your place!!"
V62,Gosfield Hall,"Myself and my Wife have just got married at Gosfield Hall,
Our expensive started when we viewed the venue and we first met Linda sales manager, she welcome us in & made us feel at home, we wasn’t sure how, but she made us feel calm like this was where we was meant to be.
Once we looked around at all the venue has to offer we had already made a decision as this is such a stunning location and instantly new this was what we wanted! It was just right for us.

We did not get made to feel pressured to make any decisions immediately however we did end up booking our big say within the next few days after our visit.

Our next contact was with Ellie our wedding planner, she was very helpful and nothing was ever to much, we enjoyed the food tasting at the venue and was very impressed with the experience, it was out of this world.
Ellie helped us through all of our problems and made sure all of our plans come to life.

Now on our big day, what can I say? The staff were amazing, Ellie couldn’t have done enough every time you wanted to ask a question she was next to us any time we needed something. She was there all the way through the day/ night & even the next morning, Ellie made our day Run seamlessly.
We’ve been to many weddings before but never have we had food as amazing as we did here.
Every guest was amazed at the food quality and commented on how delicious it was!
Just to sum up if you’re thinking about booking your wedding at Gosfield Hall don’t question it just book it. You will be amazed."
V62,Gosfield Hall,"The venue is stunning and was the perfect setting for our winter wedding (so much natural light even in January). Jocie Golbourn was our assigned wedding planning specialist and she is so kind, sweet, patient and professional. All our guests loved the venue but many actually commented on how flawless and seamless the day was organised and rooms decorated and prepared from each section of the wedding and we only have Jocie and venue staff to thank for their meticulous planning and preparations. The food and drinks were delicious. Couldn’t recommend this venue enough- we actually booked the venue on a whim and were SO happy when we visited for an open day. There’s no false advertisements- it’s stunning."
V62,Gosfield Hall,"Everything, from start to finish, was exactly what we wanted and more. The preparation was helped by our wonderful personal manager, Tara, and accommodated each and every one of our requests and needs. The venue is gorgeous, food delicious, and atmosphere felt special. Our friends and family all told us that this was such a spectacular wedding for them that it was the best they've ever been to. We felt completely taken care of, kept us calm and happy throughout the day, and kept all of our suppliers in place and to standard. It felt glamourous and unique. We wish we could relive the day over and over. It really was our dream wedding."
V62,Gosfield Hall,"We got married in Gosfield Hall in May and had the most amazing wedding day that any couple could ask for. The whole experience from the arrival the night before to leaving the day after was seamlessly managed by the team at the venue.
The house and the grounds looked absolutely stunning and Ellie and the team did a brilliant job at keeping the day running smoothly without making anyone feel rushed. Everyone there was immensely friendly and helpful and we really felt that everyone who worked there was invested in making our day feel special.
We fell in love with the venue when we booked it but the whole experience exceeded out expectations so much that we wish we could do it all again!"
V62,Gosfield Hall,"I wanted to take a moment to commend and state our appreciation for Jocie. She truly was phenomenal, approachable and no task was too big.
We had 5 months to plan our wedding and we loved every moment. With us both working in the service industry it was great to have someone who was so switched on and would be an asset to have on any team."
V62,Gosfield Hall,"Having just got married at Gosfield Hall I can honestly say it was the most beautiful venue and the most perfect day. The staff were so attentive and professional. The food was outstanding and the drinks and cocktails were fabulous. They couldn’t do enough to make sure our day was everything we’d dreamt of. I have to say a special thanks to Ellie - one of the wedding coordinators on site - she went above and beyond to help us plan our day and was there from the very moment I woke up delivering fresh pastries for breakfast to the moment she made me a cup of tea to go to bed with. I can’t thank you enough Ellie, you are an absolute credit to Gosfield Hall."
V63,Kingston Estate Totnes,"When I first enquired with Kingston I thought it would be too expensive but we explained what are budget was and when we wanted to get married and they put a quote together that was affordable.
We have just had the most amazing one day wedding which didn't finish until the early hours. We got married in the Long Barn where there are chandeliers running down the middle, it was very romantic. There is this nightclub at Kingston which is very cool which everyone loved. The guests all said the venue was stunning and the food was out of this world.
A few of us stayed the night before and most of our guests stayed the night of the wedding in the cottages and barns. The staff were brilliant and they coordinated the whole day for us. I cant recommend the venue enough."
V63,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had a two day wedding at the Kingston Estate. All our guests were completely blown away by it.
Most of our friends and family had traveled far for the weekend and were not disappointed when then arrived as the cottages and barns are gorgeous. Some even have hot tubs.
Jodie and the Weddings Team organised a welcome party for the first night which was unreal along with providing street style food for everyone around 8.30 pm. At Kingston they have this really cool enormous Yurt and food hut which is used the day before the wedding and for breakfast.
On the wedding day itself we got married in the Walled Garden and there were endless canapes during the drinks reception. We then decided to eat in the Hayloft Barn which has glass windows overlooking all the gardens.
We used the clear span marquee for our reception party and had the craziest cover band before we all went into the nightclub until 3 am. The good thing about Kingston is everything is included they let you use things like cake stands, easels, knifes, speakers, microphones, all furniture at no extra cost, they set everything up for you and then clean up afterwards. We didn]t have to do anything which made everything totally stress free.

Thank you Jodie, Ellie and Charlotte it was insane !!"
V63,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had the most magical wedding at Kingston. From the moment we set foot onto the grounds, we knew it was the perfect place for our special day. It was our first viewing… and nothing else compared for us (we saw a total of 6 venues). What stood out to us the most was the variety of spaces available for each part of the day. The selection of ceremony areas, the beautiful outdoor spots for photos, the yurt for the night before party, and a special one for us… the underground nightclub for the evening! As party lovers, this was a part that sold it for us; there was somewhere for every moment.

One of the things we loved most was the flexibility to personalize every aspect of our wedding. The venue truly felt like a blank canvas that we could transform into our dream setting, but equally, we got away with doing absolutely nothing as it was beautiful all on its own.

But what truly made our experience unforgettable was the incredible staff, led by Jodie. They were not only professional and attentive but also genuinely warm and welcoming. Their support and attention to detail ensured that everything ran smoothly, allowing us to relax and fully enjoy our day.

We're hoping to return and stay in the future, for a special occasion.

It's not just a wedding venue; it's a place that holds a special spot in our hearts as the backdrop to the beginning of our happily ever after 🤍"
V63,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Kingston was perfect. Despite a rainy start, the day was amazing and Jodie was available but subtly in the background allowing the day to be ours."
V63,Kingston Estate Totnes,"After over a two and a half year wait due to Covid, our son and his wife had a wonderful wedding weekend. Jodie from Kingston Estate and her team of staff went above and beyond to ensure the wedding ran smoothly. Every detail was dealt with professionally. The accommodation, venue and food were all excellent and all our guests many from overseas had a wonderful time. The only thing Jodie could not oversee was the weather but even a little rain didn't spoil the celebrations."
V63,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue and staff were brilliant from start to finish. The venue is really multi-functional and caters for rain or shine. The weather was really unpredictable around the time of our wedding but I was a stress free bride knowing they had it in hand. The food supplier was stunning - we had a weekend package which all the guests raved about. That coupled with the unlimited drinks pages made it the perfect venue for us. A Devon treasure that feels like being on a film set - everyone loved it!
V63,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Such a beautiful venue - we loved it so much. The food was incredible and despite having a changeover of wedding planner close to the wedding day, it had no impact on our day what so ever. The venue are calm and professional and loved their approach to communication which was friendly."
V63,Kingston Estate Totnes,Fell in love with the venue on our first visit. We were particularly looking for a venue which could cater us for 3 days and sleep the majority of the the guests. The grounds were well kept especially the walled garden which is where the ceremony took place. The team were a pleasure and made the day truly special.
V63,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Our 3-day wedding celebrations were spent at the STUNNING Kingston Estate - a truly unique venue that we absolutely fell in love with. It had EVERYTHING we were looking for & more. The grounds are perfectly manicured all year round & come complete with walled garden. The cottages & main house are beautifully decorated, providing luxurious accommodation for 86 of our guests. Sarah & the team were such a pleasure to work with & couldn’t do enough for us. The catering was also top notch. Thank you"
V63,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue was great we had a few personal health issues beforehand but the team went above and beyond to make the day extra special. The wedding planner organised everything for us and they had plenty of props on site that we were free to use. We had the whole place to ourselves for the weekend it was brilliant and our friends loved the hot tub and pool.
V64,Holmewood Hall,"We were married at Holmewood Hall on 15th February 2025 and I can honestly say that it was the most magical day. We went to visit the venue and instantly fell in love with it but even we were blown away by how beautiful everything looked on the day. All of the staff were amazing - special shoutout to our personal wedding manager, Laura Pike, who was always on hand to answer any questions - she couldn’t do enough for us! The food was wonderful & we had full control over the menu. Would highly recommend this venue, you won’t regret it!"
V64,Holmewood Hall,"Holmewood Hall was an absolutely perfect wedding venue. The house is stunning, well cared for and beautifully decorated. All of the staff are so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Our Wedding Coordinator was fantastic, available from early morning of the wedding and was still there the morning after working for us. The food was excellent, drinks and canapes were amazing and the venue took care of everything for us. We had the most perfect wedding and are so pleased we chose Holmewood Hall. The Gold Room where we had our ceremony is gorgeous. Thank you for giving us a beautiful wedding!"
V64,Holmewood Hall,"I cannot fault this venue at all, the venue itself is breathtakingly beautiful with magnificent rooms and very lovingly maintained grounds. The staff are incredibly friendly, professional and efficient, our wedding coordinator Lee was a pleasure to work with and made our special day run smoothly. If you want a hassle free wedding with breathtaking grounds and the most amazing staff then this is the venue for you."
V64,Holmewood Hall,"Had the most amazing wedding here recently and cannot recommend it enough.

The venue itself is stunning and the options included in the luxe package covered everything we could've possibly wanted and made planning the wedding 100x less stressful.

The staff were all amazing from start to finish, Katie showed us around initially and then Lee was our personal wedding manager, and they were both incredible throughout. Always on hand to answer any questions and help us through the day once we got there.
We had so many comments from our guests on how lovely the staff were on the day!

A particular highlight though was the food - the tasting evening was a dream and the chef went above and beyond to provide a full vegan menu for us which wasn't limited to only a couple of options.
Again, we had so many non-vegan guests complimenting the food and saying how lovely it was!

Overall, an incredible day and an incredible venue.
Thank you so much to everyone there!"
V64,Holmewood Hall,"This place is simply just amazing 🤩
We had our wedding here on 17-12-24 and it was everything we dreamed of and more. The food, staff, decor were just perfect not forgetting the most beautiful Christmas tree 😍
Our person wedding planner Lee was an absolute god send not just having him there on the day but always being at the end of a phone to answer any questions or worry’s.
If we could go back and do it all again we would and not change a single thing.
The most perfect day at the most perfect venue ♥️"
V64,Holmewood Hall,Perfect venue for a wedding with guest numbers 60 - 100. Our guests and I moved from each room to a new room throughout the day and every room had a new surprise. The bridal suite was lush and it was great having all our guests staying under one roof. I would 100% recommend this to anyone.
V64,Holmewood Hall,"The wedding day and lead up to the day were fab. However, for the price we paid, we expected a little bit more.
I opted to use the bridal cottage the evening before for which we paid £450 extra. This is something I now regret, as there was no hot water and we were not able to order any food in as all the take away options were shut (on a Friday night). The hot tub also needed a good clean. So the night before/morning of my wedding was not ideal. I flagged this to the manager who advised that we should have raised the cold water issue as soon as possible, but seeing as we were trying to have morning showers on the wedding day, this did not leave us any time.
Our package included pre-drinks, wine with dinner and we also purchased a cocktail ""cart"" (cocktails on a table) and a bucket of beers. The groom, who is not a wine fan, asked for a beer with his wedding meal and was presented with a contactless card machine to pay for it at the top table. We felt this was a bit unnecessary as there was a full bucket of extra beers outside and it felt a little embarrassing having a card machine presented to us at the top table on our wedding day for one measly Corona, despite the huge amount we had paid. Also, guests were unknowingly allowed to buy beers from the bar after the meal, despite there being available beers to them already in a bucket next to the bar...
Overall the wedding was lovely, but for the price we paid we expected a bit better. Essentially, I loved the venue, but I wish we had not purchased any extras!"
V64,Holmewood Hall,"We got married at Holmewood Hall on 4th October 2024. From the first moment we stepped into the venue and I saw the magnificent Gold room I knew this would be the perfect place for us to get married. We had the most amazing day which was perfectly coordinated by the whole team at Holmewood but especially so by our personal wedding manager Lee. Lee was always quick to respond to any questions we had in the lead up to the day and nothing was too much trouble for him.
We honestly wish we could do it all over again as it was a magical day. We would recommend Holmewood Hall to anyone looking for the perfect venue."
V64,Holmewood Hall,"After getting engaged in late March this year we wanted to get married fairly quickly so booked Holmewood for the same September. The venue, grounds, accomodation were all stunning and we felt very fortunate it was within budget and the package we got was outstanding in comparison to other venues and what it included, which was far far more than other venues. We got to attend a luxe event to choose all our wedding food, canapés, cocktails and wines which should have made things easier but due to the unbelievable quality it made it harder! Our wedding planner Lee is literally the most fantastic person. He was flexible, fun, engaged and on absolutely everything. The day was ran impeccably and also smooth even with some weather concerns and speeches taking a bit longe than we thought. If you book here ask for Lee!! We had the most perfect day. Can’t fault a single things. Our guests all told us how incredible everything was with one even saying he will now longer not attend any further weddings unless it’s at Holmewood. Thank you to all the staff and as mentioned a huge special thank you to Lee! Your a legend!"
V64,Holmewood Hall,"Exceptional venue, stunning grounds, fantastic DJ, and excellent service. Highly recommended! Happiest day of my life 😊"
V65,Bourton Hall,"We got married at Bourton Hall on 08 March 2025 and our wedding planner was Harminder. The day was absolutely amazing from start to finish. All the food and drinks were of a high standard and presented beautifully which includes the wedding breakfast, canapés and cocktails, and breakfast the next day. The venue is gorgeous with lots of rooms, well maintained grounds and exclusive use. The staff are friendly and accommodating and the event was really well managed. We would like to particularly thank Harminder, who was supportive throughout the wedding planning process and the wedding day, ensuring things ran smoothly and in a timely manner. He is a great communicator, provided advice and guidance where needed and attention to detail. We really had a magical day! Thank you so much! We would happily do it all over again and would definitely recommend this venue!"
V65,Bourton Hall,"What a fabulous wedding venue! Because it's a wedding venue and not a hotel that holds the occasional wedding, they really focused on what was important and anticipated our every need. It's an elegant venue but with a comfortable feel to it. The team are incredibly accommodating and helpful and each couple is allocated their own personal wedding manager to guide them through the process and to make sure every detail is covered.
There's a beautiful chapel on site where non-religious ceremonies can be held - this was fabulous.
The food was plentiful and delicious - all our guests raved about it. Great choice of welcome drinks and canapes, wines and cocktails.
The grounds are gorgeous; a perfect backdrop for our October wedding.
The venue was exclusively ours and has beautiful bedrooms, including a huge, stunning bridal suite. Most of our guests stayed overnight and took advantage of the brilliant breakfast in the morning so it really extended the celebration."
V65,Bourton Hall,"Our wedding at Bourton Hall was better than we ever imagined. The Italianate mansion is truly spectacular inside and out however it is the team that made our day run perfectly. Our guests found the setting and the food incredible, they were very impressed! Our wedding planner Emily Sarjant was fantastic her knowledge and expertise made our day magical from start to finish, with all the special touches that she suggested. Our first dance was created in such a beautiful way it will be a memory we cherish forever. Thank you to Emily and the team at Bourton Hall. My husband would also like to note that the croquembouche was amazing and everyone should have one."
V65,Bourton Hall,"My wife and I got married at Bourton Hall in September, with our wedding managed by the wonderful Eleni. Everything about the day went as perfectly as we could've wished, right from arrival to departure the following day. The venue is stunning, and the food was lovely, and having 21 bedrooms on site was such a bonus so that all of our close friends and family could stay on site with us.
Bourton Hall did everything they could both in the run up to the day and on the day itself to alleviate all stress to ensure everything ran as seamlessly as possible, which it absolutely did.
We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall enough."
V65,Bourton Hall,"We were married on 28th July 2024. What an amazing day we had at Bourton Hall. Could not fault it! The venue is so elegant! The grounds and views were to die for. The food was out of this world with so many choices and all cooked and served to perfection. Accommodation / rooms were plentiful and luxurious. Lovely to have a chapel on site too. We had the whole place to ourselves, we felt like royalty! Lots of varied rooms and areas for people to choose where they wanted to be after the wedding breakfast. We would choose the venue all over again!"
V65,Bourton Hall,"We had both our wedding ceremony and reception at Bourton Hall and the service was superb throughout. The house and grounds are beautiful with amazing views to go with them. The staff were professional and helpful during the lead up to our wedding day and during the day as well - even when we had an emergency prior to the ceremony which caused delays, the venue staff were able to work around this to move timings back in order to allow all of our planned activities to go ahead and be fully enjoyed. All the food was delicious and we had a wonderful wedding day thanks to Bourton Hall."
V65,Bourton Hall,"We had the most perfect wedding day at Bourton Hall. Throughout the planning process and on the day, the team were so professional, which meant we could relax and know that everything was in their capable hands - Emily was an amazing wedding manager. The building is beautiful inside and out, and the grounds are stunning - there are so many places for beautiful photos, and views out over the countryside. The food was absolutely delicious, it was so hard to choose what to have! It was also so helpful to have so many places for guests to sit and chat in the evening, away from the disco room but still part of the action. Having so many bedrooms onsite (not to mention a stunning bridal suite!) was an added bonus. We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall highly enough, and have had so many comments from guests saying what a beautiful, elegant but relaxed day it was, so I know they really appreciated everything Bourton has to offer too. Thank you so much to Emily and the whole team for giving us such a perfect day!"
V65,Bourton Hall,"As the Bride and Groom we were made to feel like nothing was too much to ask and they couldn't do enough to make us feel special.
All the guests commented that it was one of the prettiest and most relaxed weddings they have been to.
We could not have asked for a better wedding day thanks to Bourton!"
V65,Bourton Hall,"I had my wedding on 10/02/2024 I am so happy I chose this venue, It is really magical. My wedding manager was just the best! Emily went above and beyond to help me on my big day! I cannot thank her enough.

One of the main things about this venue is that t has its own chappel which is really special and makes you wedding seem more traditional, however there are more options/ rooms available. I wanted the wow factor and I got it.

Some of the options that made it great

*Onsite accommodation for night before and night of the wedding is really helpful
*Exclusive use
*Dedicated wedding manager definate gamechanger! (Emily)
*Menu choices are fantastic.

Everyone commented on the food being really nice ( we had the lamb) The evening buffet was also great. I paid extra to have a meal created as having part of my culture within the food at the wedding was very important to me, they did not disappoint.
Emily was perfect in so many ways, she knew exactly my vision once i explained it to her and she made sure that it became real for me. She adapted parts of the day so that it would work better, for example bringing the canapes outside whilst photos where being taken. Helping me into my dress, looking after my phone just everything I needed she was there. She really worked hard to make sure it run perfectly and it did.

Thank you emily!!! You made my day Great."
V65,Bourton Hall,We got married at Bourton Hall on 30th July 2023. It was the most amazing day ever! We are still receiving compliments from our guests on how stunning the venue was and the whole running of the day. This was 100% down to our wedding co-ordinator Harminder. He went above and beyond to ensure our day was absolutely perfect. He literally could not have done any more! Thank you again Harminder!!
V66,B&H Buildings,Bourne & Hollingsworth was such an exceptional venue for our wedding this September. This is the perfect place for you if you want a true London wedding that feels like a fun dinner/house party but on an epic scale. We used the top floor (the studios) for our sit down dinner (think candle light and tasty roast lamb) and headed downstairs for our reception with the basement club (below and hidden) for late night dancing. The place is stunning (greenery and glass everywhere and the cocktails are insane but what really makes this place are the people. The whole staff from Matt and Lizzie to the bar team to the dinner crew made our whole day seamless and so fun. Could not recommend B&H more highly for your London wedding.
V66,B&H Buildings,"Beautiful wedding celebration in the most stylish venue - we had an intimate wedding reception (drinks, dinner and more drinks!) at the Bourne & Hollingsworth Buildings. The staff members on duty were excellent - nothing was too much trouble and they served everyone with such professionalism. We couldn’t recommend it highly enough and we haven’t stopped talking about it since. All of our guests were so impressed with the space and how stylish it was. The bar, restaurant and greenhouse are all aesthetically beautiful and the botanical vibes make for a very relaxed, but premium setting. Special shout out to Lizzie who helped us coordinate everything and Matt on the day who led the team. Thank you so much - we had the best day and we couldn’t have wished to host it in a better venue."
V66,B&H Buildings,"India & the B&H team were seamless. Flexible, responsive, kind, and easy to deal with. They made our day so special. The food was fantastic, the drinks were lovely, and the value for money was first rate!"
V67,Leez Priory,"I never in my life thought I would get married in a place like Leez priory! The whole experience from start to finish was just fantastic. The price breakdown was manageable and there was no pressure to take any upgrades offered. The things we got in our package were phenomenal and having a wedding planner was tremendous - our lady (Leanne) was an absolute god send!
They catered to all our needs and we were made to feel so comfortable and nothing was a problem! I’d highly suggest going to an event there before hand, just to get a feel of what it’s like full of people and enjoy their delicious food. We actually enjoyed their entertainer ( singer) so much we hired him for our wedding ☺️
Lee priory is just so beautiful. I can’t speak highly enough x"
V67,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory on the 7th of September 2024. Considering how long they have been a wedding venue, they were pretty flexible with some of the ideas we had for the venue styling that turned out amazingly!

The staff really made the day something special and couldn't have done enough for us. Special mention must be made for Leanne, our wedding planner, who was amazing!

Highly recommend the venue and the incredible team that helped to make our day so special!"
V67,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in October 2024. This venue is stunning both inside and out with immaculately kept grounds and interior. The hospitality in the lead up to and on the day of the wedding was fantastic. The food was also brilliant. Another great perk of this venue is the amount of on site accommodation.

A couple of drawbacks / experiences during our wedding. There are only a few toilets in the main building which kept blocking and overflowing throughout the evening which led to us taking some guests to the dressing room or honeymoon cottage to use the facilities. You are also restricted by the venue on any external food or drink suppliers and the venues optional extras for this are quite expensive for what they are.

That asaide, we had the best day and evening at Leez Priory and would certainly recommend it!"
V67,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in August 2024- great venue and experience from initial viewing to leaving the morning after the wedding. Leanne acted as our wedding planner and was friendly, professional and helpful throughout. We opted for the classic package and the food was amazing quality with everyone commenting how full they were!
The venue is beautiful with several options for ceremony both inside and out. Accommodation was great too. The whole day ran smoothly with perfect weather - we will have very happy memories of our day!"
V67,Leez Priory,"Perfect venue and very attentive staff, lovely food and great communication from start to finish"
V67,Leez Priory,"Stunning venue. Fantastic Team. Very accommodating toward our unique ""surprise"" strategy. Our guests were truly surprised. Thank you."
V67,Leez Priory,"Leez priory was the 1st and only venue we looked around when we started planning our wedding. From the moment we stepped on the premises, everything just looked so perfect and exactly what we wanted from a wedding venue. When we got assigned our wedding co-ordinator Rachel, she was just absolutely spot on with everything we asked for and nothing was too big an ask for her. She made sure the day ran as smoothly as possible and took care of any issue that arose without me knowing (which I am forever grateful for!!)
The rest of the staff were amazing and very helpful.

The venue itself is just absolutely stunning and we loved that it has the pub area as well as the dance floor so it catered to all of our guests.

All of the rooms were lovely and it was so nice being able to stay in the fisherman’s lodge onsite the night before the wedding.

We genuinely cannot recommend this venue enough and it was 100% worth the money! 10/10!"
V67,Leez Priory,"We got married on a Tuesday in October to maximise the value of what we could get for our money; and honestly, we got everything we wanted and more. Leanne, our Wedding Manager was perfect at bringing an attention to detail and seamless organisation to the big day, and in the lead up. There wasn't one moment of the day where we felt stressed, as Leanne had it covered. In one particular instance, our flowers for the bridal party's hair hadn't arrived. Within five minutes of telling Leanne that we needed this, the flowers were with our hair and make-up suppliers to add the finishing touches.

Leez Priory as a venue is the most stunning setting, and offers an incredible range of areas in which the ceremony and reception can take place. There is also the opportunity for the bridal party to make use of the Fisherman's Cottage the night before the wedding, and for people to stay in the on-site accommodation on the evening of the wedding, making it the perfect venue for people also travelling from further afield.

Leez Priory were very accommodating, welcoming and were happy to work with us to make our day as perfect as possible. The food was incredible, and a total hit with all of our guests, and so many people have commented on how incredible the day was as a whole. You wouldn't be disappointed to choose Leez Priory."
V67,Leez Priory,They catered to our every need. To when we would ask for things they hadn’t been done before they still made sure it went smoothly. Leanne was amazing she made me feel so comfortable from the start. The whole day was stunning. Beautiful venue please go view it as you will not be disappointed
V67,Leez Priory,We got married on the 26 May 2024. This venue was absolutely brilliant! They catered for every need and made sure there was no stress on the day. Leanne was kind and level headed throughout and was always one step ahead! Do not hesitate to book- do it now!
V68,London Rowing Club,"We picked this place because we wanted somewhere fairly central and casual. We fell in love with the long room and the view. Our wedding was in October so we thought we'd have it cosy but we ended up with a beautiful autumnal day so everyone was on the balcony. The fairy lights were perfect and the other rooms were great to avoid leaving. The staff was so friendly and accommodating that we would definitely recommend the venue.

The only thing that could have tainted the day is that after three visits and many emails, we were never told that the river floods (a lot). We were flexible with our day so if we knew this we would have built it into our day, instead, I was told by the photographer on the day as I got out of the taxi that we wouldn't be able to take any group photos because the area would be flooded during the cocktail hour and half that we had assigned as photo time. This would have been disappointing but we all ended up running outside after the ceremony to take photos before the tide came in. My husband and I borrowed wellies for our couple photos. We had fun doing this, but I can imagine many couples being upset! My friend's electric car also flooded and they were obviously upset."
V68,London Rowing Club,"Annabel was meticulous in her help planning the wedding. Very knowledgeable and helpful.
On the day the rest of the staff were brilliant - there wasn’t an empty glass in the house.
Great venue at a reasonable price on the London riverside."
V68,London Rowing Club,"LRC was the perfect place to celebrate our wedding this summer. The venue staff went above and beyond to ensure that everything went as planned both before and during the event. Thanks in particular to Annabel who was responsive, helpful and always put us at ease in the build up. The location is stunning - couldn’t have asked for a better day!"
V68,London Rowing Club,"We just wanted to say an enormous thank you for everything. From the moment we came to visit the LRC on a slightly grey January weekend, we knew it would be a fabulous venue for our June wedding reception and it certainly did not disappoint. It really is the most beautiful setting and we have very fond memories of our guests enjoying drinks in the sunshine with the most fantastic view over the Thames. The venue has such character and lends itself beautifully to a wedding reception. We have received so many compliments from our guests and I would encourage anyone thinking about booking their wedding at the LRC to do it, you will not regret it! We were lucky to be blessed with beautiful weather so were able to have our jazz musicians play on the balcony for the drinks reception before moving into the Long Room for our meal. It looked stunning with the tables dressed and mantles adorned with flowers. Following the meal and speeches, guests enjoyed drinks back on the balcony and in the Fairburn and Members Rooms which provide plenty of seating, whilst the Long Room was cleared and the band set up. We then partied the night away.

From start to finish, the organisation was so straight forward. Annabel was very accommodating and full of helpful advice in the run up. I knew that on the day she would ensure things ran like clock work, which of course they did. Our suppliers also commented on how helpful the LRC team were to work with. On the day the staff were brilliant and went out of their way to ensure everything ran smoothly (including borrowing some large gym fans from the rowers to put in the Long Room to keep us cool as it was an unexpectedly hot day). We really can’t thank you enough and now need to think of an excuse to host another party with you in the future!"
V68,London Rowing Club,"We got married in St. Mary's church and then had our reception in the London Rowing Club in February 2023. It far exceeded our expectations and was an incredible fabulous stress-free day with thanks to the wonderful Annabel making the day just run.

In the lead up to the event, Annabel was incredibly responsive, helpful and helped us plan the day exactly how we wanted it. She answered all our questions really quickly, always got back to us, was very flexible with what we could do and allowing us to personalise the space. Prior to the event, Annabel arranged for us to go and have a look around on a couple of additional occasions to help us plan how we would want it to look. She also gave our caterers a tour of the kitchens as they were new to the venue.

In the immediate lead up to the day, Annabel helped with our suppliers in getting chairs delivered and bringing all the wine over a day earlier. On the day, she helped to make the day flow and just dealt with things throughout the day.

The venue itself is beautiful with three rooms to use. A middle reception room, a cosy snug and the main long room. In the main long room, there is a rowing boat hanging upside down with fairly lights. The main lighting can be dimmed and gave a wonderful atmosphere for the evening meal. As our wedding was a winter wedding, it was fairly chilly so they lit fires in the main room and snug which added to the atmosphere.

We had around 90 guests - could have fitted a few more just about. We used the round tables, tablecloths, linen, plates cutlery and glasses provided and they were perfect for a wedding and looked very smart. No need to hire these. As mentioned, we did hire separate wedding chairs instead of the conference chairs provided. There's a lot of decoration in the way of rowing memorabilia on the walls which means you don't have to actually do too much to make it interesting for guests.

Overall, the perfect London wedding venue with absolutely fabulous views across the Thames with a long balcony to enjoy from. To top it off Annabel is truly amazing and so helpful."
V68,London Rowing Club,"We had our wedding (ceremony+reception) at LRC in July, and the venue itself and the team we worked with were absolutely incredible! Everything on the day went without a hitch and we heard so many compliments on the location - our guests loved the balcony and the layout inside, which included plenty of space for anyone wanting a break from dancing to sit down and relax. Would recommend to anyone looking to host an event!"
V68,London Rowing Club,"London Rowing Club is a truly fantastic venue and we were both so delighted with how our day went! The venue has real character with the classic rowing memorabilia and it’s location on the Thames, and looks amazing when it’s all set up. The layout and size of rooms I thought were perfect for our wedding of about 70 (+15ish more in the evenings) and of course the big attraction is the balcony which all of our guests adored!! (I wish I’d had more time during the day to stand out there and enjoy it 😂). Not only is it a fantastic venue in a great location but what really made this the most amazing venue was how great all of the staff, and all the recommend suppliers were! The day exceeded expectations and we got compliments on the place and the staff from all our guests. Couldn’t be happier with the venue, it was perfect for us!!"
V68,London Rowing Club,"We found the London Rowing Club while desperately combing through London locations after our original venue fell through a few months before the day.
Luckily for us it was available due to a cancellation - kismet!
From the start the charming Annabel put us very much at ease and helped us to envisage the day as we hoped it would be. She was very flexible and helpful throughout the planning process.
We were incredibly lucky with the weather on the day and the venue really came into its own - it was virtually impossible to get guests off the terrace, which is the perfect size for our smallish event (65 people) and of course offers gorgeous river views.
We were well looked after by the team and everything went off without a hitch. The interior of the space itself is lovely with a great sense of history.
Nice additional touch - table tennis was made available in the entry room for the later part of the evening!

It's a special place and I'd thoroughly recommend for anyone seeking a memorable spot to tie the knot!"
V68,London Rowing Club,"We got married at the London Rowing Club on a brilliantly sunny winter day on Saturday. All the way through in the run up (after 2 years or more of postponements), Annabel and team bent over backwards to help us arrange everything, recommended some brilliant suppliers for food (Shona Pollock comes highly recommended) and flowers (same with Steph the charityflorist.)

So many of our guests said how lovely the venue and staff were on the day, and the whole place looked a million dollars with an amazing photo set on and around the balcony and river - although we haven't seen those yet. The corkage and bar tariff prices are also incredibly reasonable for an inner London location!

I can't recommend the LRC highly enough. It will live in memory for a very long time."
V68,London Rowing Club,"The London Rowing Club team alongside the Dinner Ladies went above and beyond to ensure that we had the wedding perfectly fitting our requirements. Throughout the entire all of the suppliers worked seamlessly together to ensure the space transformed as we progressively added guests and transitioned between eating, our ceremony, more eating, music and dancing. We wouldn’t have had it any other way. The attention to detail of the team is second to none - perfect for any bride and groom seeking a beautiful event."
V69,The Prince Albert,"The team at The Prince Albert were always accommodating, made everything easy and stress-free, and helped us organise an amazing wedding party. They really knew what they were doing, and helped guide us through the process calmly, working around our schedule (which wasn't easy - we live abroad!) to make sure all our last-minute worries and concerns were sorted smoothly. The food was excellent, and the space was fantastic for our party. Can't recommend it highly enough!"
V69,The Prince Albert,"We had such a happy wedding with Harrison and this venue. Harrison was really flexible and answered any questions we had and made great suggestions when we needed seating arrangements, the schedule for the day, a florist, and more. The day was accessible to everyone and the food and drink were perfect. Thank you for making out wedding stress free and wonderful."
V69,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert was the most wonderful venue for our London wedding. We came across the venue at there wedding fair and chose alot of our suppliers from the same wedding fair.

Harrison and Lauren were always so on hand to help with any questions and did a fantastic job answering all of our questions. The staff were so friendly and helpful and made everything run like clockwork.

We couldn’t recommend The Prince Albert enough for a london wedding and would love to do it all again."
V69,The Prince Albert,"My wife and I were beyond happy with how everything went on our wedding day. Harrison, Diana, Claudio and the whole team were absolutely phenomenal! It was such a beautifully efficient operation, and we always felt like someone was there to help us when needed.

We've had dozens of compliments about the great food and how wonderfully intimate the venue was for a wedding. Some of our more traditional relatives said they were initially sceptical at the prospect of a pub wedding, but that it was one of the most beautiful and joyful weddings they’d been to. A friend of mine was also very happy that someone at the bar remembered her drink order throughout the evening! On top of that, everything ran perfectly to schedule, which is no doubt down to the high attention to detail.

It was very useful that the upstairs was free on Friday afternoon so that we could set up the space. It gave us plenty of time to do the flower arrangements, put up the bunting, and stick photos on the frame wall.

Thank you again so much for all the help and support you've given us - it really was the best day of our lives (so far)!"
V69,The Prince Albert,"My husband and I got married here in late September 2023, and I cannot recommend the Prince Albert enough!! Booking a wedding venue can be stressful and we felt like a lot of the venues we looked at gave us the ""hard sell"" but the folks at the Prince Albert helped to put us at ease every step of the way. We fell in love with how beautiful the pub was, so hired the upstairs for the ceremony, wedding breakfast and party afterwards for around 40 - 45 people. We were able to drop off decorations the night before and talk it all through with the staff, and they did such a good job of working with us and the florist to get the place looking amazing. The ceremony went off without a hitch, everybody loved the food and we had a blast in the evening. All the staff were amazing, but special shout out to Harrison and Lauren for helping us plan and run the day, and Maria for managing everything on the ground both when we dropped off the decorations and during the wedding itself. Thank you again for helping us celebrate our special day with our loved ones, for making it so stress free and so memorable!"
V69,The Prince Albert,"All you ever hear about wedding venues is that everything is a rip off, the food is meh, and there are a ton of annoying restrictions...the opposite is true of Harrison and The Prince Albert team. From Day 1, Harrison made the whole process not only easy but really fun! He was quick to respond, super knowledgeable, and very accommodating; he even helped our best man execute a surprise for us without it disrupting any timings. On the day, they decorated the place beautifully, managed to serve a 3 course dinner to 76 people unbelievably fast, and everyone raved about the food - to say they did a good job is a gross understatement, they went above and beyond. We were after ""classy fun"" and that's exactly what we got - thank you so so much!"
V69,The Prince Albert,"We had the exact wedding reception we wanted at the Prince Albert thanks to Harrison, Claudio and the other amazing staff who helped us feel so relaxed in the build up and during. We wanted a very low-key vibe and the team understood that but there were enough options for any style of wedding you wanted. The upstairs function room felt cozy and intimate while still leaving breathing room and space to dance, but you could easily rent the whole place if you wanted more guests and even choose to do your ceremony there. We had the most compliments on our food (we chose a buffet option). The team were particularly accomodating to some complicated dietary requirements and it was all delicious."
V69,The Prince Albert,"July 6, 2023 was the most memorable day of our lives! A big thank you to Harrison and the rest of the team for assisting us through out the whole process. Our guests loved the Prince Albert pub especially the sumptuous food and booze on our wedding day!

David & Dannah"
V69,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert is a Great venue for the classic Pub Wedding.
Harrison and the team did an amazing job to organize everything. The food was great and the service first class. Only sorry it was over so quickly. Thanks again for everything."
V69,The Prince Albert,"We found The Prince Albert when our original venue cancelled on us less than 2 months before our wedding. & we are so glad we did; everything happens for a reason! From the moment we met Harrison, we knew we were in safe hands, and the team at the Prince Albert made our day amazing. The pub looked beautiful and we were very greatful for the effort the team put in putting up all our decorations. We had so many compliments about the food, and we were very impressed in the swift and organised manner in whichever it was served. Everyone had a wonderful time, and we would not hesitate in recommending The Prince Albert."
V70,Kindred,"We chose Kindred for our 60 person wedding and it could not have been better. We wanted a venue where we could have the ceremony, dinner and dancing all under one roof, that was wheelchair accessible, and easy to get to on the tube, Kindred ticks all those boxes and more!
The food is incredible, we really enjoyed popping by to do all the tastings, we'll continue to come to the Cellar for food and cocktails. Many guests commented on how good the food was.
The place itself is gorgeous, inside and out. We used the whole venue, the main Hall for the ceremony, dinner and dancing, and the Library upstairs for the drinks reception and cake cutting. Also, being right next to Hammersmith station, the venue could not be easier to get to!
The staff are wonderfully attentive and helpful, both before and on the day. They were really open to the little details that made our day uniquely ours, from the drinks selections, to having a table and glasses on stage for the ceremony, to playing our music selections at the right time. Plus its a dog friendly venue!"
V70,Kindred,"We LOVE this venue! We got married here with only 12 weeks notice and Anna, the owner, and her staff went above and beyond to make the day as memorable, magical, and marvellous as we'd hoped it would be. The venue is elegant, stylish and perfect for a London, city based wedding. The food is sensational as it comes from their in-house kitchen on the ground floor and every guest remarked on how delicious their meal was. It's restaurant quality food, not your standard wedding food. The place looks stunning in all our wedding photos and the wedding cake they made us (at very short notice I might add!) was second to none. Everyone loved it. The venue was also perfect for late night dancing and drinking and merriment. It was such a pleasure - and a breeze - to work with Anna and her team on one of the most important days of my life, and I very much hope to do so again in the future. I will forever be grateful to her and all she helped us with."
V70,Kindred,"We had our wedding reception for 35 guests at Kindred, in the Library and Salon earlier this year. The day went incredibly smoothly, the staff couldn't have been more attentive and our guests raved about the food for weeks afterwards. It was the perfect sized space for our intimate celebration, really cosy and the atmosphere was great. The little touches really helped to make the day special, with espresso martinis served for the speeches and sparklers for our exit at the end of the night. Thanks again to the lovely Kindred team!"
V70,Kindred,"I cannot find a single fault in our experience with Kindred for our wedding. Not only was it a stunning venue that honestly made some of our guests gasp as they arrived, but Anna and the team were so incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. Having them support us really took so much of the wedding planning stress away and we knew we were in safe hands. I really appreciated that the team were happy to chat through ideas with me and were always keen to find creative solutions to give us the day that we had envisioned.

The food was absolutely delicious and they were so accommodating for our long list of dietary requirements from our guest. The cocktails were also so delicious. Our guests were buzzing for weeks after, as were we.

On the night, the staff were not only incredibly helpful and efficient, but also just so friendly, welcoming and complimentary. We felt thoroughly spoilt and very well looked after.

We visited so many venues and this was by far the best choice for us. The interiors made for some stunning photos and the layout of the spacing meant that whilst we had 80-100 guests, it still felt very intimate. I cannot recommend Kindred enough!"
V70,Kindred,"We would give a thousand stars if we could. Kindred hosted us for our cocktail style wedding and it was everything we could have hoped for and the perfect venue for this style of wedding. The wine, cocktails and food (incredible grazing board, canapés, bowls and pizzas) were exceptional and the team were on top of everything, friendly and nothing was ever an issue. We would HIGHLY recommend it. We have had loads of guests message us to tell us what a spectacular venue it was with the most friendly team. The venue had different spaces to suit our needs and the AV is amazing - it worked perfectly for our live music band and our DJ, and our own music playlists for our ceremony. They took the stress off planning and really did mean we could relax and not worry that everything would run smoothly. Thank you so much Kindred team for giving us the best day of our lives"
V71,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The best day of our lives and me and my now husband couldn't be more thankful to Bredenbury. Before booking Bredenbury we visited over 17 wedding venues in Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Herefordshire - we fell in love instantly, there is no need for a crazy amount of extra expense on decorations, the venue speaks for itself. The fact that it was no corkage just added to why we wanted to book and the team were so friendly. In the lead up to the wedding they were brilliant, we booked far in advance and brought over all our family members to come see the venue, they were so flexible, understanding and welcoming - they couldn't do enough for us. On the wedding day they had decorated for us by the time we had arrived and all we had to do on the day was to enjoy it - which was perfect. It really was the best day of our lives, all the comments from our family and friends was how beautiful the venue was. They kept the day running so smooth and we didn't need to think about a thing."
V71,Bredenbury Court Barns,"There truly aren't words to describe how incredible Bredenbury Court Barns and their entire team of fantastic staff were through the planning process and the day itself. They were so friendly, supportive and nothing was ever too much. From quick replies to any questions that popped to mind to planning meetings that left us feeling prepared and ready to the day being set up beyond perfectly. Our amazing wedding coordinator Lianna spent the days and months (years really!) leading up to our big day making sure everyone detail was perfect, that everything was incorporated that we'd dreamed of and made sure we didn't feel a moment of stress from start to finish. All throughout the building from the bridal booth, to the orangery to the oak barn was beautifully light and open - even with our wedding being the end of October - and we had so many compliments about this! There aren't enough words to say thank you and explain just how much we'd recommend this venue to everyone"
V71,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We had the perfect day back in July. The weather didn't go to plan but they helped make the day so special even with the last minute switches because of the rain. We had such an amazing day and the feedback from our guests about the venue, food and service was great! We cannot thank the team enough for the effort they put in throughout the whole process but especially on the day. We felt incredibly supported throughout the whole process."
V71,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The venue itself is stunning. The buildings, grounds and interior decorations are all beautiful and immaculately presented. From the moment you turn down the lane it is so picturesque, you know you've found somewhere special. It's exactly what we were imagining for our wedding venue.

The layout is perfect, with ample space for guests to mingle and move about, and great accessibility for older and disabled guests. Ours was a winter wedding, and while most of the day was inside it wasn't cramped and we could still enjoy the beautiful grounds through the expansive windows that run along the whole barn.

All of the venue is stunning, but practicality-wise the Bridal Suite warrants a special mention. Room length mirrors, plenty of room for the bridal party to get ready, have their makeup and hair done, and if there's time to relax as well. Drinks were served from 11 onwards, and it has it's own toilets and shower.

From our first meeting at Bredenbury the staff were exceptional. They gave a reassuring air of professionalism and experience, with just the right level of excitedness for our day without it feeling forced. We were really impressed by how responsive the whole team were, with speedy replies to any questions we had during the planning. This is something we particularly appreciated as we only gave ourselves 7 weeks to plan our big day.

Value for money wise it felt tricky to gauge when we were trying to choose a venue as the headline figure is rarely what you'll end up paying, with different venues charging different amounts for different things. Not the case with Bredenbury. With their No Corkage policy and generosity in being able to use whatever props they already have, any extras were non-essentials of our own choosing.

No Corkage is pretty significant. Some venues wanted to charge £20/bottle, so not having to pay this and being able to supply not only our own wine but beers, gin and soft drinks for the drinks reception and wedding breakfast was not only a massive saving but also made the occasion more personal for us. The bar staff and catering team were excellent, pouring and serving drinks, warming our mulled wine and setting up the gin bar. Once your guests have drunk you dry the venue's bar is well stocked and standard pub pricing.

We wanted a Christmas wedding and seeing in early November that they had a date available that December we couldn't resist. 7 weeks isn't long to organise a wedding with nearly 100 guests, and we couldn't have done it without the Bredenbury team being so organised. Our assigned event manager, Harriet, was brilliant in the runup and on the day, as were all the other managers and staff we spoke with. The Wedding Bible they fill out with you is a great idea and nails down all the finer details to ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible on the day.

We didn't want to have to spend the day before and morning of our wedding worrying about set up and decorations, but needn't have worried as Bredenbury did all of this for us. A meeting beforehand clarified what we wanted where; we simply dropped off boxes of stuff the day before and rocked up in the morning to find everything laid out as hoped.

This organisation extended to the third party suppliers, of which Bredenbury have an extensive list of local recommendations. We booked the ceiling lights with Cotswold Wedding Co. and didn't have to do anything else. The band, Apollo Gold (incredible!!) set up without any hassle and didn't have any issues with Bredenbury's noise limiter. Our florist Katrina Bevis hadn't been there before, but again had no problem getting everything in place on the morning.

On-site accommodation was good for close family and friends, but there's not enough for the majority of guests and the lack of a dedicated honeymoon suite is a bit of a shame. If you want privacy for your first night as a married couple it means taking over an entire lodge. The quality and comfort of the rooms is excellent, though, and the continental breakfast served the morning after in the East Lodge was delicious, with ample options for Vegan and Gluten Free.

Jenkinsons are the exclusive caterer for Bredenbury and have an extensive menu for nibbles, the wedding breakfast and dinner. The menu and ordering process is clear, and pricing is what we expected to pay. Food and service was as slick and faff-free as everything else. A real delight.

On the day, Harriet and the catering manager were absolute superstars. Zero stress, everything ran to time and as planned, and they were always available if we had any questions or needed help.

The whole day was perfect and exactly what we wanted. I don't think we could have achieved this without the exceptional organisation of Harriet and the team. The entire process was very slick, zero stress, and we wouldn't hesitate in recommending Bredenbury Court Barns to anyone looking to get married in a countryside paradise."
V71,Bredenbury Court Barns,"I want to say a massive thank you to Bredenbury Court Barns for hosting our wedding. From the start they were super amazing and accommodating to us. They won us over with their care and support even when we had a pickle in the beginning.

Olivia was super helpful from the start and throughout the year we were planning she offered huge amount of support and suggestions.

We typed in “orangery weddings” in google when we were first looking because I was keen to get a ceremony in an orangery and Bredenbury popped up after much searching. Once we saw the Orangery we cancelled every other viewing we had across the country because we felt we found the perfect place, and nothing compared to the reception with the beautiful windows that brought all the light in. The grounds were absolutely spectacular and gorgeous. It was a no brainer for us to pick such a beautiful venue. They brought my ideas to life and we were able to get support on anything from recommendation of suppliers, to ideas on decor to their favourite meals from Jenkinson’s. They fully outdid themselves in love for us. We can’t forget it.

Our wedding day was exceptional with Lianna helping us all the way. She was a breath of fresh air. She cared about all the little details and made us feel relaxed and had a good laugh with us. The fact she was there 100% of the way, before the wedding, during the wedding, and even after is unmatched! Thank you Lianna for really being there to make our wedding day smooth and relaxing.

The food was incredible too and we often think about how sad it is that we didn’t finish our second plates, we think about it a lot.

Thank you for the wonderful journey BCB, you blew us away with your integrity, kindness, and genuine support!"
V71,Bredenbury Court Barns,thank you to everyone at bredenbury court barns who made our day so special
V71,Bredenbury Court Barns,"From the moment we stepped foot into Bredenbury Court Barns, we knew this was the venue for us. It was the first and only venue we viewed as we were blown away by how gorgeous the venue is. The venue itself is absolutely stunning, with breathtaking views and impeccably maintained grounds that set the perfect backdrop for our special day.

The staff went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. From our first consultation to the last dance, their professionalism and attention to detail were exceptional. Harriet was absolutely brilliant and I don’t know what we would have done without her!

The food was another highlight—our guests are still talking about how delicious everything was! Jenkinsons are amazing, they helped us personalise our menu perfectly!

We couldn’t have asked for a more beautiful venue to have our wedding. The day couldn’t have been more perfect! Thank you to everyone at Bredenbury Court Barns for making our wedding day nothing short of magical!"
V71,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We could not have had a more perfect experience with Bredenbury Court Barns. Right from initial booking all the way through to breakfast the following morning, everything was perfect. Nothing was too much trouble for our wonderful planner, Lianna. She ensured the day ran smoothly and our months of planning turned out exactly as we’d imagined. They are available to answer any questions you have any time, they’re only an email away and get back to you so fast. The venue itself if just gorgeous, the grounds make for some wonderful photos, and the orangery lets so much light in that your ceremony photos are gorgeous. The whole place is fully air conditioned too which was great for our July wedding. The bridal suite is a perfect balance of being aesthetically pleasing and practical for getting ready in, it’s so spacious, lots of natural light, there’s plenty of plug sockets and huge mirrors so everyone has plenty of room for getting ready and no one is on top of eachother. There’s even an outside space for getting some fresh air. I’m so glad we chose to have our wedding here, it’s given us memories to cherish forever and there are zero memories of any stress!! Cannot recommend this venue enough!"
V71,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We cannot believe how lucky we fell to get married at such a beautiful venue. Right from the offset of viewing the venue, to our special day, we were taken of. No question was too silly, and so much pressure was taken off us during the planning. We managed to make everything our own and Lianna was there every step of the way. Thank you for giving us our happily ever after. We will forever be grateful."
V71,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We loved our wedding at Bredenbury the team did an amazing job providing everything we asked for and more. We especially liked that our wedding coordinator for the day, Harriet had thought of everything for us she went above and beyond and even offered to go and get my mum some more shoes when hers broke! absolute 5-star service and the food was amazing too!"
V72,art'otel London Battersea Power Station,N/A
V73,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow what can I say, Brinsop is an absolutely stunning wedding venue with heaps of character and so many options of places for the ceremony and to do things. We fell in love with it as soon as we saw it and knew it was where we wanted to get married.

Right from the start, the Brinsop team were so helpful and accommodating. From giving an virtual tour then showing us around in person, Issy and the team were fantastic right the way through. Nothing was a hassle, no request too difficult and they were incredibly professional and responsive throughout the whole process.

We loved that Brinsop is an exclusive venue with accommodation on site so we could stay with the bridal party and our immediate family. All the rooms are unique and have so much character and it's fun exploring the whole place. You feel like you are in the middle of nowhere, in nature with swans, ducks and birds all around.

Throughout our planning process, Issy and the team helped us every step of the way, being incredibly flexible in managing our requests and really trying to create our vision. They even got their team to make a giant jenga that we could use on the day! They helped to create the most perfect bespoke wedding breakfast and canapes menu, and seemed so positive and excited to be part of our special day and experience.

Arriving at the venue, Issy and the team were ready and had everything prepared and ready to go. It made the process so smooth for us and meant we could really enjoy the day without any stress. Issy coordinated perfectly with all of our vendors and it really felt like she and the whole team were so happy for us and wanted to be part of our day which was amazing. Our guests commented on how friendly and responsive all the staff were and it really made the experience extra special.

I wouldn't change anything about the day and it was perfect. I would absolutely recommend Brinsop as a wedding venue and all the staff who are really invested in helping deliver your vision. Thank you so so much to the whole team for making this a day that we will look back on for many years to come with amazing memories."
V73,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow, what a perfect day we had! It really went without a hitch and that was thanks to Nina and all the staff at Brinsop. The team worked seamlessly to ensure the day was as perfect as could be, and it really was! The wedding was booked over 2 years in advance and the staff were so accommodating with all my questions, planning and site visits, they couldn’t do more to support us. Special thanks to our coordinator Nina who was a delight to work with and a credit to Brinsop. Everyone that attended agreed at how beautiful the venue and grounds were, it was a wedding people won’t forget! 10/10 would recommend to anyone!"
V73,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"It's taken me quite a while to get round to writing this review, because sadly it's quite a bittersweet one.

We were married last year on 15 June and Brinsop was our chosen venue for both our ceremony and reception. We were first attracted to brinsop by the accomodation, meaning our loved ones could stay on-site, especially my grandparents which was so important to me.

The home itself is absolutely beautiful, including ivy cottage which myself and my mum stayed in the night before the big day. It really was a picture perfect setting, and looking down from the bridal suite seeing the ceremony space being set up on the Wordsworth lawn was honestly magical. Id dreamed of an outdoor wedding on that lawn, and we were so grateful the weather cleared so we could have it. The team really did wait till the latest they could to ask us to make a call on an inside or outside wedding (despite being June, it was a gloomy day to start) which I really appreciated!

Another amazing part of hiring brinsop was the after hours space we were able to enjoy until 2am with our house guests. The games room was absolute fantastic and meant that if you wanted to go to bed you could, but you could also stay up, party and play pool. I really do think this was a highlight for our guests and would recommend massively if you can spare some budget.

On the night of the wedding, myself and my new husband actually stayed in one glamping tents which we absolutely loved. The groundsman was on site until we were ready to leave the games room, and he then took us up to our tent in one of the buggies, making sure we had plenty of blankets and even stopping off for some bottles of water for us. This was really special, and can't thank him enough.

Hugo Spritz!! Having hugos at both our welcome drinks and drinks reception after the ceremony was amazing. I'm not a fan of prosecco myself and Mark and the team made it possible for us to have Hugo's all round. We even sneaked some up to the bridal suite to have before the ceremony (thanks Nadia!). Our guests loved them, and the amount of people that have told me they now need them at their own wedding is crazy!

Onto the not so good - sadly it all started to go a little downhill when we moved things into the knot barn for our wedding breakfast. Sitting on the top table, I could see that guests at the top of the second rows of long tables didn't really even have a seat around the table and were just kind of plonked on. The seating plan hadn't been followed, and I don't think there were even enough tables laid for the service to be comfortable for people because there was a dance floor at the end of the barn (which I did not ask for).

It was quickly also brought to my attention, that one of our guests had had to put her child on her lap in order to remove the high chair so people had more space. We also lost about 5 napkins with them setting on fire from the candles because everything was just way too cramped.

I asked to speak to catering, and asked if there was anything that they could do. I was told 'well sure, if you want the whole thing to be late'. In truth I shouldn't have even had to broach this myself, as it should have been sorted by the coordination team.

The tables weren't changed, even after they'd said they'd sort after the first course and yet the whole meal still ran late. We've had so much feedback about people not having enough food, food not being easy to access on the sharing platters etc and honestly when you've waited so long for a day and had spent 25k on the venue and food alone, it really has been heartbreaking to hear. I do sometimes question why people still bring it up (even now, people talk about the dining) when it clearly upset me so much.

Whilst writing this review my husband asked my what we had for evening food - we didn't get any. It was left unannounced on a back table. I don't know what I was expecting, just not that.

The next morning, the houseguests were asked to come down to breakfast for 9am (it was on a note in the room) but as we were in the glamping area, we walked past the knot barn just before 8.30 and the food was already out. We ran down to the house to hurry everyone up, and by which time everyone arrived it had been sitting there for 20plus mins going cold.

My biggest upset was that when I fed all of the above back to brinsop, feeling pretty deflated about the catering, I was told they'd pass my feedback on and heard absolutely nothing back. 25k total with over 10k on food and drinks to hear absolutely nothing, and this was 9 months ago. I'm not saying this in would happen to anyone else, but really - it shouldn't have happened to us either."
V73,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our wedding! From start to finish, everything at Brinsop was flawless. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most magical backdrop for our special day. Our guests were blown away by the beautiful venue, the warm atmosphere, and the seamless coordination. Every detail was taken care of, and we felt so well looked after. The team was incredible, professional, friendly, and attentive. On the day itself, they ensured everything ran smoothly, allowing us to truly enjoy every moment. A special mention goes to our amazing wedding coordinator Nina!"
V73,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We had our wedding on New Year's Eve 2024 at Brinsop, and it was more perfect that we could have ever hoped for. The venue itself is stunning, with beautiful spacious rooms which slept over 40 of our guests. Our coordinator, Nina, was incredible and so supportive on the day - she kept everything running so smoothly and everything went by without a glitch. The food and drink managers Mark and Amy did the most incredible job - nothing was ever too much, they were so attentive, and the chefs the most stunning meal after we gave them a fairly vague brief of 'curry'! We had the most perfect day and we're so incredibly grateful to Brinsop and the team."
V73,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,Brinsop Court is pure magic—an unforgettable venue with an incredible team!
V73,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We were lucky enough to have our wedding at Brinsop Court in December, and it was an absolutely spectacular day. We fell in love with Brinsop as soon we set our eyes on the beautiful manor and surrounding gardens. Cate, Amy, Mark and the rest of the wonderful staff at Brinsop really go the extra mile to make you feel special, and are extremely flexible with requests in order to make your day feel more special. We honestly felt like there was no request too big leading up to the day and they really made us feel extremely comfortable leading up to the day.
On the day, Cate and her team were well on hand to help us with setting up everything and she had everything under control when there were a few hiccups. The day itself was absolutely magical, and that wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for everyone at Brinsop working extremely hard to ensure that everything went to plan and as smoothly as it could.
Thank you to everyone at Brinsop for making us feel at ease and ensuring that our wedding was an amazing day."
V73,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Brinsop, the perfect wedding venue! We got married at Brinsop in December and I can honestly say it was everything we could have hoped for and more. We found out about the venue through Hitched and was one of only two venues that we visited but as soon as we got the house we knew it was the one. We fell in love with everything about it and it was fair to say that our guests agreed with us with many saying it was the nicest venue they’d been to. We had the wonderful Nina as our coordinator and she was brilliant! Nothing was too much trouble and we had constant communication with her in the build up which helped our stress levels no end. The same can be said for all of the staff who were brilliant throughout and allowed us to have the best day of our lives with everything running seamlessly. A special mention must be given to Amy and the catering staff who put on such an incredible menu (including the tasting session that provided some of the best food we’d ever had) and ensured that the food has been one of the main things that people have mentioned to us since the wedding! We had our ceremony in the Banqueting Hall which provided the perfect setting, especially with it being a winter wedding, as it really added to the cosy atmosphere and the lounge areas/games room were perfect for the drink’s reception. We would have loved to have also had it in the courtyard, but the temperatures meant that the lounge with the fireplace was a far more appealing option on the day. We then had the wedding breakfast and reception in the knot barn which was decorated beautifully and was the perfect place for the party in the evening. Overall we really can’t thank everyone at Brinsop enough for making our day what it was, we can honestly say that we have been made to feel part of the family and already can’t wait to hopefully come back to stay in one of the cottages for our first anniversary!"
V73,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Where do I start!!
Brinop Court is the most stunning venue, it was the first venue we visited and instantly fell in love! Theres so much history to the house and we were treated like family every time we visited before the wedding and it literally felt like home the whole weekend of the wedding, my guests also agreed!!

A special thank you to Issy our coodinator who went above and beyond ti make sure everything was perfect for us. It was so easy to plan and nothing was too much to ask, even arranging our dog to be our ring bearer!! When they say Brinsop is dog friendly they really mean it!!!

What a place, what a day!! Thank you so much everyone, you all made our day perfect and it really was the best day of our lives♥️"
V73,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We got married at the gorgeous Brinsop in October this year. It’s hard to put into words how amazing the whole experience was. We honestly had the best day of our lives!!!

We fell in love with Brinsop during our first visit back in December 2022. We knew almost immediately that Brinsop was the venue we were looking for! From the outside the venue looked like a painting - from the picturesque views of the countryside, to the swans swimming on the moat! The manor house itself has so much character, and has a lovely homely feel to it as you walk around it. Our guests were equally blown away by the venue!

A big thing for us was that it’s dog friendly, which meant we could have our two dogs join us on our special day, it wouldn’t have been the same without them there! They had so much fun walking around the grounds and greeting all of our guests!

Nina, our coordinator, and her team were always available to answer any of our questions in the run up to the day. This really put us at ease, knowing we were in safe hands. On the day, Nina and the team made sure everything ran smoothly and went above and beyond to ensure our guests were looked after. A shout out to Amy who heads up catering and Mark who manages the bar. The food and drinks were absolutely fantastic!

I highly recommend this venue! There’s a reason Brinsop is an award winning venue - and when you visit it’s not hard to see why. We are already looking forward to going back there for a date night next year! Thanks for everything Team Brinsop!

V74,The Manor at Bickley,"The Manor is the perfect venue for weddings! When our wedding venue fell through 4 months before the big day, I stumbled onto the Manor at Bickley and spoke to Craig. He was most helpful and kind and went above and beyond to make sure our wedding went ahead.

We hired the venue for our two day wedding and the staff were helpful and accommodating from start to finish. All of our guests were awed by the beautiful well kept grounds and the excellent service. We can’t thank the staff enough for making our wedding dreams a reality. They thought of every detail from bringing us champagne after our civil ceremony to making sure we had our card box at the end of the night! We are excited to head back to celebrate our anniversary there!"
V74,The Manor at Bickley,"Myself and my Husband chose this venue for our wedding last week and we can’t sing The Manor’s praises enough. From our very first enquiry, to the first viewing of the venue, right though until the big day, the staff at the manor have been nothing short of brilliant! Each staff member we came across was polite and accommodating. Special mention to Craig and Vicky with whom we did most of our liaising throughout the months leading up until our wedding. Craig and Vicky were super helpful, responsive and went above and beyond to make sure that we could have the day of our dreams. Even with last minute changes due to the weather, Craig who was just incredible throughout, managed to help us sort a backup plan so our day would still go ahead seamlessly.

The rooms at the manor were spacious and modern, giving us and our wedding party lots of space for photographers and videographers to capture the special moments on our wedding morning.

The lodge that was used for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready was fabulous. The manor was very flexible in giving us early access so we could get ready on time.

The grand marquee was definitely grand! Very spacious and when decorated looked like something out of a fairytale! lots of kitchen space, a huge bar and fantastic overhead speakers for the party!

The manor was super flexible to our needs regarding access, start times, outsourcing our vendors and much more. The venue is beautiful and spacious with options for outdoor and indoor events and entertainment. The grounds were absolutely beautiful, so many lovely spots for photos not only for us as the bride and groom but for guests too!

A very special thank you to our point of contact throughout, Craig. From our first meeting, he was charming, bubbly and made us feel super welcome. He reassured us that he has experience in African/Caribbean weddings and that our wedding day would amazing and it was. He was attentive and always let us know that he was only a phone call or e-mail away and was always quick to respond and answer any questions we had.

All in all, we had the most beautiful day at The manor and we would definitely recommend this venue for a wedding or other events.

V74,The Manor at Bickley,"We hired The Manor at Bickley for my daughters wedding. Got a brilliant service from the venue. Everything was set accordingly, as per floor plan. Our guests were loved the venue grounds/facilities and the overall wedding set up.
Thank you to everyone at Bickley."
V74,The Manor at Bickley,"A warm and friendly service from the very helpful staff, a feeling that it is your own house! The food was amazing and the atmosphere made us and our guests feel fantastic."
V75,Davenport House,We are so pleased we chose Davenport House for our wedding reception. Charley and the team were so helpful and thoughtful. Putting canapés behind the bar for us and making sure everything ran so smoothly. I am obsessed with the stunning house and grounds and it was absolutely perfect! Thank you so much for making our day so special!!
V75,Davenport House,"Davenport House is a STUNNING wedding venue so how could we not have it for our big day!?

The staff were exceptional! From the moment we booked through to our big day, we had an absolute blast and could not thank each member of staff enough! Special shout out to Jared (hopefully spelt right, haha!) who made sure we were fed, watered and ensured we took 5 minutes to ourselves every moment we could - Also even saved us slices of pie wedding cake before we went to bed!

Our guests have said they have never been to a wedding so spectacular, with the most amazing food and amazing staff so could not have been happier having Davenport as our venue! 🩷"
V75,Davenport House,"I just wanted to write to say a huge, enormous thank you to Charley and all the team at Davenport House. We still can’t believe how perfect our day was, and lots of our guests have told us it’s the best wedding they’ve ever been to. The team were all a huge part of making that happen. It was incredibly seamless and well planned on the day, meaning we genuinely didn’t have to think about a thing, except for enjoying ourselves. The day ran to schedule perfectly and even certain touches we didn’t know or expect to happen were planned by you and the team, which made the day even more special. Thank you so much for giving us our dream wedding day. We can’t wait to see the full set of pictures and the video now to relive it all!"
V75,Davenport House,"Without doubt the best day of our lives. From start to finish, Davenport has exceeded expectations. From the very first impression of the venue during the open day, the incredible food tasting evening, all the way through to the day itself, including the support and preparation leading up to it. It was really important to us to pick a venue that not only ticked the fairytale box, but also come with the complete support of a wedding planner, due to our busy jobs. We were lucky enough to have Charley as ours. She really took the time to listen and get to know us, to ensure the day was tailored to exactly what we wanted. We even had our own cocktail designed, which went down an absolute storm on the day! She considered every little detail, constantly putting our minds at ease, which made the whole process so easy and enjoyable. Honestly the day couldn’t have gone smoother, any anxiety or stress faded immediately as soon as we got to the venue. It was simply perfect. So many of our guests were complimentary of just how beautiful the venue is and just how well organised the day was, and that is the perfect way to summarise Davenport. Any prospective couples thinking of selecting Davenport as their venue, hesitate no further. It will be a day you never knew was possible! We cannot thank you enough Charley and the Davenport team, if only we could live the day over and over again"
V75,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was amazing. When looking for a venue we weren't just looking for something wow, we needed to have people who were enthused and passionate about their work - we found that at Davenport House.

From our first phone call & meeting with Lizzie and Tallulah, we knew this was the place for us. Having two brides wasn’t an issue; combining British, Asian and Spanish cultures - wasn't an issue; having brides enter together – wasn’t an issue. Nothing was an issue. At Davenport House, we got it all – a picturesque venue and the best team of staff anyone could ever wish for. All our external suppliers have commented what a fantastic venue you are. All out guests have said that the service and attention to detail was second to none. The thoughtful touches like hiring a Spanish speaking waiter for the table which spoke very little English ensured that everyone felt welcomed. Guests with dietary requirements didn't feel they got a second rate meal or they were an afterthought - the food for all throughout the day was exceptional. The rooms / cottages where our guests and we stayed, spotless and comfortable. The thought behind adding some cheese and Spanish ham to the morning breakfast - so sweet!

Special shout out to Megan - wedding planner extraordinaire who kept in touch throughout the planning process and was exceptional on the day. Ian who worked tirelessly to ensure the day ran smoothly and the food was perfect, Charley who was also in charge of one bride and ensuring that everything was on point. All the staff were fantastic - polite, professional and personal.

Everyone keeps saying that this was the best wedding they have ever attended and that’s a lot of weddings between people! When we asked why, they say things like ‘the venue’, ‘the staff’, but it all came back to the inclusivity, love & joy that they felt – and you were all a part of that.

Davenport House is a stunning venue made even better by those who work there. If you want the whole package on your wedding day, we strongly recommend you book them.

Thank you to the entire Davenport House team.

Sat and Ana xx"
V75,Davenport House,"Where to begin with our beautiful venue and thanking the people who made it all happen! We got married in November at Davenport House and it was easily the best day of our lives. We chose Davenport because we wanted to host our cosy winter wedding in a big grand house in the country, with all the grandeur and class but to still feel like an intimate celebration with our family and closest friends, and it was perfect in delivering just that. It is utterly beautiful, the location was perfect and exactly what we wanted. The food was absolutely AMAZING, we had so many compliments from our guests and we are so grateful for the team in delivering such a fabulous wedding breakfast. Thank you so much to Lizzie who couldn’t do more to help us have our dream day, and Ian who delivered the best service to us and our guests (the pizza at 2am was very much appreciated)

Massive massive thank you to Charley our wedding planner, who was so so helpful throughout our wedding planning process and on the day, I can’t thank her enough. She was always there whenever I needed her, helped me so much with creating our dream day and I will be forever grateful to her for keeping me sane! Whenever I had any worries I knew she was just a phone call away, which helped me a lot when planning a wedding!

Charley, Lizzie and Ian thank you for everything - best team ever. Our day was seamless and it was all down to you and your incredible team.

Jess and Sam xx"
V75,Davenport House,"Me and my (now) wife chose Davenport House as our wedding venue in mid 2022, to get married in September 2023, and it was the best decision we could have made. We looked at a range of Georgian style manor house type venues located in Cheshire, North Wales and the West Midlands areas. It blew all of the competition away in terms of the venue aesthetics, the balance in design (i.e. period characteristics vs modern design), the impressive condition of the property for its age plus what it offered for our wedding weekend.

Staff and service - In the UK, this is usually something that is average at best - if you're lucky. At Davenport House, the service from all staff was 10/10. I honestly don't think we've ever had better service for anything. We had a wedding planner from the start (Megan), who was an absolute saint and was fundamental in making the whole wedding a success. She was also instrumental in helping us find a way for our 'little' dog Bernie to be a part of the main event. Thanks Megan!

Accommodation - The fantastic condition, design and decor for Davenport House extends to all areas of the estate. The rooms are fantastic, very big, well maintained and cleaned religiously by the venue. We had no issues or problems from all of the guests who stayed onsite over the 3 days.

Food and drink - This got a lot of deserved praise from the guests too. We got to tailor our entire menu and it worked perfectly for what we wanted for the 3 days. The oyster bar and luxurious charcuterie board went down particularly well the day before the wedding.

I could keep writing much, much more on how fantastic this venue was for our wedding. But the best advice I could give for any interested couples is to go and visit it in person and reach out to Davenport House with any questions. Our own wedding ended up becoming both perfect and the best wedding we've ever been to. Thanks guys again!"
V75,Davenport House,"Fantastic location.
Great staff.
Beautiful place to get married.
I can wait to film here again soon thanks for having me."
V75,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was a fairytale, everything we could have dreamed of and more. Lizzie and Charley were fantastic in their support, organisation and professionalism in planning our wedding. The venue is simply spectacular- breathtaking. Our guests were blown away. The day ran so smoothly it was simply perfect. The food was out of this world our guests couldn't get enough. All the staff at the house went above and beyond to ensure we were happy and having a great day. The team were also extremely supportive of last minute changes/additions. The Davenport experience was truly wonderful and I'm sad to see it end right from our initial meetings, food tasting and finally our special day. Thank you: Lizzie, Charley, Ian and all of the team for a truly memorable day for us and our guests. Mr and Mrs Kissane"
V75,Davenport House,"We got married at Davenport House in February and they provided us with the most perfect day. Lizzie, Charley, Ian and the rest of the team were the best hosts we could have hoped for. Nothing was too much to ask and the guests all commented on the hospitality shown to them. The setting is utterly gorgeous, our weather was less than favourable so we did not make the most of the grounds but this didn't matter, the house was setting enough and so atmospheric! The food was utterly AMAZING and better than most restaurant food I have eaten. The venue feels intimate and grand at the same time.
I literally cannot recommend this place enough, they gave us the wedding we had always wanted and more!"

V77,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge on 12 May 2023 and it was incredible. The views are gorgeous and the photo opportunities are endless with beautiful floral and green surroundings. The team were super responsive throughout the process which is really reassuring and helpful when planning a wedding, and Nelson who ran the day was just fantastic. Every single detail was thought of and they run a really slick operation. This is essential as it meant I had a lot less to think about! They put me and my partner at ease throughout. The food and service on the day was fantastic, so many of our guests said this was the best food they’ve ever had at a wedding. Highly recommend! (Photos by Costa Weddings UK)"

V77,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge in October 2024. The whole day was magical, including the beautiful view over the autumn trees in Richmond Park. Robert made sure everything ran perfectly and helped us to find slots in the busy wedding timetable to fit in some special moments to also reflect traditions from my husband's Dutch culture. The food was great and the staff were polite and fun. All preparation with Lucy was also smooth and done with a smile. The Pembroke Lodge team ooze experience but make every wedding feel special and really listen to your wishes for the day. Highly recommend! Thank you to the whole Pembroke Lodge team, especially Robert, Lucy, the kitchen team and the staff on the day!"

V77,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue than Pembroke Lodge for our summer wedding. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most gorgeous backdrop for our special day. A huge thank you to our banqueting manager, Nelson, who went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly.

The team was incredibly supportive and accommodating throughout the planning process, making it an enjoyable and stress-free experience.

V77,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We got married on the 3rd of October this year, and the team made our day magical! What a smooth day. We loved every second of it! The guests loved everything, and raved about the food and organisation.
Hiring Pembroke Lodge was easy. We had a viewing where all information was shared in detail and super clear to understand and make a decision.
On the months leading up to the big day our contact was Alice. Alice is a star. Responsive, professional, and had answers and solutions to everything.
On the day, Nelson coordinated the whole thing, minute by minute, and we are forever grateful for his politeness, professionalism and high spirits. We felt safe and in good hands. I would give Pembroke Lodge way over 5 stars if I could :)"
V77,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","My wedding went without a hitch, thanks to the amazing team at Pembroke Lodge (special thanks to Nicola & Robert)! They made sure everything was set up perfectly on the day, exactly in the way we had requested, and then ensured the day itself went as smoothly as we could've hoped. Everything looked beautiful and the stunning views made all of our guests fall in love with the venue too."
V77,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had the most perfect day. The team have all been so responsive and accommodating of our every request. The venue is beautiful and we were lucky to have gorgeous sunset views. It is truly a countryside wedding but conveniently close to London, which was important for our overseas guests. The food was fantastic and staff were professional and efficient. Would recommend to anyone."
V77,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We recently had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge, and I cannot say enough good things about the venue, the team and manager, Robert. From the moment we started planning to the big day itself, he was absolutely incredible.

Robert went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. He was always available to answer our questions, offer solutions, and provide creative suggestions that enhanced our vision. He coordinated effortlessly with our vendors, making sure everyone was on the same page, which took so much stress off our shoulders.

On the day of the wedding, he was a true rockstar! He made sure the timeline flowed perfectly, from setting up the ceremony space to ensuring the reception transitions were seamless. His dedication and hands-on approach allowed us to enjoy every moment without worrying about a single thing.

Our wedding was a dream come true, and we owe so much of that to him and the team! Thank you, for everything you all did to make our day magical."

The food was delicious and all the team was so welcoming and super helpful on the day.

Thank you so much, we really really appreciate all the help!"
V78,The Hackney,"If you are having a wedding for under 60 people then this is your place! From start to finish the communication and planning of the wedding was seamless and took so much of the stress out of the day. The totally customisable packages that they offer really does suit anyone’s budget and more importantly regardless of what package you end up going for it is value for money. The food was delicious and it catered to everyone’s tastes including a pregnant guest, halal, vegan and lactose intolerant and was the talking point for our guests. The venue itself is stunning! Lots of exposed brick, they had recently redecorated before our wedding and the reception room that doubled up as the dance floor was styled simply but made a statement and the outdoor covered patio area was a welcome addition. The team understood our vision from the get go and they completely nailed it, all of our guests couldn’t believe it was here! I honestly can’t recommend it enough if you’re wanting a small and intimate wedding venue but still with all the class. I would say to future couples even if you think this wouldn’t be your venue please please do have a proper look because it will change your mind, I had come across this venue multiple times over the course of a year and decided to take a leap of faith and give it a chance and we’re so happy we did."
V78,The Hackney,"We can’t recommend the Hackney highly enough. They made the whole process so easy and they offer so much in-house which we took advantage of. The food was especially great - our guests were amazed “best food I’ve ever had at a wedding” and the team took great care of us during the planning stages.

They offer a very customisable service with scalable pricing. If you’re having a fairly small wedding (under 60) then you must check out The Hackney.

We had such a perfect day and we owe so much of that to the fabulous venue. Beautiful space, so professionally run."
V78,The Hackney,"We had such a brilliant experience working with the team at The Hackney. We were regularly in touch throughout the planning process and the use of the shared spreadsheet was especially handy for keeping everyone informed.
We had to postpone our wedding two days before as we were both sick with COVID, and the team were just fantastic. They waited for us to recover and then we started to talk through options again. We were able to rebook just six months after our original date, and the team were accomodating and understanding throughout the process.
The day itself was perfect. Lots of our guests commented on the quality and quantity of the food and Hugo was great at keeping everything to time. We wish we could do it all again."
V78,The Hackney,"We had our wedding reception here and wow was it amazing. Hugo, Erika and the whole team were amazing. Every single guest commented on how delicious and plentiful the food was. The staff were amazing nothing was too much to ask and all so happy.
The venue itself was decorated amazingly, given we left our wedding stationary etc up to the venue it exceeded our expectations. I was concerned about the allowed decibel level for Dj / entertainment but it was plenty loud enough. I wish I could relive the day again, if you’re thinking about booking The Hackney do it! You will not regret!"
V78,The Hackney,"We held our wedding reception at The Hackney in July and it was truly the best experience. We opted for a standing reception for our 65 guests, serving food bowl-style for a more relaxed, less formal feel. The food was absolutely delicious and there was lots of it - it just kept coming! Our guests are still raving about how good the food was months later! Lots of good drinks options too - we especially like the cocktails here!

The staff on the night were so friendly, welcoming and were amazing with our children guests too!

The Hackney is such an aesthetic venue with exposed brick walls and existing foliage which we loved, so we kept additional decorations to a minimum. We dropped our decorations to The Hackney the day before and picked them up the day after, which was super easy! We hadn’t given them too much direction with where we wanted everything placed but when we turned up to the venue on the day it was truly perfect! The staff know exactly what they’re doing and had decorated it beautifully! The outdoor seating area is a great feature too (especially for our two greyhounds who chilled out there for the majority of the reception!)

We opted for a simple Spotify playlist for our music and their sound system was good.

The wedding planning process was super easy from start to finish, with continued support and check-ins from Hugo, from the moment we booked, to the day itself! We really enjoyed the menu tasting experience earlier in the year too, which is a great touch in the build up to the big day! The planning spreadsheet was easy to use and made us feel content and relaxed, knowing that everything was under control.

Overall, we would highly recommend The Hackney to anyone looking for an affordable, dog-friendly, wedding reception venue with a laidback vibe, delicious food and lovely friendly staff! We look forward to coming back every year to celebrate our anniversary, with an espresso martini!"
V78,The Hackney,"We hosted our wedding reception with the team at the hackney in May 2023. The planning experience was straight forward and easy to book. The availability for the venue is on the website so easy to see when they have and get it booked. We went with the 5 canapés, bowl food menu, and drinks on arrival with wine through the event. The staff were brilliant and food delicious.

We loved the vibe of the venue as we wanted a bit more of a casual event, with a relaxed feel and we were able to host our 85 guests with no issues (although limited to standing event at this size, there is enough scattered seating for anyone to sit when they wanted).

In terms of decorating, we didn't feel the need to add any extra flowers as the venue was already so made up with plants and other decorations.

We did add the photo box which I highly recommend, was great fun for our friends and family and came with a memory book. People were shy at first but really got into it. We also used the recommended baker who provided a delicious cake.

Final area to mention - pricing. Wedding venues can be really expensive and daunting before you even start paying for any food or drink. Something that really attracted us to this venue was the low spacing cost and the minimum spend with it. It meant that we were able to completely customise the experience and see where the money we were spending was going. There are many different options and packages to go with, so it's up to you.

Only thing that wasn't offered was any tasting of the food beforehand which we would've liked to have done but none the less, the food was delicious so it wasn't really needed!

To finish, we loved every moment of it and hope that many others get to experience the same. Thank you very much team at the hackney!"
V78,The Hackney,"We had our reception in July. The venue was cosy and comfortably fit 30 people without feeling too crowded or too empty (we were worried it might be too empty). We managed to fit a band in, arranged mini-golf in the venue after dinner, and customize the cocktail menu with custom recipe (that we provided before hand).

One of the biggest highlights was the food. The crispy roast pork got so many complements and indeed it was tasty. But really, all the dishes were amazing (we had a tasting session prior), it was hard to choose, but the taste of each dish was still top notch on the day itself too. I heard that the supper snacks we ordered were great too but alas, I was too busy and they were snapped up instantly!

Some other details:
* We were allowed to use the small room downstairs as a private space to put our stuff. Very handy to not mess up items.
* We went with a bar tab and kept increasing the budget each time till the end of the night instead of the all-you-can-drink. From our rough calculations, it worked out about the same going for all-you-can-drink. Of course, certain folk were heavy weights and more than made it up will be different for each crowd.
* Lighting for photos came out excellent (combination of photographer and venue lighting).
* You can adjust air conditioning to suit the weather (we had ours on the warm side due to older folk not dealing with cold too well).
* Outdoor space was a pleasant change in atmosphere for those who wanted some fresh air.

What about the review from the Bride? Bride approved this review."
V78,The Hackney,"The day was fabulous - Hugo was brilliant and flexible with what we were after. The tasting day before was such a great idea and the whole experience and guidance given made planning a wedding in c.5 months so much easier. We had vegans, last minute drop outs, ridiculously hot weather, about 3 different spotify playlists, a string quartet, florists arriving in the morning and a cake that arrived the day before - the team took it all in their stride and it seemed like a breeze. Loved it all and we've had such good feedback from guests. A fabulous whirlwind.

Two very minor points for feedback - we maxed out the guest numbers (the team did advise us against it but were very accommodating despite us also throwing musicians into the mix) and it was a little too crowded pre-lunch on such a hot day. We also put some speeches in between courses (again, we were recommended against it) and that may have been a slight mistake for the dessert timings, as the tasting day was 10/10. But, it was a perfect day in a stunning venue. Loved it - thank you guys."
V78,The Hackney,"Jon and the team were absolute superstars, hosting the perfect wedding day for us. The space is beautiful, the decor is modern and perfect. They were so accommodating for any request or question we had which we really appreciated. Guests commented on how great the cocktails were! The day ran so smoothly and we had a fantastic time."
V78,The Hackney,"From the initial phonecall to the warm welcome we got when we first visited The Hackney, we knew we were in safe hands and that we’d made the perfect choice. The venue offers the most beautiful interiors - the perfect mix of cosy, intimate and modern industrial - exactly what we were looking for!

Our entire experience with The Hackney was an absolute dream -we loved the mega organised approach to planning. Something that could have been incredibly intimidating was made so straightforward with the amazing support of Hugo the General Manager who embraced all our weird and wonderful suggestions and gave expert advice on what we could do to make things even better. We left every meeting buzzing with ideas and even more excited to welcome our closest friends and family to the big day.

The quality of the food and drinks is impeccable - every single one of our guests (even the fussiest!) has commented on how much they loved it. We absolutely loved the menu tasting, even though it made the decision even harder as everything was amazing. What makes it even better for us is living close by and being able to pop into our wedding venue for a coffee or a cocktail!

I couldn't recommend The Hackney enough - I just wish we could go back and do it all again!"
V79,PYRÁ,"We held our wedding reception at Pyra. We booked the entire venue, with the upstairs loft serving as a dance floor with bar and downstairs having tables and seating for guests.  Canapes were served upstairs and a buffet dinner was served downstairs.  We lucked out with great April weather, so guests were also able to enjoy Pyra’s patio and additional space on Lonsdale Road. We were very happy with our decision to have our reception at Pyra, and many of our guests commented on how lovely the space was, how nice the staff were, and how delicious the food was.
 
The venue:
The space is gorgeous with lots of natural light upstairs.  Guests arrived at 4pm but we had the venue for the entire day, and Pyra gave our florist access earlier to set up beautiful flower arrangements and candles - it looked stunning.  Pyra set up our welcome sign and card box too. The venue also accepted delivery of our cake on the morning of the wedding which was a huge help, set it up very nicely upstairs, and cut it for us after the formal “cake cutting” shots.  We were able to coordinate with Pyra ahead of time to arrange the space how we wanted, such as how many tables we wanted downstairs and the set-up of the loft upstairs.  They even had a microphone ready for us upstairs so we could say a few words to our guests before our cake cutting. Perfect! For the evening dancing, we were able to set the disco lighting to our colour scheme, which worked really well with candles and foliage (latter 2 provided by our florist).
 
The food:
The buffet dinner was fantastic.  Pyra gave us multiple menu items to choose from and we were able to fix a nice menu that took into account guests’ dietary restrictions.  We initially booked the venue when it had a different chef and menu.  We came in a few months before our wedding to try the new menu – our dinner was delicious then and there was no dip in quality for the buffet-style served at our reception. Fionn worked with us how to plan best - because we wanted a relaxed style with a dance floor upstairs, we ended up feeding our 80 guests in two sittings downstairs, which worked perfectly. The upstairs space can seat 60 people, which didn’t work for how we planned our event, but does look really nice in photos. The late night food served around 10pm also went down very well.
 
The staff:
The staff, including the bartenders and waiters, were hardworking, friendly and very nice to guests.  Enough staff were around that guests never had to wait long for drinks.  Members of staff cut our cake for us and also boxed up the late night food for guests to bring home.  Fionn, the day-of coordinator, was on-site for our entire reception and was very helpful, even helping coordinate our midnight bus arrival.
 
Responsiveness:
Overall we were happy with the responsiveness of the venue.  It took a little while to nail down the final details of the food menu and drinks menu/bar tab but we were ultimately very happy with the result.  As the venue hosts more weddings/ larger-scale events we’d expect this will improve.

Overall:
We highly recommend Pyra for a wedding reception. We had 80 guests in total, which worked very well for the canapes/cocktail hour upstairs (4-6pm), sit-down buffet downstairs (6-8pm, split into two seatings) and dancing upstairs (8pm-midnight).  The upstairs loft was able to fit all 80 guests plus a four-piece band.  Lonsdale Road is also a charming street that provided great photo opportunities.  We looked into several other venues, and came away happy with Pyra's quote – we were able to book the venue, food (including canapes, dinner and late night food) and a generous bar tab for roughly the amount some other London venues were charging for just their space (no food or drink included). We and our guests had a fantastic time. Thanks so much to Fionn and the Pyra team :)"
V79,PYRÁ,"We had our wedding celebration at Lula. We booked the loft and restaurant for this.

Positives:
The venue is beautiful and needs minimal decoration.
The food was amazing; the chef is truly professional and everyone loved it.
They redecorated the restaurant section and added a set of couches to make it a lounge, which was beautiful.
The staff was very hardworking, professional, and lovely.

They provided us with a lounge, a wedding breakfast space and a dance floor.

Flexibility with Cake:
The bakery was scheduled to deliver and set up the cake at 16:45, but they delivered it at 09:45 instead. The Lula team handled the situation professionally by storing the cake and setting it up at the correct time. They presented the cake beautifully and assisted in cutting it into nice pieces. It could not have been more perfect.


The list of available drinks was huge, and they were happy to make custom drinks and bring in different juices if requested in advance. The event manager tried to accommodate every wish we had, and on the day we could not have hoped for more. Most of our guests said it was one of the best weddings and most beautiful venues they had ever been to.

Negatives:
Food tasting for the wedding menu was not included, which we had assumed would be, but it was given at a 50% discount. We had to sort out the floral decoration last minute, as they had initially suggested they would arrange it for us after providing a budget, but later said we needed to find our own. At times, they were a bit slow to respond, which made us anxious, but after communicating with them, this was resolved, and communication was very swift.

In conclusion:
Lula gave us the most beautiful wedding we could have dreamt of. We highly recommend them. The venue, the food, the service were amazing, and we could not have hoped for more."
V80,Sandon Manor,"We had such a special wedding at Sandon Manor, the team made every effort to make our day so so special and we will be forever grateful for that. A dream team! The day ran so smoothly and they worked so hard. The venue is unique with lots of different spaces which unfold throughout the day, which was perfect as our wedding fell on a wet and windy autumnal day. We would highly recommend Sandon Manor!"
V80,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor provided the perfect venue for our wedding. From the initial conversations and meetings with the team, we knew we were in safe hands and had made the right choice. They kept us informed with any events, made information a bit payments clear and reassured us with any query we had.
The accommodation was exceptional and fitted our requirements perfectly, with high quality finishing touches throughout to ensure our stay was as comfortable as possible.
The wedding venue was incredible! Our ceremony took place in the gorgeously modern barn with stunning draping and greenery. Following on, we had a blissful drinks reception which was on the expertly manicured lawn (with mini golf!) and sun-trap of a courtyard. We then moved onto our wedding breakfast which was held in the main barn, seating all of our guests comfortably with space for decor and extra details. Following from dinner, the part started and the club room came to life! This was absolutely the talking point of the day and our guests raved about how incredible it was! It managed to create a club-like atmosphere, whilst maintaining the vibe, albeit at a reduced volume, in the rest of the barn. The layout of the venue was important to us, as it ensured our guests never strayed too far, to keep the momentum of the day.
The team at Sandon worked superbly with all of vendors which ensured the day ran smoothly from set up to clearing. All of our vendors commented on how much they too loved working there.
The venue, the aesthetics, the staff, everything was perfect! We would absolutely recommend to anyone getting married."
V80,Sandon Manor,"We cannot recommend Sandon Manor enough. From the quality of the service, the helpfulness and friendliness of the team, the beautiful accommodation and the most amazing venue which all or guests loved partying the night away in. To make it even more special the Manor is in amazing grounds in beautiful countryside and nature reserves.
Sandon Manor made our dream come true."
V80,Sandon Manor,"I couldn't recommend Sandon Manor highly enough - from our first enquiry to our Wedding, nothing was too much trouble. The team are so friendly and easy to communicate with, very approachable and responsive. They respond to any questions immediately and having the day before to set up with Tom was fantastic. Styaying in the Manor House and Dovecote was the icing on the cake as to be with friends and family the night before and the day after was so fabulous. On the day Tom and the team were absolutely fantastic and couldn't have done more to make our special day. We couldn't have dreamt of anywhere more perfect than Sandon Manor - a huge thank you to all the staff."
V80,Sandon Manor,"If you are considering Sandon Manor for your wedding venue, I beg you: scratch it off your list now. Yes, the house and grounds are beautiful, but the people behind it are absolutely awful. They ruined our wedding experience.

I will get straight to it. Sandon Manor has a very strict policy on guests leaving the site by 11:30pm (and no one is allowed back to the Manor unless they’re official guests staying overnight). We had lots of international guests at our wedding. Many hadn’t seen each other in years and would be jetlagged - we thought they may be keen to continue chatting after 11:30pm. With this in mind, we made a booking with Sandon Village Hall via our contacts at the church (where we were attending services and later married). They granted us access to the village hall until 1am as a contingency spill over space.

We mentioned this in passing during our online meeting with one of the Sandon Manor team a month before our wedding. Within hours, I received a voicemail from the lady in charge of Village Hall bookings saying (quote) “someone at Sandon Manor is trying to throw a spanner into the works for you”. It soon transpired that they had raised an official complaint to the parish council and pressurised the village hall team into cancelling our booking. To be clear, Sandon village Hall and Sandon Manor are entirely separate entities – there is no crossover between them whatsoever, as the owner of Sandon Manor later acknowledged.

It gets worse. Gob smacked, we asked Kate – the owner of Sandon Manor – for a call to find out what was going on. She was abhorrent, trying to justify her meddling as a necessary measure to protect her wedding license (side note: with Sandon Manor it is always about the money – once your deposit is paid they care nothing for your ‘special day’; you are just another cash cow). Did she apologise for stabbing us, her clients, in the back? No, she did not. She could not even fathom how hurt we were by being completely bypassed in the communication chain and how deceitful and disrespectful this was. My husband and I were quite literally left speechless. We’ve never experienced this sort of treatment from anyone, let alone our wedding venue - to whom we were paying many thousands of pounds. Dealing with this stress in the final month of wedding prep really took its toll on us and soured things. We no longer looked forward to our day, rather dreaded what Sandon Manor might do next.

Aside from this major incident, there were many other occasions when Sandon Manor were unhelpful and unfeeling in their interactions with us:

- We enquired if it would be possible to arrange a large pizza takeaway order instead of using Sandon Manor’s caterer for our late night food. One of the team explained on a call that this wasn’t contractually possible; we acknowledged this. We then received an email saying ‘If you are unable to follow this or any other of our T&C's we would be happy to cancel your booking.’ This was less than a month before our wedding.
- We had a harpist perform in the church. We were told she wasn’t allowed to play during our drinks reception in the grounds due to potential noise complaints (an acoustic harp at 2pm in the afternoon). No other music was permitted outside the house.
- Sandon Manor is an incredibly expensive (in hindsight, grossly overpriced) venue. But we were also hit with hidden fees when booking their accommodation option - an extra £425 ‘cleaning fee’ was added to our bill.
- At the time of booking, Sandon was running a promotion waivering the £700 fee for hiring their ceremony space. As we were marrying at the church, we asked if it would please be possible to put this towards other elements of our day i.e. using their festoon string of lights in the barn (for which they charge £450). They refused.
- We were unsure about booking the 1-bed Dovecote on the grounds as - at £499 for the weekend - it was a considerable expense. While we were deciding Sandon Manor rented it out on Air BnB (to one of our guests, which made for a very awkward conversation).

To summarise, you only get one wedding day. Kate and her team absolutely ruined ours. There are so many other lovely venues in north Hertfordshire run by decent, humane people. Please prioritise your happiness and choose wisely. I wish we had."
V80,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor is a stunning wedding venue with a great team behind it. The exclusive use of the manor for the weekend was a highlight, allowing us to relax with friends and family in the lead up to and after the big day. The Sandon team were brilliant, guiding us through the planning process and ensuring everything ran smoothly on the day. We couldn't have asked for a better place and team to help us celebrate our big day."
V80,Sandon Manor,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our special day. Holly, Tom and the rest of the brilliant team made us feel welcome from day one. Special mention to Tom for making the day run so seamlessly, so professional and accommodating of all our needs.

The venue itself is stunning, located in the beautiful Hertfordshire countryside. The Manor House makes for a tremendous location to prepare, and the Dovecote suite is a nice touch: a great addition for the groom to spend the last night. We loved the small details of the characteristic main venue, with the botanical feel to the bar a great backdrop to the barn.

It’s a shame we can’t stay every week!

Dan & Suzanne"
V80,Sandon Manor,"To Holly, Louise, Tom & Kate, wow, what can we say but the biggest thank you for the best day of our lives! When we viewed the beautiful venue over two years ago we just knew instantly Sandon Manor was the one, not just because it’s stunning, but you guys are amazing! Thank you for making all our wedding dreams come true. Forever grateful and can’t wait to return to reminisce. Lots of love, the new Mr & Mrs Jakes xxx"
V80,Sandon Manor,"From the moment we visited Sandon Manor we knew this would be our wedding venue for 9 September 2023. Seeing the spectacular finish of the house carry through to the completed venue just shows the high level of attention to detail this venue had to offer.

Holly, Tom and the rest of the team filled us with confidence right from our first interactions, annd went above and beyond on the wedding weekend itself to facilitate us, our suppliers and guests. The main house, dovecote, annex and extensive grounds were a wonderful way to have close family stay with us on site, and so handy to be able to all get ready nearby the morning of.

Thank you for making our wedding weekend a truly memorable occasion, for us and our families. We all look back on this day with the happiest, sunniest memories and Sandon Manor will always have a very special place in our hearts."
V80,Sandon Manor,"We had the most amazing wedding weekend at Sandon Manor.

The venue itself is the perfect backdrop for a wedding, our photos looked amazing from every single angle. There were so many spaces to make use of throughout the day which helped things to run incredibly smoothly and meant we didn’t need to have a ‘turnaround’ during the evening. The spaces really wowed our guests and created such a lovely atmosphere. Including the ‘club room’ dance floor that had our guests dancing until the very last song!

We stayed at the Manor House for the weekend, extending our wedding into a perfect weekend retreat. The house itself is beautiful, with lots of different areas for everyone to relax, and the perfect peaceful location to chill the night before the big day!

From our first viewing to checking out the day after our wedding, the Sandon staff were attentive, friendly and helped us feel relaxed and looked after throughout an otherwise overwhelming process. We’d highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for a beautiful, peaceful and unique wedding venue!"
V81,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Thank you so much to the entire team for making our wedding so special! Thanks to Donique, MJ, Mo, Harry and everyone else for helping us organise our day and for their professional but friendly attitude. Merchant Taylors is such a beautiful venue and offers a brilliant layout and different spaces to make the day so special!"
V81,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you all so very much for such an amazing wedding on Saturday. You all worked tirelessly to make it so special. Everything was truly wonderful and you all did me proud! Both Hugh and I couldn’t have asked for anything more in terms of being so well looked after. Our guests were so impressed and have given us so many compliments on a brilliantly well run event. Thank you all again for playing a brilliant part in our truly wonderful day of which we loved every minute
V81,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you so much for the most wonderful wedding reception at the end of April. We had the perfect day and our guests all commented on how well looked after they has been. Thank you again for all your hard work!
V81,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"We know this is very late (we have no excuse), but we wanted to say thank you for everything you and the team at Merchant Taylor's did for us on our wedding day. All the guests have since told us how much they loved the venue, food and service. Fingers crossed you get a few couples getting in touch! Again, Thank You for everything!"
V81,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"My brother and I attended the wedding today, as Florist's for the wedding party.
We were treated fantastically well by ALL the staff that we met, nothing was too much trouble and they made our task a COMPLETE pleasure.
If this is how they treat the actual wedding party then you will have a unforgettable time. Many thanks to all the staff for helping us to do our job with ease ."
V81,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Zara,

Can we thank you and your team at Merchant Taylor’s Hall for all your hard work in making Caroline and Neil’s recent wedding so very special. You, in particular, were able to deal with every question and request in a really professional manner.

Merchant Taylors’ Hall is part of the rich panoply of history and tradition, which makes this great City. All of our guests, and in particular those from abroad, were totally spell bound by the atmosphere, the food and service.

James was superb in organising the whole operation. To turn the Great Hall from a wedding ceremony hall to a banqueting suite for 110 guests, including flowers, place settings and dance floor in ninety minutes was truly remarkable.

The food and wine was of an amazing standard, we know that Merchant Taylors’ Hall has a reputation for presenting some of the finest dining in the City of London. You certainly surpassed all expectations.

We have many wonderful memories of the 10th September 2016, but it is best summed up by our daughter Caroline, “Can we do it all over again?”."
V82,Garden Museum,I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate everything that you did to make our party such a success last Friday. It was brilliant being outside on such a lovely everning. Everyone was very impressed with the venue.
V82,Garden Museum,"Thank you for all your help, advice and on-the-day support, it really made our wedding very special and it certianly went off without a hitch! The Museum looked amazing and the garden was perfect, especially as the sunshine adn the guests wanted to make the most of the beautiful surroundings."
V83,Clearwell Castle,"Can’t tell you how wonderful the team were at Clearwell. Our wedding coordinator Phaedra was exceptional. Attention to detail and everyone of the team from front of house, waiting staff, groundsmen and the DJ made our day absolutely everything we dreamed of and unique to us.

Can’t recommend highly enough and cost was outstanding value for money.

So many our guest commented on the quality of the food and that it was the best wedding they had been too! The children loved the magic of the castle and opportunity to get outside and see the grounds.

The grooms family had a fabulous time staying in the cottages the night before and our guests at both the Castle & the Wyndham had a fabulous stay on the night of the wedding.

Wish we could do it all again!"
V83,Clearwell Castle,We had our wedding at Clearwell in June and we couldn’t recommend it highly enough. From start to finish everything was perfect and they went above and beyond to ensure we had an amazing day. I’d not hesitate in recommending them to any couples. Just a gorgeous place with staff that really care in making your day all that you hope it will be.
V83,Clearwell Castle,"From the moment we first visited Clearwell, we knew this was the venue for us. From the moment we started planning to the final touches on the day, all the staff were fantastic. Ann, our wedding coordinator, was a delight to work with throughout. Nothing was too much trouble and she kept us updated throughout. The day was tailored exactly to our needs and when we arrived at the venue on the day they had prepared everything perfectly.

We did the night before package which included rooms and food the evening before. We were supplied with so much food no one went hungry. The rooms in the Wyndham and the Castle are fantastically appointed.

The venue itself is gorgeous. The cellar bar downstairs adds a whole different dimension to the occasion where you can really let your hair down.

This was an absolute dream come true venue for us. We loved every single minute."
V83,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot fault this venue at all. We initially had to change our wedding date because of lockdown and they were so supportive and empathetic.
Ann, our coordinator, is quite possibly the loveliest person on the planet. She was always happy to answer any questions and it never felt like we were being a nuisances or asking a silly question.
On the morning of the wedding she was a lovely calm presence and the whole day just ran like clockwork.
The food was out of this world with many guests saying it was the best food they’d had at a wedding and one person actually thought we’d hired a Michellin Chef!
The venue is so so beautiful with plenty of space. The downstairs cellar was a great place to party the night away, it was like an exclusive nightclub. There were lots of quieter rooms for people who wanted some peace.
The DJ was brilliant, we forgot to give a list of songs we liked but he did a great job of guessing what we liked ( he must’ve looked at our age and figured nineties dance music was our era. And he was bang on the money)
I do not have a single complaint about this venue"
V83,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot speak highly enough about Clearwell Castle as a wedding venue. The venue itself is absolutely stunning. It rained on our wedding day but the indoor space was so vast and beautiful that ourselves and our guests still had the most amazing time! Our wedding co-ordinator, Phaedra, was absolutely incredible, both before and during the wedding. She was always so professional, replied to all of my emails (there were many) and answered all queries efficiently. On the day, we genuinely could not have managed without her. The day flowed so well with her guidance and it really helped me as the Bride as I felt I didn't need to worry about anything! All the other staff at Clearwell and at the Wyndham hotel were also so wonderful! Everyone worked so hard and every member of staff was so kind to us; it just made our day incredibly special and we are so appreciative to them all. The food was great, service very quick and all the guests really enjoyed it! We had so many compliments about the staff and venue! I honestly could not recommend Clearwell castle more as a wedding venue!"
V83,Clearwell Castle,"Our wedding on 10/11/23 was just the absolute perfect day from start to finish. Our wedding planner manager, Hannah, was incredible, not just on the day but throughout the whole planning process. She ensured everything ran smoothly on the day, sparing no details ensuring everything was just perfect and to time but without being stressful. She was very accommodating with the planning meetings working around both mine and my now Husband's shift patterns.
We both stayed the night before our wedding and the night of the wedding with many of our guests travelling a distance so also staying in the Wyndham which was very convenient. Staying in Keepers cottage with the Bridesmaids the night before added to the experience with the added feature of the hot tub, the groomsmen were very jealous. The beds were very comfortable and everyone was excited to stay in a castle.
On the day of the wedding, the staff were very accommodating moving the bridal party along to the bridal suite to finish preparations earlier than originally planned. The breakfast provided was the perfect amount for a busy morning getting ready. Everything, including the gardens, were immaculately kept adding to the WOW factor of getting married in a Castle.
The canapes served and welcome drinks were well received by the guests and ourselves whilst we had photographers prior to the wedding breakfast. The food was phenomenal and great portions and I was stuffed after. The staff were very accommodating for us with a lot of people with allergies, dislikes of mushrooms so adapting the menu for these individual people. We were even able to swap out a few bottles of wine included in our package for cocktails as us as the Bride and Groom did not drink wine.
As soon as we walked in the venue the first time, we knew it was the place we wanted to get married. Everytime we went back to view the venue again I fell more and more in love. For anyone thinking about viewing or even booking this incredible venue I would say do it! We will be going back for events in the future to relive the best day of our lives."
V83,Clearwell Castle,"We got married at Clearwell castle April 2023. What can I say it's the most perfect venue and we had the most amazing day. The organisation was amazing and the staff were great on the day and even leading up to the big day. Phaedra was our wedding planner and communication with her was great throughout and on our wedding day she ensured that it all ran smoothly. I cannot recommend Clearwell castle and their staff enough. Thank you again for helping us have our dream wedding.
Kind regards

V83,Clearwell Castle,"We had the most amazing wedding day on the 24th of November 2023, the whole day ran so smoothly and all our guests absolutely loved the venue. The food was amazing and our guests loved the fish and chip buffet in the evening! The whole progress of planning the wedding was so straight forward and Phedera was a great wedding manager."
V83,Clearwell Castle,"Clearwell Castle exceeded all our expectations for our wedding day. The moment we stepped onto the grounds, we were captivated by its timeless charm. The staff, especially Hannah, went above and beyond to make every detail perfect, ensuring a seamless and stress-free experience. The Ball Room, where we exchanged our vows, felt like something out of a storybook. The surrounding gardens provided a stunning backdrop for photos and added to the overall enchantment of the day. Our guests were equally impressed, and many commented on the unique and romantic atmosphere. Choosing Clearwell Castle was the best decision we made for our special day; it truly felt like a fairy-tale come to life."
V83,Clearwell Castle,"We had the perfect wedding at Clearwell Castle, their team were superb in providing planning assistance from the point of our booking, guidance on all aspects of our wedding choices from registrars and suppliers, and coordination on the day of the wedding to make sure it flowed seamlessly. It was a beautiful day, and we couldn't be happier with our choice of Wedding location."
V84,Inner Temple,We got married here in 2023. Everything was perfect and the team made sure the day/food etc was just as we wanted it. Particular thanks to Priya and Eva (Pegasus) for their hard work making our wedding day and lead up so special.
V85,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"I got married at Dodford Manor in February this year. A great time was had by all and I will be recommending the venue to any friends planning weddings.

The weather was bad on the day so we didn’t get to use the outside area very much, but it didn’t matter as the inside is so lovely.

Sky was really helpful and put me at ease on the day. Questions in the lead up and on the day were answered quickly and I was made to feel like the only bride in the world!"
V85,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford was the first venue we looked at shortly after we got engaged. The staff were friendly and relaxed when we had a tour, I knew it was the place for us! I think Lydia telling my now husband that we couldn’t have fireworks due to the animals nearby but we could have a fire performer outside, sold the deal for us! I got an amazing fire performer as a surprise for my husband and the guests after we had sparklers, and it just completed an amazing day!
We heard such positive things Dodford about how professional and smooth running weddings have been from our suppliers, and you guys didn’t disappoint. You handled the day so well, we didn’t worry about a thing and just enjoyed ourselves the whole day.
We honestly had so many lovely messages and conversations after our wedding about how the venue was amazing, everything and everyone was catered for, from my 88 year old Nan, to young children who could play and enjoy the outdoors with a scoop of amazing ice cream. We honestly couldn’t have asked for a better day, we would do it again in a heartbeat if we could! Thank you for making the day so seamless! We are eternally grateful to everyone at Dodford for making our dreams come true becoming Mr and Mrs Price!"
V85,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford Manor what an incredible venue, from initial enquiry to booking, Dodford and the staff were so accommodating and well organised. Nothing was ever too much trouble, even if emails were being sent at 11pm. The day itself, wow it was absolutely incredible, as our wedding was on a budget and due to small numbers Dodford were amazing at setting out our decorations, everything was absolutely perfect and a special shout out to Kayleigh who was amazing on our wedding day. She kept us on time, always checking we were okay and just such a lovely person and really made our day perfect. Would highly recommend a Dodford to any couple due to be married they make the planning and the day an absolute dream and we want to relive it over again."
V85,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"It goes without saying that Dodford is a fab venue.... stunning set up, well maintained, clean, perfect grounds etc... but the best thing about Dodford is the team! I had super high expectations of any wedding venue I booked as I used to run a wedding venue myself (potential nightmare client 😂).... from the 1st viewing the team were fantastic. Relaxed, stress free, organised, professional, knowledgeable, flexible but mostly importantly friendly which gave me complete confidence in them delivering my perfect day.
In the run up to the big day the team are super responsive on email and phone We didn't meet our Event Manager, Lydia, until the day but I was always confident that they work as a whole team and therefore having 1 point of contact was not necessary at all.
In the day Lydia was amazing! Still relaxed and professional and the whole day ran so smoothly. Every requirement was perfect, on time, delivered exceptionally.
We had the best day, thank you to the whole team (especially Lydia!)

V85,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We honestly can’t say thank you enough for how amazing Dodford Manor Barn was, along with all the incredible staff who helped make our day truly unforgettable.

From the moment we visited, we fell in love with the beautiful landscapes, open-plan barns, and stunning large windows that flooded the space with natural light. The venue package was one of the best we saw during our search—it felt like everything we could possibly need was covered.

The team at Dodford Manor Barn were incredibly friendly and supportive throughout the entire planning process. Communication was open and consistent, which made everything feel so much more manageable and stress-free. We were even able to find all of our wonderful vendors through Dodford Manor Barn, which was a huge bonus!

As a bride who suffers from anxiety, I was unwell on the morning of the wedding. But I have to give special thanks to Kayleigh and our vendors, who were absolutely amazing and supported me through every step—they helped me feel calm, cared for, and ready to enjoy the day.

Our guests couldn’t stop talking about how stunning the venue was and how lovely the food turned out. We were also lucky enough to have sunshine all day, topped off with a beautiful sunset in the evening—it truly felt magical.

Thank you again, Dodford Manor Barn, for being such a perfect place to start our next chapter.

With love,
Carter & Emmie (24.03.2025) x"
V85,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"From the moment we booked our wedding at Dodford Manor, we knew we were in good hands—but nothing could have prepared us for just how extraordinary the experience would be. Every single detail was handled with such precision, care, and genuine warmth that it truly felt like a dream come to life.

The venue itself is breathtaking, but what made our day unforgettable was the impeccable service. The entire team operated like a well-oiled machine, making sure everything ran smoothly while keeping the atmosphere joyful and stress-free. Their attention to detail was second to none—no request was too big or too small.

We want to give a heartfelt, special shoutout to *Lydia*, our incredible Wedding Manager. From our first meeting to the final dance, she was nothing short of amazing. Lydia went above and beyond at every turn—anticipating needs before we even voiced them, coordinating flawlessly with suppliers, and offering support with a calming confidence that put us completely at ease, (apart from making me cry the second I saw her! 😂). Her passion for what she does shone through in every interaction, and our day would not have been the same without her.

Thanks to this amazing venue and its phenomenal team (especially Lydia!), we were able to truly enjoy every moment of our wedding, knowing everything was in the best possible hands. If you're considering this venue for your big day—don’t hesitate. It’s everything you hope for, and more.

We want to do it over and over!
A day we will NEVER forget!!

Thank you again and all our Love,
Mr & Mr Pargeter-Prince
Rowan & Karl xx"
V85,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We booked Dodford Manor in Feb 2024 after we viewed the space, for our wedding in March 2025. It was the only venue we viewed, but instantly fell in love with the character and variety of spaces the venue had to offer. The free corkage also really appealed to us as a great way for us to bring our own drinks at a good cost.

From start to end, the team were amazing, helping us with the planning of the day and making sure we had a great array of suppliers we could work with. The live band was a huge part of our day, and Dodford have a great mixture of acts on their supplier list.

On the day of the wedding, the groomsmen arrived at the venue to help with set up to see that our amazing event manager, Kayleigh had every single aspect of the day in hand and sorted. She sorted all table settings, decor, stationary - Everything!! Nothing was too much to ask of her and the Dodford team. The day ran impeccably well, with everything being on time and everything we asked for being sorted. Our drinks were served chilled, on time and were always around. It’s easy for venues who offer free corkage to try and limit you drinking your own drink - Not here!! There was constantly beers being topped up, wine bottles replaced and aperol spritz being taken round. Cannot fault them!

The team packed all of our bits away and ready for us to collect the next morning. We are very aware Dodford is a busy venue and wanted to make sure we wasn’t just “another wedding” but at no point was that the case. We felt like we were the one and only wedding and genuinely could not ask for more!

Thank you so so much for everything, Highly recommended!!"
V85,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We got married her a month ago today and had the most amazing day with them. Jess, Jack and the team made sure that everything ran smoothly and that they were doing everything they could for us on the day. We would 100% recommend them for anyone wishing to marry in such a beautiful setting."
V85,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We had been apprehensive booking Dodford for our reception that it was so popular in Northamptonshire that our wedding could end up looking the same as a lot of others we knew of, as we're local - but that was a ridiculous thing to worry about! The level of flexibility/customisation you get with Dodford is unmatched in our opinion; as it's such a beautiful venue to start with, you don't have to work hard to make it look good before adding in your personality as a couple!

The whole process from enquiries to final planning and the execution on the day were great. We did have a slight issue with them not inviting us to a food tasting in enough time before our wedding date (whether they forgot/we were missed off a list we don't know) but when we did raise it they invited us to a tasting at their sister venue instead (it's 2 hours away but we were available to travel thankfully). Every member of staff we encountered in our experience with Dodford were so friendly and make you feel like you are the only couple that matters for them in that moment, which we really appreciated from such a popular/busy venue. Abbie was our Event Manager on the day and provided such an elevated level of service, nothing was too much trouble and she executed our plans/vision to a tee, adding in some extra details that we loved too.

Our wedding was in December 2024, and we only had our reception at Dodford, so the ceremony barn was set up for our drinks reception with plenty of space for guests without it feeling cramped or equally like we were all rattling around in there (we had 75 guests for our reception). They don't have many photos of indoor drinks receptions in their promo so I was a little worried how it would look but the team had it set up beautifully. We also had a brass band on the mezzanine level which was really fun and festive!

What sold Dodford for us was the no daytime corkage, which meant we could really personalise our drinks reception and wedding breakfast drinks without breaking the bank. There was a slight disconnect with how and when we had requested/planned to serve some of the drinks in our planning meeting and what happened on the day, which we think may have been a slight hiccup in communication between Dodford and Jenkinsons (the caterers), but it didn't have a negative impact on our day at all!

Overall, there's a reason this is such a popular venue - it is truly perfect!"
V85,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,Dodford manor is an amazing wedding venue. From the very beginning when we first stepped into the venue to look around we fell in love. We knew we had to have our wedding there. After booking the venue we had amazing contact with the staff from booking our food tasting session. To a general email to see how our wedding planning was going. The planning meeting was well organised and we were able to talk through exactly what we wanted and no want was too big for the team.
V86,Gosfield Hall,"I never imagined my wedding would be somewhere as stunning as Gosfield hall but from the minute we saw this venue we knew it was the one for us and didn't bother viewing anymore venues as we had already made our minds up about having our wedding here! We were absolutely blown away with the natural beauty of Gosfield hall and so booked two years in advance of our wedding day! The professionalism and advice we received from Linda was super helpful and informative on the run up to our wedding as there is soo much to think about! We loved that we could have our day and evening all in one place aswell as the option weather permitting to have our wedding ceremony outside. I'm pleased to say the weather was absolutely perfect on our wedding day and we got to have our fairytale wedding outside! The package we paid for was well worth the money! Our guests were absolutely spoilt on our day and have all said it was the best wedding they've ever been too! It was amazing to have our guests stay over aswell! Jocie our wedding planner was absolutely amazing! She was sooo friendly and super accommodating and went above and beyond on our day to make it absolutely perfect with no hiccups! She even helped dress me on the day as she knew how to do up a corset dress and my mother didn't have a clue lol she made all my wedding details and decorations come to life and done such a stunning job decorating our dream venue aswell as being super supportive towards me my family and guests! The honeymoon suite is the best we've ever seen and completely took ours and our guests breaths away! Mind blowing! The food,venue,grounds,accomodation and night before accomodation were absolutely stunning and we want to thank everyone at Gosfield hall for making our day soo incredible and special and a day we and our guests will never forget! We can't wait to return to Gosfield! Thank you everyone at Gosfield what an amazing place!"
V86,Gosfield Hall,"We had previously experienced Gosfield Hall as a guest before deciding on it for our anniversary.

Our day was beautiful and went according to plan. Our guests all had great feedback about the day.

The only thing we would have changed would have been more diverse menu for the main meals."
V86,Gosfield Hall,"Gosfield hall is a beautiful location for a wedding and their packages cover all the important stuff! We didn’t have to worry about caterers, wedding coordinator or a DJ - all included! Great service, lovely food and everyone really enjoyed the day! Our coordinator Jocie was fab on the day, getting everything organised and fetching anything we needed. Couldn’t have asked for better, she knew the time line and the day flowed really smoothly!"
V86,Gosfield Hall,"We got married at Gosfield Hall and everything about it was perfect from when we arrive to view it, booking, the communication and Faye Carter our wedding Coordinator! If you want the best wedding day with no hassle, Gosfield is your place!!"
V86,Gosfield Hall,"Myself and my Wife have just got married at Gosfield Hall,
Our expensive started when we viewed the venue and we first met Linda sales manager, she welcome us in & made us feel at home, we wasn’t sure how, but she made us feel calm like this was where we was meant to be.
Once we looked around at all the venue has to offer we had already made a decision as this is such a stunning location and instantly new this was what we wanted! It was just right for us.

We did not get made to feel pressured to make any decisions immediately however we did end up booking our big say within the next few days after our visit.

Our next contact was with Ellie our wedding planner, she was very helpful and nothing was ever to much, we enjoyed the food tasting at the venue and was very impressed with the experience, it was out of this world.
Ellie helped us through all of our problems and made sure all of our plans come to life.

Now on our big day, what can I say? The staff were amazing, Ellie couldn’t have done enough every time you wanted to ask a question she was next to us any time we needed something. She was there all the way through the day/ night & even the next morning, Ellie made our day Run seamlessly.
We’ve been to many weddings before but never have we had food as amazing as we did here.
Every guest was amazed at the food quality and commented on how delicious it was!
Just to sum up if you’re thinking about booking your wedding at Gosfield Hall don’t question it just book it. You will be amazed."
V86,Gosfield Hall,"The venue is stunning and was the perfect setting for our winter wedding (so much natural light even in January). Jocie Golbourn was our assigned wedding planning specialist and she is so kind, sweet, patient and professional. All our guests loved the venue but many actually commented on how flawless and seamless the day was organised and rooms decorated and prepared from each section of the wedding and we only have Jocie and venue staff to thank for their meticulous planning and preparations. The food and drinks were delicious. Couldn’t recommend this venue enough- we actually booked the venue on a whim and were SO happy when we visited for an open day. There’s no false advertisements- it’s stunning."
V86,Gosfield Hall,"Everything, from start to finish, was exactly what we wanted and more. The preparation was helped by our wonderful personal manager, Tara, and accommodated each and every one of our requests and needs. The venue is gorgeous, food delicious, and atmosphere felt special. Our friends and family all told us that this was such a spectacular wedding for them that it was the best they've ever been to. We felt completely taken care of, kept us calm and happy throughout the day, and kept all of our suppliers in place and to standard. It felt glamourous and unique. We wish we could relive the day over and over. It really was our dream wedding."
V86,Gosfield Hall,"We got married in Gosfield Hall in May and had the most amazing wedding day that any couple could ask for. The whole experience from the arrival the night before to leaving the day after was seamlessly managed by the team at the venue.
The house and the grounds looked absolutely stunning and Ellie and the team did a brilliant job at keeping the day running smoothly without making anyone feel rushed. Everyone there was immensely friendly and helpful and we really felt that everyone who worked there was invested in making our day feel special.
We fell in love with the venue when we booked it but the whole experience exceeded out expectations so much that we wish we could do it all again!"
V86,Gosfield Hall,"I wanted to take a moment to commend and state our appreciation for Jocie. She truly was phenomenal, approachable and no task was too big.
We had 5 months to plan our wedding and we loved every moment. With us both working in the service industry it was great to have someone who was so switched on and would be an asset to have on any team."
V86,Gosfield Hall,"Having just got married at Gosfield Hall I can honestly say it was the most beautiful venue and the most perfect day. The staff were so attentive and professional. The food was outstanding and the drinks and cocktails were fabulous. They couldn’t do enough to make sure our day was everything we’d dreamt of. I have to say a special thanks to Ellie - one of the wedding coordinators on site - she went above and beyond to help us plan our day and was there from the very moment I woke up delivering fresh pastries for breakfast to the moment she made me a cup of tea to go to bed with. I can’t thank you enough Ellie, you are an absolute credit to Gosfield Hall."
V87,Kingston Estate Totnes,"When I first enquired with Kingston I thought it would be too expensive but we explained what are budget was and when we wanted to get married and they put a quote together that was affordable.
We have just had the most amazing one day wedding which didn't finish until the early hours. We got married in the Long Barn where there are chandeliers running down the middle, it was very romantic. There is this nightclub at Kingston which is very cool which everyone loved. The guests all said the venue was stunning and the food was out of this world.
A few of us stayed the night before and most of our guests stayed the night of the wedding in the cottages and barns. The staff were brilliant and they coordinated the whole day for us. I cant recommend the venue enough."
V87,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had a two day wedding at the Kingston Estate. All our guests were completely blown away by it.
Most of our friends and family had traveled far for the weekend and were not disappointed when then arrived as the cottages and barns are gorgeous. Some even have hot tubs.
Jodie and the Weddings Team organised a welcome party for the first night which was unreal along with providing street style food for everyone around 8.30 pm. At Kingston they have this really cool enormous Yurt and food hut which is used the day before the wedding and for breakfast.
On the wedding day itself we got married in the Walled Garden and there were endless canapes during the drinks reception. We then decided to eat in the Hayloft Barn which has glass windows overlooking all the gardens.
We used the clear span marquee for our reception party and had the craziest cover band before we all went into the nightclub until 3 am. The good thing about Kingston is everything is included they let you use things like cake stands, easels, knifes, speakers, microphones, all furniture at no extra cost, they set everything up for you and then clean up afterwards. We didn]t have to do anything which made everything totally stress free.

Thank you Jodie, Ellie and Charlotte it was insane !!"
V87,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had the most magical wedding at Kingston. From the moment we set foot onto the grounds, we knew it was the perfect place for our special day. It was our first viewing… and nothing else compared for us (we saw a total of 6 venues). What stood out to us the most was the variety of spaces available for each part of the day. The selection of ceremony areas, the beautiful outdoor spots for photos, the yurt for the night before party, and a special one for us… the underground nightclub for the evening! As party lovers, this was a part that sold it for us; there was somewhere for every moment.

One of the things we loved most was the flexibility to personalize every aspect of our wedding. The venue truly felt like a blank canvas that we could transform into our dream setting, but equally, we got away with doing absolutely nothing as it was beautiful all on its own.

But what truly made our experience unforgettable was the incredible staff, led by Jodie. They were not only professional and attentive but also genuinely warm and welcoming. Their support and attention to detail ensured that everything ran smoothly, allowing us to relax and fully enjoy our day.

We're hoping to return and stay in the future, for a special occasion.

It's not just a wedding venue; it's a place that holds a special spot in our hearts as the backdrop to the beginning of our happily ever after 🤍"
V87,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Kingston was perfect. Despite a rainy start, the day was amazing and Jodie was available but subtly in the background allowing the day to be ours."
V87,Kingston Estate Totnes,"After over a two and a half year wait due to Covid, our son and his wife had a wonderful wedding weekend. Jodie from Kingston Estate and her team of staff went above and beyond to ensure the wedding ran smoothly. Every detail was dealt with professionally. The accommodation, venue and food were all excellent and all our guests many from overseas had a wonderful time. The only thing Jodie could not oversee was the weather but even a little rain didn't spoil the celebrations."
V87,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue and staff were brilliant from start to finish. The venue is really multi-functional and caters for rain or shine. The weather was really unpredictable around the time of our wedding but I was a stress free bride knowing they had it in hand. The food supplier was stunning - we had a weekend package which all the guests raved about. That coupled with the unlimited drinks pages made it the perfect venue for us. A Devon treasure that feels like being on a film set - everyone loved it!
V87,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Such a beautiful venue - we loved it so much. The food was incredible and despite having a changeover of wedding planner close to the wedding day, it had no impact on our day what so ever. The venue are calm and professional and loved their approach to communication which was friendly."
V87,Kingston Estate Totnes,Fell in love with the venue on our first visit. We were particularly looking for a venue which could cater us for 3 days and sleep the majority of the the guests. The grounds were well kept especially the walled garden which is where the ceremony took place. The team were a pleasure and made the day truly special.
V87,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Our 3-day wedding celebrations were spent at the STUNNING Kingston Estate - a truly unique venue that we absolutely fell in love with. It had EVERYTHING we were looking for & more. The grounds are perfectly manicured all year round & come complete with walled garden. The cottages & main house are beautifully decorated, providing luxurious accommodation for 86 of our guests. Sarah & the team were such a pleasure to work with & couldn’t do enough for us. The catering was also top notch. Thank you"
V87,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue was great we had a few personal health issues beforehand but the team went above and beyond to make the day extra special. The wedding planner organised everything for us and they had plenty of props on site that we were free to use. We had the whole place to ourselves for the weekend it was brilliant and our friends loved the hot tub and pool.
V88,Holmewood Hall,"We were married at Holmewood Hall on 15th February 2025 and I can honestly say that it was the most magical day. We went to visit the venue and instantly fell in love with it but even we were blown away by how beautiful everything looked on the day. All of the staff were amazing - special shoutout to our personal wedding manager, Laura Pike, who was always on hand to answer any questions - she couldn’t do enough for us! The food was wonderful & we had full control over the menu. Would highly recommend this venue, you won’t regret it!"
V88,Holmewood Hall,"Holmewood Hall was an absolutely perfect wedding venue. The house is stunning, well cared for and beautifully decorated. All of the staff are so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Our Wedding Coordinator was fantastic, available from early morning of the wedding and was still there the morning after working for us. The food was excellent, drinks and canapes were amazing and the venue took care of everything for us. We had the most perfect wedding and are so pleased we chose Holmewood Hall. The Gold Room where we had our ceremony is gorgeous. Thank you for giving us a beautiful wedding!"
V88,Holmewood Hall,"I cannot fault this venue at all, the venue itself is breathtakingly beautiful with magnificent rooms and very lovingly maintained grounds. The staff are incredibly friendly, professional and efficient, our wedding coordinator Lee was a pleasure to work with and made our special day run smoothly. If you want a hassle free wedding with breathtaking grounds and the most amazing staff then this is the venue for you."
V88,Holmewood Hall,"Had the most amazing wedding here recently and cannot recommend it enough.

The venue itself is stunning and the options included in the luxe package covered everything we could've possibly wanted and made planning the wedding 100x less stressful.

The staff were all amazing from start to finish, Katie showed us around initially and then Lee was our personal wedding manager, and they were both incredible throughout. Always on hand to answer any questions and help us through the day once we got there.
We had so many comments from our guests on how lovely the staff were on the day!

A particular highlight though was the food - the tasting evening was a dream and the chef went above and beyond to provide a full vegan menu for us which wasn't limited to only a couple of options.
Again, we had so many non-vegan guests complimenting the food and saying how lovely it was!

Overall, an incredible day and an incredible venue.
Thank you so much to everyone there!"
V88,Holmewood Hall,"This place is simply just amazing 🤩
We had our wedding here on 17-12-24 and it was everything we dreamed of and more. The food, staff, decor were just perfect not forgetting the most beautiful Christmas tree 😍
Our person wedding planner Lee was an absolute god send not just having him there on the day but always being at the end of a phone to answer any questions or worry’s.
If we could go back and do it all again we would and not change a single thing.
The most perfect day at the most perfect venue ♥️"
V88,Holmewood Hall,Perfect venue for a wedding with guest numbers 60 - 100. Our guests and I moved from each room to a new room throughout the day and every room had a new surprise. The bridal suite was lush and it was great having all our guests staying under one roof. I would 100% recommend this to anyone.
V88,Holmewood Hall,"The wedding day and lead up to the day were fab. However, for the price we paid, we expected a little bit more.
I opted to use the bridal cottage the evening before for which we paid £450 extra. This is something I now regret, as there was no hot water and we were not able to order any food in as all the take away options were shut (on a Friday night). The hot tub also needed a good clean. So the night before/morning of my wedding was not ideal. I flagged this to the manager who advised that we should have raised the cold water issue as soon as possible, but seeing as we were trying to have morning showers on the wedding day, this did not leave us any time.
Our package included pre-drinks, wine with dinner and we also purchased a cocktail ""cart"" (cocktails on a table) and a bucket of beers. The groom, who is not a wine fan, asked for a beer with his wedding meal and was presented with a contactless card machine to pay for it at the top table. We felt this was a bit unnecessary as there was a full bucket of extra beers outside and it felt a little embarrassing having a card machine presented to us at the top table on our wedding day for one measly Corona, despite the huge amount we had paid. Also, guests were unknowingly allowed to buy beers from the bar after the meal, despite there being available beers to them already in a bucket next to the bar...
Overall the wedding was lovely, but for the price we paid we expected a bit better. Essentially, I loved the venue, but I wish we had not purchased any extras!"
V88,Holmewood Hall,"We got married at Holmewood Hall on 4th October 2024. From the first moment we stepped into the venue and I saw the magnificent Gold room I knew this would be the perfect place for us to get married. We had the most amazing day which was perfectly coordinated by the whole team at Holmewood but especially so by our personal wedding manager Lee. Lee was always quick to respond to any questions we had in the lead up to the day and nothing was too much trouble for him.
We honestly wish we could do it all over again as it was a magical day. We would recommend Holmewood Hall to anyone looking for the perfect venue."
V88,Holmewood Hall,"After getting engaged in late March this year we wanted to get married fairly quickly so booked Holmewood for the same September. The venue, grounds, accomodation were all stunning and we felt very fortunate it was within budget and the package we got was outstanding in comparison to other venues and what it included, which was far far more than other venues. We got to attend a luxe event to choose all our wedding food, canapés, cocktails and wines which should have made things easier but due to the unbelievable quality it made it harder! Our wedding planner Lee is literally the most fantastic person. He was flexible, fun, engaged and on absolutely everything. The day was ran impeccably and also smooth even with some weather concerns and speeches taking a bit longe than we thought. If you book here ask for Lee!! We had the most perfect day. Can’t fault a single things. Our guests all told us how incredible everything was with one even saying he will now longer not attend any further weddings unless it’s at Holmewood. Thank you to all the staff and as mentioned a huge special thank you to Lee! Your a legend!"
V88,Holmewood Hall,"Exceptional venue, stunning grounds, fantastic DJ, and excellent service. Highly recommended! Happiest day of my life 😊"
V89,Bourton Hall,"We got married at Bourton Hall on 08 March 2025 and our wedding planner was Harminder. The day was absolutely amazing from start to finish. All the food and drinks were of a high standard and presented beautifully which includes the wedding breakfast, canapés and cocktails, and breakfast the next day. The venue is gorgeous with lots of rooms, well maintained grounds and exclusive use. The staff are friendly and accommodating and the event was really well managed. We would like to particularly thank Harminder, who was supportive throughout the wedding planning process and the wedding day, ensuring things ran smoothly and in a timely manner. He is a great communicator, provided advice and guidance where needed and attention to detail. We really had a magical day! Thank you so much! We would happily do it all over again and would definitely recommend this venue!"
V89,Bourton Hall,"What a fabulous wedding venue! Because it's a wedding venue and not a hotel that holds the occasional wedding, they really focused on what was important and anticipated our every need. It's an elegant venue but with a comfortable feel to it. The team are incredibly accommodating and helpful and each couple is allocated their own personal wedding manager to guide them through the process and to make sure every detail is covered.
There's a beautiful chapel on site where non-religious ceremonies can be held - this was fabulous.
The food was plentiful and delicious - all our guests raved about it. Great choice of welcome drinks and canapes, wines and cocktails.
The grounds are gorgeous; a perfect backdrop for our October wedding.
The venue was exclusively ours and has beautiful bedrooms, including a huge, stunning bridal suite. Most of our guests stayed overnight and took advantage of the brilliant breakfast in the morning so it really extended the celebration."
V89,Bourton Hall,"Our wedding at Bourton Hall was better than we ever imagined. The Italianate mansion is truly spectacular inside and out however it is the team that made our day run perfectly. Our guests found the setting and the food incredible, they were very impressed! Our wedding planner Emily Sarjant was fantastic her knowledge and expertise made our day magical from start to finish, with all the special touches that she suggested. Our first dance was created in such a beautiful way it will be a memory we cherish forever. Thank you to Emily and the team at Bourton Hall. My husband would also like to note that the croquembouche was amazing and everyone should have one."
V89,Bourton Hall,"My wife and I got married at Bourton Hall in September, with our wedding managed by the wonderful Eleni. Everything about the day went as perfectly as we could've wished, right from arrival to departure the following day. The venue is stunning, and the food was lovely, and having 21 bedrooms on site was such a bonus so that all of our close friends and family could stay on site with us.
Bourton Hall did everything they could both in the run up to the day and on the day itself to alleviate all stress to ensure everything ran as seamlessly as possible, which it absolutely did.
We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall enough."
V89,Bourton Hall,"We were married on 28th July 2024. What an amazing day we had at Bourton Hall. Could not fault it! The venue is so elegant! The grounds and views were to die for. The food was out of this world with so many choices and all cooked and served to perfection. Accommodation / rooms were plentiful and luxurious. Lovely to have a chapel on site too. We had the whole place to ourselves, we felt like royalty! Lots of varied rooms and areas for people to choose where they wanted to be after the wedding breakfast. We would choose the venue all over again!"
V89,Bourton Hall,"We had both our wedding ceremony and reception at Bourton Hall and the service was superb throughout. The house and grounds are beautiful with amazing views to go with them. The staff were professional and helpful during the lead up to our wedding day and during the day as well - even when we had an emergency prior to the ceremony which caused delays, the venue staff were able to work around this to move timings back in order to allow all of our planned activities to go ahead and be fully enjoyed. All the food was delicious and we had a wonderful wedding day thanks to Bourton Hall."
V89,Bourton Hall,"We had the most perfect wedding day at Bourton Hall. Throughout the planning process and on the day, the team were so professional, which meant we could relax and know that everything was in their capable hands - Emily was an amazing wedding manager. The building is beautiful inside and out, and the grounds are stunning - there are so many places for beautiful photos, and views out over the countryside. The food was absolutely delicious, it was so hard to choose what to have! It was also so helpful to have so many places for guests to sit and chat in the evening, away from the disco room but still part of the action. Having so many bedrooms onsite (not to mention a stunning bridal suite!) was an added bonus. We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall highly enough, and have had so many comments from guests saying what a beautiful, elegant but relaxed day it was, so I know they really appreciated everything Bourton has to offer too. Thank you so much to Emily and the whole team for giving us such a perfect day!"
V89,Bourton Hall,"As the Bride and Groom we were made to feel like nothing was too much to ask and they couldn't do enough to make us feel special.
All the guests commented that it was one of the prettiest and most relaxed weddings they have been to.
We could not have asked for a better wedding day thanks to Bourton!"
V89,Bourton Hall,"I had my wedding on 10/02/2024 I am so happy I chose this venue, It is really magical. My wedding manager was just the best! Emily went above and beyond to help me on my big day! I cannot thank her enough.

One of the main things about this venue is that t has its own chappel which is really special and makes you wedding seem more traditional, however there are more options/ rooms available. I wanted the wow factor and I got it.

Some of the options that made it great

*Onsite accommodation for night before and night of the wedding is really helpful
*Exclusive use
*Dedicated wedding manager definate gamechanger! (Emily)
*Menu choices are fantastic.

Everyone commented on the food being really nice ( we had the lamb) The evening buffet was also great. I paid extra to have a meal created as having part of my culture within the food at the wedding was very important to me, they did not disappoint.
Emily was perfect in so many ways, she knew exactly my vision once i explained it to her and she made sure that it became real for me. She adapted parts of the day so that it would work better, for example bringing the canapes outside whilst photos where being taken. Helping me into my dress, looking after my phone just everything I needed she was there. She really worked hard to make sure it run perfectly and it did.

Thank you emily!!! You made my day Great."
V89,Bourton Hall,We got married at Bourton Hall on 30th July 2023. It was the most amazing day ever! We are still receiving compliments from our guests on how stunning the venue was and the whole running of the day. This was 100% down to our wedding co-ordinator Harminder. He went above and beyond to ensure our day was absolutely perfect. He literally could not have done any more! Thank you again Harminder!!
V90,B&H Buildings,Bourne & Hollingsworth was such an exceptional venue for our wedding this September. This is the perfect place for you if you want a true London wedding that feels like a fun dinner/house party but on an epic scale. We used the top floor (the studios) for our sit down dinner (think candle light and tasty roast lamb) and headed downstairs for our reception with the basement club (below and hidden) for late night dancing. The place is stunning (greenery and glass everywhere and the cocktails are insane but what really makes this place are the people. The whole staff from Matt and Lizzie to the bar team to the dinner crew made our whole day seamless and so fun. Could not recommend B&H more highly for your London wedding.
V90,B&H Buildings,"Beautiful wedding celebration in the most stylish venue - we had an intimate wedding reception (drinks, dinner and more drinks!) at the Bourne & Hollingsworth Buildings. The staff members on duty were excellent - nothing was too much trouble and they served everyone with such professionalism. We couldn’t recommend it highly enough and we haven’t stopped talking about it since. All of our guests were so impressed with the space and how stylish it was. The bar, restaurant and greenhouse are all aesthetically beautiful and the botanical vibes make for a very relaxed, but premium setting. Special shout out to Lizzie who helped us coordinate everything and Matt on the day who led the team. Thank you so much - we had the best day and we couldn’t have wished to host it in a better venue."
V90,B&H Buildings,"India & the B&H team were seamless. Flexible, responsive, kind, and easy to deal with. They made our day so special. The food was fantastic, the drinks were lovely, and the value for money was first rate!"
V91,Leez Priory,"I never in my life thought I would get married in a place like Leez priory! The whole experience from start to finish was just fantastic. The price breakdown was manageable and there was no pressure to take any upgrades offered. The things we got in our package were phenomenal and having a wedding planner was tremendous - our lady (Leanne) was an absolute god send!
They catered to all our needs and we were made to feel so comfortable and nothing was a problem! I’d highly suggest going to an event there before hand, just to get a feel of what it’s like full of people and enjoy their delicious food. We actually enjoyed their entertainer ( singer) so much we hired him for our wedding ☺️
Lee priory is just so beautiful. I can’t speak highly enough x"
V91,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory on the 7th of September 2024. Considering how long they have been a wedding venue, they were pretty flexible with some of the ideas we had for the venue styling that turned out amazingly!

The staff really made the day something special and couldn't have done enough for us. Special mention must be made for Leanne, our wedding planner, who was amazing!

Highly recommend the venue and the incredible team that helped to make our day so special!"
V91,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in October 2024. This venue is stunning both inside and out with immaculately kept grounds and interior. The hospitality in the lead up to and on the day of the wedding was fantastic. The food was also brilliant. Another great perk of this venue is the amount of on site accommodation.

A couple of drawbacks / experiences during our wedding. There are only a few toilets in the main building which kept blocking and overflowing throughout the evening which led to us taking some guests to the dressing room or honeymoon cottage to use the facilities. You are also restricted by the venue on any external food or drink suppliers and the venues optional extras for this are quite expensive for what they are.

That asaide, we had the best day and evening at Leez Priory and would certainly recommend it!"
V91,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in August 2024- great venue and experience from initial viewing to leaving the morning after the wedding. Leanne acted as our wedding planner and was friendly, professional and helpful throughout. We opted for the classic package and the food was amazing quality with everyone commenting how full they were!
The venue is beautiful with several options for ceremony both inside and out. Accommodation was great too. The whole day ran smoothly with perfect weather - we will have very happy memories of our day!"
V91,Leez Priory,"Perfect venue and very attentive staff, lovely food and great communication from start to finish"
V91,Leez Priory,"Stunning venue. Fantastic Team. Very accommodating toward our unique ""surprise"" strategy. Our guests were truly surprised. Thank you."
V91,Leez Priory,"Leez priory was the 1st and only venue we looked around when we started planning our wedding. From the moment we stepped on the premises, everything just looked so perfect and exactly what we wanted from a wedding venue. When we got assigned our wedding co-ordinator Rachel, she was just absolutely spot on with everything we asked for and nothing was too big an ask for her. She made sure the day ran as smoothly as possible and took care of any issue that arose without me knowing (which I am forever grateful for!!)
The rest of the staff were amazing and very helpful.

The venue itself is just absolutely stunning and we loved that it has the pub area as well as the dance floor so it catered to all of our guests.

All of the rooms were lovely and it was so nice being able to stay in the fisherman’s lodge onsite the night before the wedding.

We genuinely cannot recommend this venue enough and it was 100% worth the money! 10/10!"
V91,Leez Priory,"We got married on a Tuesday in October to maximise the value of what we could get for our money; and honestly, we got everything we wanted and more. Leanne, our Wedding Manager was perfect at bringing an attention to detail and seamless organisation to the big day, and in the lead up. There wasn't one moment of the day where we felt stressed, as Leanne had it covered. In one particular instance, our flowers for the bridal party's hair hadn't arrived. Within five minutes of telling Leanne that we needed this, the flowers were with our hair and make-up suppliers to add the finishing touches.

Leez Priory as a venue is the most stunning setting, and offers an incredible range of areas in which the ceremony and reception can take place. There is also the opportunity for the bridal party to make use of the Fisherman's Cottage the night before the wedding, and for people to stay in the on-site accommodation on the evening of the wedding, making it the perfect venue for people also travelling from further afield.

Leez Priory were very accommodating, welcoming and were happy to work with us to make our day as perfect as possible. The food was incredible, and a total hit with all of our guests, and so many people have commented on how incredible the day was as a whole. You wouldn't be disappointed to choose Leez Priory."
V91,Leez Priory,They catered to our every need. To when we would ask for things they hadn’t been done before they still made sure it went smoothly. Leanne was amazing she made me feel so comfortable from the start. The whole day was stunning. Beautiful venue please go view it as you will not be disappointed
V91,Leez Priory,We got married on the 26 May 2024. This venue was absolutely brilliant! They catered for every need and made sure there was no stress on the day. Leanne was kind and level headed throughout and was always one step ahead! Do not hesitate to book- do it now!
V92,London Rowing Club,"We picked this place because we wanted somewhere fairly central and casual. We fell in love with the long room and the view. Our wedding was in October so we thought we'd have it cosy but we ended up with a beautiful autumnal day so everyone was on the balcony. The fairy lights were perfect and the other rooms were great to avoid leaving. The staff was so friendly and accommodating that we would definitely recommend the venue.

The only thing that could have tainted the day is that after three visits and many emails, we were never told that the river floods (a lot). We were flexible with our day so if we knew this we would have built it into our day, instead, I was told by the photographer on the day as I got out of the taxi that we wouldn't be able to take any group photos because the area would be flooded during the cocktail hour and half that we had assigned as photo time. This would have been disappointing but we all ended up running outside after the ceremony to take photos before the tide came in. My husband and I borrowed wellies for our couple photos. We had fun doing this, but I can imagine many couples being upset! My friend's electric car also flooded and they were obviously upset."
V92,London Rowing Club,"Annabel was meticulous in her help planning the wedding. Very knowledgeable and helpful.
On the day the rest of the staff were brilliant - there wasn’t an empty glass in the house.
Great venue at a reasonable price on the London riverside."
V92,London Rowing Club,"LRC was the perfect place to celebrate our wedding this summer. The venue staff went above and beyond to ensure that everything went as planned both before and during the event. Thanks in particular to Annabel who was responsive, helpful and always put us at ease in the build up. The location is stunning - couldn’t have asked for a better day!"
V92,London Rowing Club,"We just wanted to say an enormous thank you for everything. From the moment we came to visit the LRC on a slightly grey January weekend, we knew it would be a fabulous venue for our June wedding reception and it certainly did not disappoint. It really is the most beautiful setting and we have very fond memories of our guests enjoying drinks in the sunshine with the most fantastic view over the Thames. The venue has such character and lends itself beautifully to a wedding reception. We have received so many compliments from our guests and I would encourage anyone thinking about booking their wedding at the LRC to do it, you will not regret it! We were lucky to be blessed with beautiful weather so were able to have our jazz musicians play on the balcony for the drinks reception before moving into the Long Room for our meal. It looked stunning with the tables dressed and mantles adorned with flowers. Following the meal and speeches, guests enjoyed drinks back on the balcony and in the Fairburn and Members Rooms which provide plenty of seating, whilst the Long Room was cleared and the band set up. We then partied the night away.

From start to finish, the organisation was so straight forward. Annabel was very accommodating and full of helpful advice in the run up. I knew that on the day she would ensure things ran like clock work, which of course they did. Our suppliers also commented on how helpful the LRC team were to work with. On the day the staff were brilliant and went out of their way to ensure everything ran smoothly (including borrowing some large gym fans from the rowers to put in the Long Room to keep us cool as it was an unexpectedly hot day). We really can’t thank you enough and now need to think of an excuse to host another party with you in the future!"
V92,London Rowing Club,"We got married in St. Mary's church and then had our reception in the London Rowing Club in February 2023. It far exceeded our expectations and was an incredible fabulous stress-free day with thanks to the wonderful Annabel making the day just run.

In the lead up to the event, Annabel was incredibly responsive, helpful and helped us plan the day exactly how we wanted it. She answered all our questions really quickly, always got back to us, was very flexible with what we could do and allowing us to personalise the space. Prior to the event, Annabel arranged for us to go and have a look around on a couple of additional occasions to help us plan how we would want it to look. She also gave our caterers a tour of the kitchens as they were new to the venue.

In the immediate lead up to the day, Annabel helped with our suppliers in getting chairs delivered and bringing all the wine over a day earlier. On the day, she helped to make the day flow and just dealt with things throughout the day.

The venue itself is beautiful with three rooms to use. A middle reception room, a cosy snug and the main long room. In the main long room, there is a rowing boat hanging upside down with fairly lights. The main lighting can be dimmed and gave a wonderful atmosphere for the evening meal. As our wedding was a winter wedding, it was fairly chilly so they lit fires in the main room and snug which added to the atmosphere.

We had around 90 guests - could have fitted a few more just about. We used the round tables, tablecloths, linen, plates cutlery and glasses provided and they were perfect for a wedding and looked very smart. No need to hire these. As mentioned, we did hire separate wedding chairs instead of the conference chairs provided. There's a lot of decoration in the way of rowing memorabilia on the walls which means you don't have to actually do too much to make it interesting for guests.

Overall, the perfect London wedding venue with absolutely fabulous views across the Thames with a long balcony to enjoy from. To top it off Annabel is truly amazing and so helpful."
V92,London Rowing Club,"We had our wedding (ceremony+reception) at LRC in July, and the venue itself and the team we worked with were absolutely incredible! Everything on the day went without a hitch and we heard so many compliments on the location - our guests loved the balcony and the layout inside, which included plenty of space for anyone wanting a break from dancing to sit down and relax. Would recommend to anyone looking to host an event!"
V92,London Rowing Club,"London Rowing Club is a truly fantastic venue and we were both so delighted with how our day went! The venue has real character with the classic rowing memorabilia and it’s location on the Thames, and looks amazing when it’s all set up. The layout and size of rooms I thought were perfect for our wedding of about 70 (+15ish more in the evenings) and of course the big attraction is the balcony which all of our guests adored!! (I wish I’d had more time during the day to stand out there and enjoy it 😂). Not only is it a fantastic venue in a great location but what really made this the most amazing venue was how great all of the staff, and all the recommend suppliers were! The day exceeded expectations and we got compliments on the place and the staff from all our guests. Couldn’t be happier with the venue, it was perfect for us!!"
V92,London Rowing Club,"We found the London Rowing Club while desperately combing through London locations after our original venue fell through a few months before the day.
Luckily for us it was available due to a cancellation - kismet!
From the start the charming Annabel put us very much at ease and helped us to envisage the day as we hoped it would be. She was very flexible and helpful throughout the planning process.
We were incredibly lucky with the weather on the day and the venue really came into its own - it was virtually impossible to get guests off the terrace, which is the perfect size for our smallish event (65 people) and of course offers gorgeous river views.
We were well looked after by the team and everything went off without a hitch. The interior of the space itself is lovely with a great sense of history.
Nice additional touch - table tennis was made available in the entry room for the later part of the evening!

It's a special place and I'd thoroughly recommend for anyone seeking a memorable spot to tie the knot!"
V92,London Rowing Club,"We got married at the London Rowing Club on a brilliantly sunny winter day on Saturday. All the way through in the run up (after 2 years or more of postponements), Annabel and team bent over backwards to help us arrange everything, recommended some brilliant suppliers for food (Shona Pollock comes highly recommended) and flowers (same with Steph the charityflorist.)

So many of our guests said how lovely the venue and staff were on the day, and the whole place looked a million dollars with an amazing photo set on and around the balcony and river - although we haven't seen those yet. The corkage and bar tariff prices are also incredibly reasonable for an inner London location!

I can't recommend the LRC highly enough. It will live in memory for a very long time."
V92,London Rowing Club,"The London Rowing Club team alongside the Dinner Ladies went above and beyond to ensure that we had the wedding perfectly fitting our requirements. Throughout the entire all of the suppliers worked seamlessly together to ensure the space transformed as we progressively added guests and transitioned between eating, our ceremony, more eating, music and dancing. We wouldn’t have had it any other way. The attention to detail of the team is second to none - perfect for any bride and groom seeking a beautiful event."
V93,The Prince Albert,"The team at The Prince Albert were always accommodating, made everything easy and stress-free, and helped us organise an amazing wedding party. They really knew what they were doing, and helped guide us through the process calmly, working around our schedule (which wasn't easy - we live abroad!) to make sure all our last-minute worries and concerns were sorted smoothly. The food was excellent, and the space was fantastic for our party. Can't recommend it highly enough!"
V93,The Prince Albert,"We had such a happy wedding with Harrison and this venue. Harrison was really flexible and answered any questions we had and made great suggestions when we needed seating arrangements, the schedule for the day, a florist, and more. The day was accessible to everyone and the food and drink were perfect. Thank you for making out wedding stress free and wonderful."
V93,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert was the most wonderful venue for our London wedding. We came across the venue at there wedding fair and chose alot of our suppliers from the same wedding fair.

Harrison and Lauren were always so on hand to help with any questions and did a fantastic job answering all of our questions. The staff were so friendly and helpful and made everything run like clockwork.

We couldn’t recommend The Prince Albert enough for a london wedding and would love to do it all again."
V93,The Prince Albert,"My wife and I were beyond happy with how everything went on our wedding day. Harrison, Diana, Claudio and the whole team were absolutely phenomenal! It was such a beautifully efficient operation, and we always felt like someone was there to help us when needed.

We've had dozens of compliments about the great food and how wonderfully intimate the venue was for a wedding. Some of our more traditional relatives said they were initially sceptical at the prospect of a pub wedding, but that it was one of the most beautiful and joyful weddings they’d been to. A friend of mine was also very happy that someone at the bar remembered her drink order throughout the evening! On top of that, everything ran perfectly to schedule, which is no doubt down to the high attention to detail.

It was very useful that the upstairs was free on Friday afternoon so that we could set up the space. It gave us plenty of time to do the flower arrangements, put up the bunting, and stick photos on the frame wall.

Thank you again so much for all the help and support you've given us - it really was the best day of our lives (so far)!"
V93,The Prince Albert,"My husband and I got married here in late September 2023, and I cannot recommend the Prince Albert enough!! Booking a wedding venue can be stressful and we felt like a lot of the venues we looked at gave us the ""hard sell"" but the folks at the Prince Albert helped to put us at ease every step of the way. We fell in love with how beautiful the pub was, so hired the upstairs for the ceremony, wedding breakfast and party afterwards for around 40 - 45 people. We were able to drop off decorations the night before and talk it all through with the staff, and they did such a good job of working with us and the florist to get the place looking amazing. The ceremony went off without a hitch, everybody loved the food and we had a blast in the evening. All the staff were amazing, but special shout out to Harrison and Lauren for helping us plan and run the day, and Maria for managing everything on the ground both when we dropped off the decorations and during the wedding itself. Thank you again for helping us celebrate our special day with our loved ones, for making it so stress free and so memorable!"
V93,The Prince Albert,"All you ever hear about wedding venues is that everything is a rip off, the food is meh, and there are a ton of annoying restrictions...the opposite is true of Harrison and The Prince Albert team. From Day 1, Harrison made the whole process not only easy but really fun! He was quick to respond, super knowledgeable, and very accommodating; he even helped our best man execute a surprise for us without it disrupting any timings. On the day, they decorated the place beautifully, managed to serve a 3 course dinner to 76 people unbelievably fast, and everyone raved about the food - to say they did a good job is a gross understatement, they went above and beyond. We were after ""classy fun"" and that's exactly what we got - thank you so so much!"
V93,The Prince Albert,"We had the exact wedding reception we wanted at the Prince Albert thanks to Harrison, Claudio and the other amazing staff who helped us feel so relaxed in the build up and during. We wanted a very low-key vibe and the team understood that but there were enough options for any style of wedding you wanted. The upstairs function room felt cozy and intimate while still leaving breathing room and space to dance, but you could easily rent the whole place if you wanted more guests and even choose to do your ceremony there. We had the most compliments on our food (we chose a buffet option). The team were particularly accomodating to some complicated dietary requirements and it was all delicious."
V93,The Prince Albert,"July 6, 2023 was the most memorable day of our lives! A big thank you to Harrison and the rest of the team for assisting us through out the whole process. Our guests loved the Prince Albert pub especially the sumptuous food and booze on our wedding day!

David & Dannah"
V93,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert is a Great venue for the classic Pub Wedding.
Harrison and the team did an amazing job to organize everything. The food was great and the service first class. Only sorry it was over so quickly. Thanks again for everything."
V93,The Prince Albert,"We found The Prince Albert when our original venue cancelled on us less than 2 months before our wedding. & we are so glad we did; everything happens for a reason! From the moment we met Harrison, we knew we were in safe hands, and the team at the Prince Albert made our day amazing. The pub looked beautiful and we were very greatful for the effort the team put in putting up all our decorations. We had so many compliments about the food, and we were very impressed in the swift and organised manner in whichever it was served. Everyone had a wonderful time, and we would not hesitate in recommending The Prince Albert."
V94,Kindred,"We chose Kindred for our 60 person wedding and it could not have been better. We wanted a venue where we could have the ceremony, dinner and dancing all under one roof, that was wheelchair accessible, and easy to get to on the tube, Kindred ticks all those boxes and more!
The food is incredible, we really enjoyed popping by to do all the tastings, we'll continue to come to the Cellar for food and cocktails. Many guests commented on how good the food was.
The place itself is gorgeous, inside and out. We used the whole venue, the main Hall for the ceremony, dinner and dancing, and the Library upstairs for the drinks reception and cake cutting. Also, being right next to Hammersmith station, the venue could not be easier to get to!
The staff are wonderfully attentive and helpful, both before and on the day. They were really open to the little details that made our day uniquely ours, from the drinks selections, to having a table and glasses on stage for the ceremony, to playing our music selections at the right time. Plus its a dog friendly venue!"
V94,Kindred,"We LOVE this venue! We got married here with only 12 weeks notice and Anna, the owner, and her staff went above and beyond to make the day as memorable, magical, and marvellous as we'd hoped it would be. The venue is elegant, stylish and perfect for a London, city based wedding. The food is sensational as it comes from their in-house kitchen on the ground floor and every guest remarked on how delicious their meal was. It's restaurant quality food, not your standard wedding food. The place looks stunning in all our wedding photos and the wedding cake they made us (at very short notice I might add!) was second to none. Everyone loved it. The venue was also perfect for late night dancing and drinking and merriment. It was such a pleasure - and a breeze - to work with Anna and her team on one of the most important days of my life, and I very much hope to do so again in the future. I will forever be grateful to her and all she helped us with."
V94,Kindred,"We had our wedding reception for 35 guests at Kindred, in the Library and Salon earlier this year. The day went incredibly smoothly, the staff couldn't have been more attentive and our guests raved about the food for weeks afterwards. It was the perfect sized space for our intimate celebration, really cosy and the atmosphere was great. The little touches really helped to make the day special, with espresso martinis served for the speeches and sparklers for our exit at the end of the night. Thanks again to the lovely Kindred team!"
V94,Kindred,"I cannot find a single fault in our experience with Kindred for our wedding. Not only was it a stunning venue that honestly made some of our guests gasp as they arrived, but Anna and the team were so incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. Having them support us really took so much of the wedding planning stress away and we knew we were in safe hands. I really appreciated that the team were happy to chat through ideas with me and were always keen to find creative solutions to give us the day that we had envisioned.

The food was absolutely delicious and they were so accommodating for our long list of dietary requirements from our guest. The cocktails were also so delicious. Our guests were buzzing for weeks after, as were we.

On the night, the staff were not only incredibly helpful and efficient, but also just so friendly, welcoming and complimentary. We felt thoroughly spoilt and very well looked after.

We visited so many venues and this was by far the best choice for us. The interiors made for some stunning photos and the layout of the spacing meant that whilst we had 80-100 guests, it still felt very intimate. I cannot recommend Kindred enough!"
V94,Kindred,"We would give a thousand stars if we could. Kindred hosted us for our cocktail style wedding and it was everything we could have hoped for and the perfect venue for this style of wedding. The wine, cocktails and food (incredible grazing board, canapés, bowls and pizzas) were exceptional and the team were on top of everything, friendly and nothing was ever an issue. We would HIGHLY recommend it. We have had loads of guests message us to tell us what a spectacular venue it was with the most friendly team. The venue had different spaces to suit our needs and the AV is amazing - it worked perfectly for our live music band and our DJ, and our own music playlists for our ceremony. They took the stress off planning and really did mean we could relax and not worry that everything would run smoothly. Thank you so much Kindred team for giving us the best day of our lives"
V95,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The best day of our lives and me and my now husband couldn't be more thankful to Bredenbury. Before booking Bredenbury we visited over 17 wedding venues in Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Herefordshire - we fell in love instantly, there is no need for a crazy amount of extra expense on decorations, the venue speaks for itself. The fact that it was no corkage just added to why we wanted to book and the team were so friendly. In the lead up to the wedding they were brilliant, we booked far in advance and brought over all our family members to come see the venue, they were so flexible, understanding and welcoming - they couldn't do enough for us. On the wedding day they had decorated for us by the time we had arrived and all we had to do on the day was to enjoy it - which was perfect. It really was the best day of our lives, all the comments from our family and friends was how beautiful the venue was. They kept the day running so smooth and we didn't need to think about a thing."
V95,Bredenbury Court Barns,"There truly aren't words to describe how incredible Bredenbury Court Barns and their entire team of fantastic staff were through the planning process and the day itself. They were so friendly, supportive and nothing was ever too much. From quick replies to any questions that popped to mind to planning meetings that left us feeling prepared and ready to the day being set up beyond perfectly. Our amazing wedding coordinator Lianna spent the days and months (years really!) leading up to our big day making sure everyone detail was perfect, that everything was incorporated that we'd dreamed of and made sure we didn't feel a moment of stress from start to finish. All throughout the building from the bridal booth, to the orangery to the oak barn was beautifully light and open - even with our wedding being the end of October - and we had so many compliments about this! There aren't enough words to say thank you and explain just how much we'd recommend this venue to everyone"
V95,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We had the perfect day back in July. The weather didn't go to plan but they helped make the day so special even with the last minute switches because of the rain. We had such an amazing day and the feedback from our guests about the venue, food and service was great! We cannot thank the team enough for the effort they put in throughout the whole process but especially on the day. We felt incredibly supported throughout the whole process."
V95,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The venue itself is stunning. The buildings, grounds and interior decorations are all beautiful and immaculately presented. From the moment you turn down the lane it is so picturesque, you know you've found somewhere special. It's exactly what we were imagining for our wedding venue.

The layout is perfect, with ample space for guests to mingle and move about, and great accessibility for older and disabled guests. Ours was a winter wedding, and while most of the day was inside it wasn't cramped and we could still enjoy the beautiful grounds through the expansive windows that run along the whole barn.

All of the venue is stunning, but practicality-wise the Bridal Suite warrants a special mention. Room length mirrors, plenty of room for the bridal party to get ready, have their makeup and hair done, and if there's time to relax as well. Drinks were served from 11 onwards, and it has it's own toilets and shower.

From our first meeting at Bredenbury the staff were exceptional. They gave a reassuring air of professionalism and experience, with just the right level of excitedness for our day without it feeling forced. We were really impressed by how responsive the whole team were, with speedy replies to any questions we had during the planning. This is something we particularly appreciated as we only gave ourselves 7 weeks to plan our big day.

Value for money wise it felt tricky to gauge when we were trying to choose a venue as the headline figure is rarely what you'll end up paying, with different venues charging different amounts for different things. Not the case with Bredenbury. With their No Corkage policy and generosity in being able to use whatever props they already have, any extras were non-essentials of our own choosing.

No Corkage is pretty significant. Some venues wanted to charge £20/bottle, so not having to pay this and being able to supply not only our own wine but beers, gin and soft drinks for the drinks reception and wedding breakfast was not only a massive saving but also made the occasion more personal for us. The bar staff and catering team were excellent, pouring and serving drinks, warming our mulled wine and setting up the gin bar. Once your guests have drunk you dry the venue's bar is well stocked and standard pub pricing.

We wanted a Christmas wedding and seeing in early November that they had a date available that December we couldn't resist. 7 weeks isn't long to organise a wedding with nearly 100 guests, and we couldn't have done it without the Bredenbury team being so organised. Our assigned event manager, Harriet, was brilliant in the runup and on the day, as were all the other managers and staff we spoke with. The Wedding Bible they fill out with you is a great idea and nails down all the finer details to ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible on the day.

We didn't want to have to spend the day before and morning of our wedding worrying about set up and decorations, but needn't have worried as Bredenbury did all of this for us. A meeting beforehand clarified what we wanted where; we simply dropped off boxes of stuff the day before and rocked up in the morning to find everything laid out as hoped.

This organisation extended to the third party suppliers, of which Bredenbury have an extensive list of local recommendations. We booked the ceiling lights with Cotswold Wedding Co. and didn't have to do anything else. The band, Apollo Gold (incredible!!) set up without any hassle and didn't have any issues with Bredenbury's noise limiter. Our florist Katrina Bevis hadn't been there before, but again had no problem getting everything in place on the morning.

On-site accommodation was good for close family and friends, but there's not enough for the majority of guests and the lack of a dedicated honeymoon suite is a bit of a shame. If you want privacy for your first night as a married couple it means taking over an entire lodge. The quality and comfort of the rooms is excellent, though, and the continental breakfast served the morning after in the East Lodge was delicious, with ample options for Vegan and Gluten Free.

Jenkinsons are the exclusive caterer for Bredenbury and have an extensive menu for nibbles, the wedding breakfast and dinner. The menu and ordering process is clear, and pricing is what we expected to pay. Food and service was as slick and faff-free as everything else. A real delight.

On the day, Harriet and the catering manager were absolute superstars. Zero stress, everything ran to time and as planned, and they were always available if we had any questions or needed help.

The whole day was perfect and exactly what we wanted. I don't think we could have achieved this without the exceptional organisation of Harriet and the team. The entire process was very slick, zero stress, and we wouldn't hesitate in recommending Bredenbury Court Barns to anyone looking to get married in a countryside paradise."
V95,Bredenbury Court Barns,"I want to say a massive thank you to Bredenbury Court Barns for hosting our wedding. From the start they were super amazing and accommodating to us. They won us over with their care and support even when we had a pickle in the beginning.

Olivia was super helpful from the start and throughout the year we were planning she offered huge amount of support and suggestions.

We typed in “orangery weddings” in google when we were first looking because I was keen to get a ceremony in an orangery and Bredenbury popped up after much searching. Once we saw the Orangery we cancelled every other viewing we had across the country because we felt we found the perfect place, and nothing compared to the reception with the beautiful windows that brought all the light in. The grounds were absolutely spectacular and gorgeous. It was a no brainer for us to pick such a beautiful venue. They brought my ideas to life and we were able to get support on anything from recommendation of suppliers, to ideas on decor to their favourite meals from Jenkinson’s. They fully outdid themselves in love for us. We can’t forget it.

Our wedding day was exceptional with Lianna helping us all the way. She was a breath of fresh air. She cared about all the little details and made us feel relaxed and had a good laugh with us. The fact she was there 100% of the way, before the wedding, during the wedding, and even after is unmatched! Thank you Lianna for really being there to make our wedding day smooth and relaxing.

The food was incredible too and we often think about how sad it is that we didn’t finish our second plates, we think about it a lot.

Thank you for the wonderful journey BCB, you blew us away with your integrity, kindness, and genuine support!"
V95,Bredenbury Court Barns,thank you to everyone at bredenbury court barns who made our day so special
V95,Bredenbury Court Barns,"From the moment we stepped foot into Bredenbury Court Barns, we knew this was the venue for us. It was the first and only venue we viewed as we were blown away by how gorgeous the venue is. The venue itself is absolutely stunning, with breathtaking views and impeccably maintained grounds that set the perfect backdrop for our special day.

The staff went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. From our first consultation to the last dance, their professionalism and attention to detail were exceptional. Harriet was absolutely brilliant and I don’t know what we would have done without her!

The food was another highlight—our guests are still talking about how delicious everything was! Jenkinsons are amazing, they helped us personalise our menu perfectly!

We couldn’t have asked for a more beautiful venue to have our wedding. The day couldn’t have been more perfect! Thank you to everyone at Bredenbury Court Barns for making our wedding day nothing short of magical!"
V95,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We could not have had a more perfect experience with Bredenbury Court Barns. Right from initial booking all the way through to breakfast the following morning, everything was perfect. Nothing was too much trouble for our wonderful planner, Lianna. She ensured the day ran smoothly and our months of planning turned out exactly as we’d imagined. They are available to answer any questions you have any time, they’re only an email away and get back to you so fast. The venue itself if just gorgeous, the grounds make for some wonderful photos, and the orangery lets so much light in that your ceremony photos are gorgeous. The whole place is fully air conditioned too which was great for our July wedding. The bridal suite is a perfect balance of being aesthetically pleasing and practical for getting ready in, it’s so spacious, lots of natural light, there’s plenty of plug sockets and huge mirrors so everyone has plenty of room for getting ready and no one is on top of eachother. There’s even an outside space for getting some fresh air. I’m so glad we chose to have our wedding here, it’s given us memories to cherish forever and there are zero memories of any stress!! Cannot recommend this venue enough!"
V95,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We cannot believe how lucky we fell to get married at such a beautiful venue. Right from the offset of viewing the venue, to our special day, we were taken of. No question was too silly, and so much pressure was taken off us during the planning. We managed to make everything our own and Lianna was there every step of the way. Thank you for giving us our happily ever after. We will forever be grateful."
V95,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We loved our wedding at Bredenbury the team did an amazing job providing everything we asked for and more. We especially liked that our wedding coordinator for the day, Harriet had thought of everything for us she went above and beyond and even offered to go and get my mum some more shoes when hers broke! absolute 5-star service and the food was amazing too!"

V97,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow what can I say, Brinsop is an absolutely stunning wedding venue with heaps of character and so many options of places for the ceremony and to do things. We fell in love with it as soon as we saw it and knew it was where we wanted to get married.

Right from the start, the Brinsop team were so helpful and accommodating. From giving an virtual tour then showing us around in person, Issy and the team were fantastic right the way through. Nothing was a hassle, no request too difficult and they were incredibly professional and responsive throughout the whole process.

We loved that Brinsop is an exclusive venue with accommodation on site so we could stay with the bridal party and our immediate family. All the rooms are unique and have so much character and it's fun exploring the whole place. You feel like you are in the middle of nowhere, in nature with swans, ducks and birds all around.

Throughout our planning process, Issy and the team helped us every step of the way, being incredibly flexible in managing our requests and really trying to create our vision. They even got their team to make a giant jenga that we could use on the day! They helped to create the most perfect bespoke wedding breakfast and canapes menu, and seemed so positive and excited to be part of our special day and experience.

Arriving at the venue, Issy and the team were ready and had everything prepared and ready to go. It made the process so smooth for us and meant we could really enjoy the day without any stress. Issy coordinated perfectly with all of our vendors and it really felt like she and the whole team were so happy for us and wanted to be part of our day which was amazing. Our guests commented on how friendly and responsive all the staff were and it really made the experience extra special.

I wouldn't change anything about the day and it was perfect. I would absolutely recommend Brinsop as a wedding venue and all the staff who are really invested in helping deliver your vision. Thank you so so much to the whole team for making this a day that we will look back on for many years to come with amazing memories."
V97,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow, what a perfect day we had! It really went without a hitch and that was thanks to Nina and all the staff at Brinsop. The team worked seamlessly to ensure the day was as perfect as could be, and it really was! The wedding was booked over 2 years in advance and the staff were so accommodating with all my questions, planning and site visits, they couldn’t do more to support us. Special thanks to our coordinator Nina who was a delight to work with and a credit to Brinsop. Everyone that attended agreed at how beautiful the venue and grounds were, it was a wedding people won’t forget! 10/10 would recommend to anyone!"
V97,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"It's taken me quite a while to get round to writing this review, because sadly it's quite a bittersweet one.

We were married last year on 15 June and Brinsop was our chosen venue for both our ceremony and reception. We were first attracted to brinsop by the accomodation, meaning our loved ones could stay on-site, especially my grandparents which was so important to me.

The home itself is absolutely beautiful, including ivy cottage which myself and my mum stayed in the night before the big day. It really was a picture perfect setting, and looking down from the bridal suite seeing the ceremony space being set up on the Wordsworth lawn was honestly magical. Id dreamed of an outdoor wedding on that lawn, and we were so grateful the weather cleared so we could have it. The team really did wait till the latest they could to ask us to make a call on an inside or outside wedding (despite being June, it was a gloomy day to start) which I really appreciated!

Another amazing part of hiring brinsop was the after hours space we were able to enjoy until 2am with our house guests. The games room was absolute fantastic and meant that if you wanted to go to bed you could, but you could also stay up, party and play pool. I really do think this was a highlight for our guests and would recommend massively if you can spare some budget.

On the night of the wedding, myself and my new husband actually stayed in one glamping tents which we absolutely loved. The groundsman was on site until we were ready to leave the games room, and he then took us up to our tent in one of the buggies, making sure we had plenty of blankets and even stopping off for some bottles of water for us. This was really special, and can't thank him enough.

Hugo Spritz!! Having hugos at both our welcome drinks and drinks reception after the ceremony was amazing. I'm not a fan of prosecco myself and Mark and the team made it possible for us to have Hugo's all round. We even sneaked some up to the bridal suite to have before the ceremony (thanks Nadia!). Our guests loved them, and the amount of people that have told me they now need them at their own wedding is crazy!

Onto the not so good - sadly it all started to go a little downhill when we moved things into the knot barn for our wedding breakfast. Sitting on the top table, I could see that guests at the top of the second rows of long tables didn't really even have a seat around the table and were just kind of plonked on. The seating plan hadn't been followed, and I don't think there were even enough tables laid for the service to be comfortable for people because there was a dance floor at the end of the barn (which I did not ask for).

It was quickly also brought to my attention, that one of our guests had had to put her child on her lap in order to remove the high chair so people had more space. We also lost about 5 napkins with them setting on fire from the candles because everything was just way too cramped.

I asked to speak to catering, and asked if there was anything that they could do. I was told 'well sure, if you want the whole thing to be late'. In truth I shouldn't have even had to broach this myself, as it should have been sorted by the coordination team.

The tables weren't changed, even after they'd said they'd sort after the first course and yet the whole meal still ran late. We've had so much feedback about people not having enough food, food not being easy to access on the sharing platters etc and honestly when you've waited so long for a day and had spent 25k on the venue and food alone, it really has been heartbreaking to hear. I do sometimes question why people still bring it up (even now, people talk about the dining) when it clearly upset me so much.

Whilst writing this review my husband asked my what we had for evening food - we didn't get any. It was left unannounced on a back table. I don't know what I was expecting, just not that.

The next morning, the houseguests were asked to come down to breakfast for 9am (it was on a note in the room) but as we were in the glamping area, we walked past the knot barn just before 8.30 and the food was already out. We ran down to the house to hurry everyone up, and by which time everyone arrived it had been sitting there for 20plus mins going cold.

My biggest upset was that when I fed all of the above back to brinsop, feeling pretty deflated about the catering, I was told they'd pass my feedback on and heard absolutely nothing back. 25k total with over 10k on food and drinks to hear absolutely nothing, and this was 9 months ago. I'm not saying this in would happen to anyone else, but really - it shouldn't have happened to us either."
V97,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our wedding! From start to finish, everything at Brinsop was flawless. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most magical backdrop for our special day. Our guests were blown away by the beautiful venue, the warm atmosphere, and the seamless coordination. Every detail was taken care of, and we felt so well looked after. The team was incredible, professional, friendly, and attentive. On the day itself, they ensured everything ran smoothly, allowing us to truly enjoy every moment. A special mention goes to our amazing wedding coordinator Nina!"
V97,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We had our wedding on New Year's Eve 2024 at Brinsop, and it was more perfect that we could have ever hoped for. The venue itself is stunning, with beautiful spacious rooms which slept over 40 of our guests. Our coordinator, Nina, was incredible and so supportive on the day - she kept everything running so smoothly and everything went by without a glitch. The food and drink managers Mark and Amy did the most incredible job - nothing was ever too much, they were so attentive, and the chefs the most stunning meal after we gave them a fairly vague brief of 'curry'! We had the most perfect day and we're so incredibly grateful to Brinsop and the team."
V97,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,Brinsop Court is pure magic—an unforgettable venue with an incredible team!
V97,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We were lucky enough to have our wedding at Brinsop Court in December, and it was an absolutely spectacular day. We fell in love with Brinsop as soon we set our eyes on the beautiful manor and surrounding gardens. Cate, Amy, Mark and the rest of the wonderful staff at Brinsop really go the extra mile to make you feel special, and are extremely flexible with requests in order to make your day feel more special. We honestly felt like there was no request too big leading up to the day and they really made us feel extremely comfortable leading up to the day.
On the day, Cate and her team were well on hand to help us with setting up everything and she had everything under control when there were a few hiccups. The day itself was absolutely magical, and that wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for everyone at Brinsop working extremely hard to ensure that everything went to plan and as smoothly as it could.
Thank you to everyone at Brinsop for making us feel at ease and ensuring that our wedding was an amazing day."
V97,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Brinsop, the perfect wedding venue! We got married at Brinsop in December and I can honestly say it was everything we could have hoped for and more. We found out about the venue through Hitched and was one of only two venues that we visited but as soon as we got the house we knew it was the one. We fell in love with everything about it and it was fair to say that our guests agreed with us with many saying it was the nicest venue they’d been to. We had the wonderful Nina as our coordinator and she was brilliant! Nothing was too much trouble and we had constant communication with her in the build up which helped our stress levels no end. The same can be said for all of the staff who were brilliant throughout and allowed us to have the best day of our lives with everything running seamlessly. A special mention must be given to Amy and the catering staff who put on such an incredible menu (including the tasting session that provided some of the best food we’d ever had) and ensured that the food has been one of the main things that people have mentioned to us since the wedding! We had our ceremony in the Banqueting Hall which provided the perfect setting, especially with it being a winter wedding, as it really added to the cosy atmosphere and the lounge areas/games room were perfect for the drink’s reception. We would have loved to have also had it in the courtyard, but the temperatures meant that the lounge with the fireplace was a far more appealing option on the day. We then had the wedding breakfast and reception in the knot barn which was decorated beautifully and was the perfect place for the party in the evening. Overall we really can’t thank everyone at Brinsop enough for making our day what it was, we can honestly say that we have been made to feel part of the family and already can’t wait to hopefully come back to stay in one of the cottages for our first anniversary!"
V97,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Where do I start!!
Brinop Court is the most stunning venue, it was the first venue we visited and instantly fell in love! Theres so much history to the house and we were treated like family every time we visited before the wedding and it literally felt like home the whole weekend of the wedding, my guests also agreed!!

A special thank you to Issy our coodinator who went above and beyond ti make sure everything was perfect for us. It was so easy to plan and nothing was too much to ask, even arranging our dog to be our ring bearer!! When they say Brinsop is dog friendly they really mean it!!!

What a place, what a day!! Thank you so much everyone, you all made our day perfect and it really was the best day of our lives♥️"
V97,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We got married at the gorgeous Brinsop in October this year. It’s hard to put into words how amazing the whole experience was. We honestly had the best day of our lives!!!

We fell in love with Brinsop during our first visit back in December 2022. We knew almost immediately that Brinsop was the venue we were looking for! From the outside the venue looked like a painting - from the picturesque views of the countryside, to the swans swimming on the moat! The manor house itself has so much character, and has a lovely homely feel to it as you walk around it. Our guests were equally blown away by the venue!

A big thing for us was that it’s dog friendly, which meant we could have our two dogs join us on our special day, it wouldn’t have been the same without them there! They had so much fun walking around the grounds and greeting all of our guests!

Nina, our coordinator, and her team were always available to answer any of our questions in the run up to the day. This really put us at ease, knowing we were in safe hands. On the day, Nina and the team made sure everything ran smoothly and went above and beyond to ensure our guests were looked after. A shout out to Amy who heads up catering and Mark who manages the bar. The food and drinks were absolutely fantastic!

I highly recommend this venue! There’s a reason Brinsop is an award winning venue - and when you visit it’s not hard to see why. We are already looking forward to going back there for a date night next year! Thanks for everything Team Brinsop!

V98,The Manor at Bickley,"The Manor is the perfect venue for weddings! When our wedding venue fell through 4 months before the big day, I stumbled onto the Manor at Bickley and spoke to Craig. He was most helpful and kind and went above and beyond to make sure our wedding went ahead.

We hired the venue for our two day wedding and the staff were helpful and accommodating from start to finish. All of our guests were awed by the beautiful well kept grounds and the excellent service. We can’t thank the staff enough for making our wedding dreams a reality. They thought of every detail from bringing us champagne after our civil ceremony to making sure we had our card box at the end of the night! We are excited to head back to celebrate our anniversary there!"
V98,The Manor at Bickley,"Myself and my Husband chose this venue for our wedding last week and we can’t sing The Manor’s praises enough. From our very first enquiry, to the first viewing of the venue, right though until the big day, the staff at the manor have been nothing short of brilliant! Each staff member we came across was polite and accommodating. Special mention to Craig and Vicky with whom we did most of our liaising throughout the months leading up until our wedding. Craig and Vicky were super helpful, responsive and went above and beyond to make sure that we could have the day of our dreams. Even with last minute changes due to the weather, Craig who was just incredible throughout, managed to help us sort a backup plan so our day would still go ahead seamlessly.

The rooms at the manor were spacious and modern, giving us and our wedding party lots of space for photographers and videographers to capture the special moments on our wedding morning.

The lodge that was used for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready was fabulous. The manor was very flexible in giving us early access so we could get ready on time.

The grand marquee was definitely grand! Very spacious and when decorated looked like something out of a fairytale! lots of kitchen space, a huge bar and fantastic overhead speakers for the party!

The manor was super flexible to our needs regarding access, start times, outsourcing our vendors and much more. The venue is beautiful and spacious with options for outdoor and indoor events and entertainment. The grounds were absolutely beautiful, so many lovely spots for photos not only for us as the bride and groom but for guests too!

A very special thank you to our point of contact throughout, Craig. From our first meeting, he was charming, bubbly and made us feel super welcome. He reassured us that he has experience in African/Caribbean weddings and that our wedding day would amazing and it was. He was attentive and always let us know that he was only a phone call or e-mail away and was always quick to respond and answer any questions we had.

All in all, we had the most beautiful day at The manor and we would definitely recommend this venue for a wedding or other events.

V98,The Manor at Bickley,"We hired The Manor at Bickley for my daughters wedding. Got a brilliant service from the venue. Everything was set accordingly, as per floor plan. Our guests were loved the venue grounds/facilities and the overall wedding set up.

V99,Davenport House,We are so pleased we chose Davenport House for our wedding reception. Charley and the team were so helpful and thoughtful. Putting canapés behind the bar for us and making sure everything ran so smoothly. I am obsessed with the stunning house and grounds and it was absolutely perfect! Thank you so much for making our day so special!!
V99,Davenport House,"Davenport House is a STUNNING wedding venue so how could we not have it for our big day!?

The staff were exceptional! From the moment we booked through to our big day, we had an absolute blast and could not thank each member of staff enough! Special shout out to Jared (hopefully spelt right, haha!) who made sure we were fed, watered and ensured we took 5 minutes to ourselves every moment we could - Also even saved us slices of pie wedding cake before we went to bed!

Our guests have said they have never been to a wedding so spectacular, with the most amazing food and amazing staff so could not have been happier having Davenport as our venue! 🩷"
V99,Davenport House,"I just wanted to write to say a huge, enormous thank you to Charley and all the team at Davenport House. We still can’t believe how perfect our day was, and lots of our guests have told us it’s the best wedding they’ve ever been to. The team were all a huge part of making that happen. It was incredibly seamless and well planned on the day, meaning we genuinely didn’t have to think about a thing, except for enjoying ourselves. The day ran to schedule perfectly and even certain touches we didn’t know or expect to happen were planned by you and the team, which made the day even more special. Thank you so much for giving us our dream wedding day. We can’t wait to see the full set of pictures and the video now to relive it all!"
V99,Davenport House,"Without doubt the best day of our lives. From start to finish, Davenport has exceeded expectations. From the very first impression of the venue during the open day, the incredible food tasting evening, all the way through to the day itself, including the support and preparation leading up to it. It was really important to us to pick a venue that not only ticked the fairytale box, but also come with the complete support of a wedding planner, due to our busy jobs. We were lucky enough to have Charley as ours. She really took the time to listen and get to know us, to ensure the day was tailored to exactly what we wanted. We even had our own cocktail designed, which went down an absolute storm on the day! She considered every little detail, constantly putting our minds at ease, which made the whole process so easy and enjoyable. Honestly the day couldn’t have gone smoother, any anxiety or stress faded immediately as soon as we got to the venue. It was simply perfect. So many of our guests were complimentary of just how beautiful the venue is and just how well organised the day was, and that is the perfect way to summarise Davenport. Any prospective couples thinking of selecting Davenport as their venue, hesitate no further. It will be a day you never knew was possible! We cannot thank you enough Charley and the Davenport team, if only we could live the day over and over again"
V99,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was amazing. When looking for a venue we weren't just looking for something wow, we needed to have people who were enthused and passionate about their work - we found that at Davenport House.

From our first phone call & meeting with Lizzie and Tallulah, we knew this was the place for us. Having two brides wasn’t an issue; combining British, Asian and Spanish cultures - wasn't an issue; having brides enter together – wasn’t an issue. Nothing was an issue. At Davenport House, we got it all – a picturesque venue and the best team of staff anyone could ever wish for. All our external suppliers have commented what a fantastic venue you are. All out guests have said that the service and attention to detail was second to none. The thoughtful touches like hiring a Spanish speaking waiter for the table which spoke very little English ensured that everyone felt welcomed. Guests with dietary requirements didn't feel they got a second rate meal or they were an afterthought - the food for all throughout the day was exceptional. The rooms / cottages where our guests and we stayed, spotless and comfortable. The thought behind adding some cheese and Spanish ham to the morning breakfast - so sweet!

Special shout out to Megan - wedding planner extraordinaire who kept in touch throughout the planning process and was exceptional on the day. Ian who worked tirelessly to ensure the day ran smoothly and the food was perfect, Charley who was also in charge of one bride and ensuring that everything was on point. All the staff were fantastic - polite, professional and personal.

Everyone keeps saying that this was the best wedding they have ever attended and that’s a lot of weddings between people! When we asked why, they say things like ‘the venue’, ‘the staff’, but it all came back to the inclusivity, love & joy that they felt – and you were all a part of that.

Davenport House is a stunning venue made even better by those who work there. If you want the whole package on your wedding day, we strongly recommend you book them.

Thank you to the entire Davenport House team.

Sat and Ana xx"
V99,Davenport House,"Where to begin with our beautiful venue and thanking the people who made it all happen! We got married in November at Davenport House and it was easily the best day of our lives. We chose Davenport because we wanted to host our cosy winter wedding in a big grand house in the country, with all the grandeur and class but to still feel like an intimate celebration with our family and closest friends, and it was perfect in delivering just that. It is utterly beautiful, the location was perfect and exactly what we wanted. The food was absolutely AMAZING, we had so many compliments from our guests and we are so grateful for the team in delivering such a fabulous wedding breakfast. Thank you so much to Lizzie who couldn’t do more to help us have our dream day, and Ian who delivered the best service to us and our guests (the pizza at 2am was very much appreciated)

Massive massive thank you to Charley our wedding planner, who was so so helpful throughout our wedding planning process and on the day, I can’t thank her enough. She was always there whenever I needed her, helped me so much with creating our dream day and I will be forever grateful to her for keeping me sane! Whenever I had any worries I knew she was just a phone call away, which helped me a lot when planning a wedding!

Charley, Lizzie and Ian thank you for everything - best team ever. Our day was seamless and it was all down to you and your incredible team.

Jess and Sam xx"
V99,Davenport House,"Me and my (now) wife chose Davenport House as our wedding venue in mid 2022, to get married in September 2023, and it was the best decision we could have made. We looked at a range of Georgian style manor house type venues located in Cheshire, North Wales and the West Midlands areas. It blew all of the competition away in terms of the venue aesthetics, the balance in design (i.e. period characteristics vs modern design), the impressive condition of the property for its age plus what it offered for our wedding weekend.

Staff and service - In the UK, this is usually something that is average at best - if you're lucky. At Davenport House, the service from all staff was 10/10. I honestly don't think we've ever had better service for anything. We had a wedding planner from the start (Megan), who was an absolute saint and was fundamental in making the whole wedding a success. She was also instrumental in helping us find a way for our 'little' dog Bernie to be a part of the main event. Thanks Megan!

Accommodation - The fantastic condition, design and decor for Davenport House extends to all areas of the estate. The rooms are fantastic, very big, well maintained and cleaned religiously by the venue. We had no issues or problems from all of the guests who stayed onsite over the 3 days.

Food and drink - This got a lot of deserved praise from the guests too. We got to tailor our entire menu and it worked perfectly for what we wanted for the 3 days. The oyster bar and luxurious charcuterie board went down particularly well the day before the wedding.

I could keep writing much, much more on how fantastic this venue was for our wedding. But the best advice I could give for any interested couples is to go and visit it in person and reach out to Davenport House with any questions. Our own wedding ended up becoming both perfect and the best wedding we've ever been to. Thanks guys again!"
V99,Davenport House,"Fantastic location.
Great staff.
Beautiful place to get married.
I can wait to film here again soon thanks for having me."
V99,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was a fairytale, everything we could have dreamed of and more. Lizzie and Charley were fantastic in their support, organisation and professionalism in planning our wedding. The venue is simply spectacular- breathtaking. Our guests were blown away. The day ran so smoothly it was simply perfect. The food was out of this world our guests couldn't get enough. All the staff at the house went above and beyond to ensure we were happy and having a great day. The team were also extremely supportive of last minute changes/additions. The Davenport experience was truly wonderful and I'm sad to see it end right from our initial meetings, food tasting and finally our special day. Thank you: Lizzie, Charley, Ian and all of the team for a truly memorable day for us and our guests. Mr and Mrs Kissane"
V99,Davenport House,"We got married at Davenport House in February and they provided us with the most perfect day. Lizzie, Charley, Ian and the rest of the team were the best hosts we could have hoped for. Nothing was too much to ask and the guests all commented on the hospitality shown to them. The setting is utterly gorgeous, our weather was less than favourable so we did not make the most of the grounds but this didn't matter, the house was setting enough and so atmospheric! The food was utterly AMAZING and better than most restaurant food I have eaten. The venue feels intimate and grand at the same time.
I literally cannot recommend this place enough, they gave us the wedding we had always wanted and more!"

V101,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge on 12 May 2023 and it was incredible. The views are gorgeous and the photo opportunities are endless with beautiful floral and green surroundings. The team were super responsive throughout the process which is really reassuring and helpful when planning a wedding, and Nelson who ran the day was just fantastic. Every single detail was thought of and they run a really slick operation. This is essential as it meant I had a lot less to think about! They put me and my partner at ease throughout. The food and service on the day was fantastic, so many of our guests said this was the best food they’ve ever had at a wedding. Highly recommend! (Photos by Costa Weddings UK)"
V101,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","Pembroke where super helpful and provided a lot of guidance in helpful forms and layouts. Always available for a call and very helpful. on the day, it ran super smooth and and staff where lovely. Thank yo for making it a great day!"
V101,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge in October 2024. The whole day was magical, including the beautiful view over the autumn trees in Richmond Park. Robert made sure everything ran perfectly and helped us to find slots in the busy wedding timetable to fit in some special moments to also reflect traditions from my husband's Dutch culture. The food was great and the staff were polite and fun. All preparation with Lucy was also smooth and done with a smile. The Pembroke Lodge team ooze experience but make every wedding feel special and really listen to your wishes for the day. Highly recommend! Thank you to the whole Pembroke Lodge team, especially Robert, Lucy, the kitchen team and the staff on the day!"
V101,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park",The staff has been very helpful. They have a lot of experience. Open to any suggestions and help in critical situations.
V101,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue than Pembroke Lodge for our summer wedding. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most gorgeous backdrop for our special day. A huge thank you to our banqueting manager, Nelson, who went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly.

The team was incredibly supportive and accommodating throughout the planning process, making it an enjoyable and stress-free experience. Their professionalism and attention to detail made all the difference, and we’re so grateful for everything they did to make our day unforgettable. Highly recommend!"
V101,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We got married on the 3rd of October this year, and the team made our day magical! What a smooth day. We loved every second of it! The guests loved everything, and raved about the food and organisation.
Hiring Pembroke Lodge was easy. We had a viewing where all information was shared in detail and super clear to understand and make a decision.
On the months leading up to the big day our contact was Alice. Alice is a star. Responsive, professional, and had answers and solutions to everything.
On the day, Nelson coordinated the whole thing, minute by minute, and we are forever grateful for his politeness, professionalism and high spirits. We felt safe and in good hands. I would give Pembroke Lodge way over 5 stars if I could :)"
V101,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","My wedding went without a hitch, thanks to the amazing team at Pembroke Lodge (special thanks to Nicola & Robert)! They made sure everything was set up perfectly on the day, exactly in the way we had requested, and then ensured the day itself went as smoothly as we could've hoped. Everything looked beautiful and the stunning views made all of our guests fall in love with the venue too."
V101,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had the most perfect day. The team have all been so responsive and accommodating of our every request. The venue is beautiful and we were lucky to have gorgeous sunset views. It is truly a countryside wedding but conveniently close to London, which was important for our overseas guests. The food was fantastic and staff were professional and efficient. Would recommend to anyone."
V101,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We recently had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge, and I cannot say enough good things about the venue, the team and manager, Robert. From the moment we started planning to the big day itself, he was absolutely incredible.

Robert went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. He was always available to answer our questions, offer solutions, and provide creative suggestions that enhanced our vision. He coordinated effortlessly with our vendors, making sure everyone was on the same page, which took so much stress off our shoulders.

On the day of the wedding, he was a true rockstar! He made sure the timeline flowed perfectly, from setting up the ceremony space to ensuring the reception transitions were seamless. His dedication and hands-on approach allowed us to enjoy every moment without worrying about a single thing.

Our wedding was a dream come true, and we owe so much of that to him and the team! Thank you, for everything you all did to make our day magical."
V101,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We could not have wished for a better wedding venue for our special day! Everyone went above and beyond to make sure our day goes perfectly without us having to worry about a single thing! A big shoutout to Nelson who was absolutely brilliant and made the day feel so calm and well thought through.

The food was delicious and all the team was so welcoming and super helpful on the day.

Thank you so much, we really really appreciate all the help!"
V102,The Hackney,"If you are having a wedding for under 60 people then this is your place! From start to finish the communication and planning of the wedding was seamless and took so much of the stress out of the day. The totally customisable packages that they offer really does suit anyone’s budget and more importantly regardless of what package you end up going for it is value for money. The food was delicious and it catered to everyone’s tastes including a pregnant guest, halal, vegan and lactose intolerant and was the talking point for our guests. The venue itself is stunning! Lots of exposed brick, they had recently redecorated before our wedding and the reception room that doubled up as the dance floor was styled simply but made a statement and the outdoor covered patio area was a welcome addition. The team understood our vision from the get go and they completely nailed it, all of our guests couldn’t believe it was here! I honestly can’t recommend it enough if you’re wanting a small and intimate wedding venue but still with all the class. I would say to future couples even if you think this wouldn’t be your venue please please do have a proper look because it will change your mind, I had come across this venue multiple times over the course of a year and decided to take a leap of faith and give it a chance and we’re so happy we did."
V102,The Hackney,"We can’t recommend the Hackney highly enough. They made the whole process so easy and they offer so much in-house which we took advantage of. The food was especially great - our guests were amazed “best food I’ve ever had at a wedding” and the team took great care of us during the planning stages.

They offer a very customisable service with scalable pricing. If you’re having a fairly small wedding (under 60) then you must check out The Hackney.

We had such a perfect day and we owe so much of that to the fabulous venue. Beautiful space, so professionally run."
V102,The Hackney,"We had such a brilliant experience working with the team at The Hackney. We were regularly in touch throughout the planning process and the use of the shared spreadsheet was especially handy for keeping everyone informed.
We had to postpone our wedding two days before as we were both sick with COVID, and the team were just fantastic. They waited for us to recover and then we started to talk through options again. We were able to rebook just six months after our original date, and the team were accomodating and understanding throughout the process.
The day itself was perfect. Lots of our guests commented on the quality and quantity of the food and Hugo was great at keeping everything to time. We wish we could do it all again."
V102,The Hackney,"We had our wedding reception here and wow was it amazing. Hugo, Erika and the whole team were amazing. Every single guest commented on how delicious and plentiful the food was. The staff were amazing nothing was too much to ask and all so happy.
The venue itself was decorated amazingly, given we left our wedding stationary etc up to the venue it exceeded our expectations. I was concerned about the allowed decibel level for Dj / entertainment but it was plenty loud enough. I wish I could relive the day again, if you’re thinking about booking The Hackney do it! You will not regret!"
V102,The Hackney,"We held our wedding reception at The Hackney in July and it was truly the best experience. We opted for a standing reception for our 65 guests, serving food bowl-style for a more relaxed, less formal feel. The food was absolutely delicious and there was lots of it - it just kept coming! Our guests are still raving about how good the food was months later! Lots of good drinks options too - we especially like the cocktails here!

The staff on the night were so friendly, welcoming and were amazing with our children guests too!

The Hackney is such an aesthetic venue with exposed brick walls and existing foliage which we loved, so we kept additional decorations to a minimum. We dropped our decorations to The Hackney the day before and picked them up the day after, which was super easy! We hadn’t given them too much direction with where we wanted everything placed but when we turned up to the venue on the day it was truly perfect! The staff know exactly what they’re doing and had decorated it beautifully! The outdoor seating area is a great feature too (especially for our two greyhounds who chilled out there for the majority of the reception!)

We opted for a simple Spotify playlist for our music and their sound system was good.

The wedding planning process was super easy from start to finish, with continued support and check-ins from Hugo, from the moment we booked, to the day itself! We really enjoyed the menu tasting experience earlier in the year too, which is a great touch in the build up to the big day! The planning spreadsheet was easy to use and made us feel content and relaxed, knowing that everything was under control.

Overall, we would highly recommend The Hackney to anyone looking for an affordable, dog-friendly, wedding reception venue with a laidback vibe, delicious food and lovely friendly staff! We look forward to coming back every year to celebrate our anniversary, with an espresso martini!"
V102,The Hackney,"We hosted our wedding reception with the team at the hackney in May 2023. The planning experience was straight forward and easy to book. The availability for the venue is on the website so easy to see when they have and get it booked. We went with the 5 canapés, bowl food menu, and drinks on arrival with wine through the event. The staff were brilliant and food delicious.

We loved the vibe of the venue as we wanted a bit more of a casual event, with a relaxed feel and we were able to host our 85 guests with no issues (although limited to standing event at this size, there is enough scattered seating for anyone to sit when they wanted).

In terms of decorating, we didn't feel the need to add any extra flowers as the venue was already so made up with plants and other decorations.

We did add the photo box which I highly recommend, was great fun for our friends and family and came with a memory book. People were shy at first but really got into it. We also used the recommended baker who provided a delicious cake.

Final area to mention - pricing. Wedding venues can be really expensive and daunting before you even start paying for any food or drink. Something that really attracted us to this venue was the low spacing cost and the minimum spend with it. It meant that we were able to completely customise the experience and see where the money we were spending was going. There are many different options and packages to go with, so it's up to you.

Only thing that wasn't offered was any tasting of the food beforehand which we would've liked to have done but none the less, the food was delicious so it wasn't really needed!

To finish, we loved every moment of it and hope that many others get to experience the same. Thank you very much team at the hackney!"
V102,The Hackney,"We had our reception in July. The venue was cosy and comfortably fit 30 people without feeling too crowded or too empty (we were worried it might be too empty). We managed to fit a band in, arranged mini-golf in the venue after dinner, and customize the cocktail menu with custom recipe (that we provided before hand).

One of the biggest highlights was the food. The crispy roast pork got so many complements and indeed it was tasty. But really, all the dishes were amazing (we had a tasting session prior), it was hard to choose, but the taste of each dish was still top notch on the day itself too. I heard that the supper snacks we ordered were great too but alas, I was too busy and they were snapped up instantly!

Some other details:
* We were allowed to use the small room downstairs as a private space to put our stuff. Very handy to not mess up items.
* We went with a bar tab and kept increasing the budget each time till the end of the night instead of the all-you-can-drink. From our rough calculations, it worked out about the same going for all-you-can-drink. Of course, certain folk were heavy weights and more than made it up will be different for each crowd.
* Lighting for photos came out excellent (combination of photographer and venue lighting).
* You can adjust air conditioning to suit the weather (we had ours on the warm side due to older folk not dealing with cold too well).
* Outdoor space was a pleasant change in atmosphere for those who wanted some fresh air.

What about the review from the Bride? Bride approved this review."
V102,The Hackney,"The day was fabulous - Hugo was brilliant and flexible with what we were after. The tasting day before was such a great idea and the whole experience and guidance given made planning a wedding in c.5 months so much easier. We had vegans, last minute drop outs, ridiculously hot weather, about 3 different spotify playlists, a string quartet, florists arriving in the morning and a cake that arrived the day before - the team took it all in their stride and it seemed like a breeze. Loved it all and we've had such good feedback from guests. A fabulous whirlwind.

Two very minor points for feedback - we maxed out the guest numbers (the team did advise us against it but were very accommodating despite us also throwing musicians into the mix) and it was a little too crowded pre-lunch on such a hot day. We also put some speeches in between courses (again, we were recommended against it) and that may have been a slight mistake for the dessert timings, as the tasting day was 10/10. But, it was a perfect day in a stunning venue. Loved it - thank you guys."
V102,The Hackney,"Jon and the team were absolute superstars, hosting the perfect wedding day for us. The space is beautiful, the decor is modern and perfect. They were so accommodating for any request or question we had which we really appreciated. Guests commented on how great the cocktails were! The day ran so smoothly and we had a fantastic time."
V102,The Hackney,"From the initial phonecall to the warm welcome we got when we first visited The Hackney, we knew we were in safe hands and that we’d made the perfect choice. The venue offers the most beautiful interiors - the perfect mix of cosy, intimate and modern industrial - exactly what we were looking for!

Our entire experience with The Hackney was an absolute dream -we loved the mega organised approach to planning. Something that could have been incredibly intimidating was made so straightforward with the amazing support of Hugo the General Manager who embraced all our weird and wonderful suggestions and gave expert advice on what we could do to make things even better. We left every meeting buzzing with ideas and even more excited to welcome our closest friends and family to the big day.

The quality of the food and drinks is impeccable - every single one of our guests (even the fussiest!) has commented on how much they loved it. We absolutely loved the menu tasting, even though it made the decision even harder as everything was amazing. What makes it even better for us is living close by and being able to pop into our wedding venue for a coffee or a cocktail!

I couldn't recommend The Hackney enough - I just wish we could go back and do it all again!"
V103,PYRÁ,"We held our wedding reception at Pyra. We booked the entire venue, with the upstairs loft serving as a dance floor with bar and downstairs having tables and seating for guests.  Canapes were served upstairs and a buffet dinner was served downstairs.  We lucked out with great April weather, so guests were also able to enjoy Pyra’s patio and additional space on Lonsdale Road. We were very happy with our decision to have our reception at Pyra, and many of our guests commented on how lovely the space was, how nice the staff were, and how delicious the food was.
 
The venue:
The space is gorgeous with lots of natural light upstairs.  Guests arrived at 4pm but we had the venue for the entire day, and Pyra gave our florist access earlier to set up beautiful flower arrangements and candles - it looked stunning.  Pyra set up our welcome sign and card box too. The venue also accepted delivery of our cake on the morning of the wedding which was a huge help, set it up very nicely upstairs, and cut it for us after the formal “cake cutting” shots.  We were able to coordinate with Pyra ahead of time to arrange the space how we wanted, such as how many tables we wanted downstairs and the set-up of the loft upstairs.  They even had a microphone ready for us upstairs so we could say a few words to our guests before our cake cutting. Perfect! For the evening dancing, we were able to set the disco lighting to our colour scheme, which worked really well with candles and foliage (latter 2 provided by our florist).
 
The food:
The buffet dinner was fantastic.  Pyra gave us multiple menu items to choose from and we were able to fix a nice menu that took into account guests’ dietary restrictions.  We initially booked the venue when it had a different chef and menu.  We came in a few months before our wedding to try the new menu – our dinner was delicious then and there was no dip in quality for the buffet-style served at our reception. Fionn worked with us how to plan best - because we wanted a relaxed style with a dance floor upstairs, we ended up feeding our 80 guests in two sittings downstairs, which worked perfectly. The upstairs space can seat 60 people, which didn’t work for how we planned our event, but does look really nice in photos. The late night food served around 10pm also went down very well.
 
The staff:
The staff, including the bartenders and waiters, were hardworking, friendly and very nice to guests.  Enough staff were around that guests never had to wait long for drinks.  Members of staff cut our cake for us and also boxed up the late night food for guests to bring home.  Fionn, the day-of coordinator, was on-site for our entire reception and was very helpful, even helping coordinate our midnight bus arrival.
 
Responsiveness:
Overall we were happy with the responsiveness of the venue.  It took a little while to nail down the final details of the food menu and drinks menu/bar tab but we were ultimately very happy with the result.  As the venue hosts more weddings/ larger-scale events we’d expect this will improve.

Overall:
We highly recommend Pyra for a wedding reception. We had 80 guests in total, which worked very well for the canapes/cocktail hour upstairs (4-6pm), sit-down buffet downstairs (6-8pm, split into two seatings) and dancing upstairs (8pm-midnight).  The upstairs loft was able to fit all 80 guests plus a four-piece band.  Lonsdale Road is also a charming street that provided great photo opportunities.  We looked into several other venues, and came away happy with Pyra's quote – we were able to book the venue, food (including canapes, dinner and late night food) and a generous bar tab for roughly the amount some other London venues were charging for just their space (no food or drink included). We and our guests had a fantastic time. Thanks so much to Fionn and the Pyra team :)"
V103,PYRÁ,"We had our wedding celebration at Lula. We booked the loft and restaurant for this.

Positives:
The venue is beautiful and needs minimal decoration.
The food was amazing; the chef is truly professional and everyone loved it.
They redecorated the restaurant section and added a set of couches to make it a lounge, which was beautiful.
The staff was very hardworking, professional, and lovely.

They provided us with a lounge, a wedding breakfast space and a dance floor.

Flexibility with Cake:
The bakery was scheduled to deliver and set up the cake at 16:45, but they delivered it at 09:45 instead. The Lula team handled the situation professionally by storing the cake and setting it up at the correct time. They presented the cake beautifully and assisted in cutting it into nice pieces. It could not have been more perfect.


The list of available drinks was huge, and they were happy to make custom drinks and bring in different juices if requested in advance. The event manager tried to accommodate every wish we had, and on the day we could not have hoped for more. Most of our guests said it was one of the best weddings and most beautiful venues they had ever been to.

Negatives:
Food tasting for the wedding menu was not included, which we had assumed would be, but it was given at a 50% discount. We had to sort out the floral decoration last minute, as they had initially suggested they would arrange it for us after providing a budget, but later said we needed to find our own. At times, they were a bit slow to respond, which made us anxious, but after communicating with them, this was resolved, and communication was very swift.

In conclusion:
Lula gave us the most beautiful wedding we could have dreamt of. We highly recommend them. The venue, the food, the service were amazing, and we could not have hoped for more."
V104,Sandon Manor,"We had such a special wedding at Sandon Manor, the team made every effort to make our day so so special and we will be forever grateful for that. A dream team! The day ran so smoothly and they worked so hard. The venue is unique with lots of different spaces which unfold throughout the day, which was perfect as our wedding fell on a wet and windy autumnal day. We would highly recommend Sandon Manor!"
V104,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor provided the perfect venue for our wedding. From the initial conversations and meetings with the team, we knew we were in safe hands and had made the right choice. They kept us informed with any events, made information a bit payments clear and reassured us with any query we had.
The accommodation was exceptional and fitted our requirements perfectly, with high quality finishing touches throughout to ensure our stay was as comfortable as possible.
The wedding venue was incredible! Our ceremony took place in the gorgeously modern barn with stunning draping and greenery. Following on, we had a blissful drinks reception which was on the expertly manicured lawn (with mini golf!) and sun-trap of a courtyard. We then moved onto our wedding breakfast which was held in the main barn, seating all of our guests comfortably with space for decor and extra details. Following from dinner, the part started and the club room came to life! This was absolutely the talking point of the day and our guests raved about how incredible it was! It managed to create a club-like atmosphere, whilst maintaining the vibe, albeit at a reduced volume, in the rest of the barn. The layout of the venue was important to us, as it ensured our guests never strayed too far, to keep the momentum of the day.
The team at Sandon worked superbly with all of vendors which ensured the day ran smoothly from set up to clearing. All of our vendors commented on how much they too loved working there.
The venue, the aesthetics, the staff, everything was perfect! We would absolutely recommend to anyone getting married."
V104,Sandon Manor,"We cannot recommend Sandon Manor enough. From the quality of the service, the helpfulness and friendliness of the team, the beautiful accommodation and the most amazing venue which all or guests loved partying the night away in. To make it even more special the Manor is in amazing grounds in beautiful countryside and nature reserves.
Sandon Manor made our dream come true."
V104,Sandon Manor,"I couldn't recommend Sandon Manor highly enough - from our first enquiry to our Wedding, nothing was too much trouble. The team are so friendly and easy to communicate with, very approachable and responsive. They respond to any questions immediately and having the day before to set up with Tom was fantastic. Styaying in the Manor House and Dovecote was the icing on the cake as to be with friends and family the night before and the day after was so fabulous. On the day Tom and the team were absolutely fantastic and couldn't have done more to make our special day. We couldn't have dreamt of anywhere more perfect than Sandon Manor - a huge thank you to all the staff."
V104,Sandon Manor,"If you are considering Sandon Manor for your wedding venue, I beg you: scratch it off your list now. Yes, the house and grounds are beautiful, but the people behind it are absolutely awful. They ruined our wedding experience.

I will get straight to it. Sandon Manor has a very strict policy on guests leaving the site by 11:30pm (and no one is allowed back to the Manor unless they’re official guests staying overnight). We had lots of international guests at our wedding. Many hadn’t seen each other in years and would be jetlagged - we thought they may be keen to continue chatting after 11:30pm. With this in mind, we made a booking with Sandon Village Hall via our contacts at the church (where we were attending services and later married). They granted us access to the village hall until 1am as a contingency spill over space.

We mentioned this in passing during our online meeting with one of the Sandon Manor team a month before our wedding. Within hours, I received a voicemail from the lady in charge of Village Hall bookings saying (quote) “someone at Sandon Manor is trying to throw a spanner into the works for you”. It soon transpired that they had raised an official complaint to the parish council and pressurised the village hall team into cancelling our booking. To be clear, Sandon village Hall and Sandon Manor are entirely separate entities – there is no crossover between them whatsoever, as the owner of Sandon Manor later acknowledged.

It gets worse. Gob smacked, we asked Kate – the owner of Sandon Manor – for a call to find out what was going on. She was abhorrent, trying to justify her meddling as a necessary measure to protect her wedding license (side note: with Sandon Manor it is always about the money – once your deposit is paid they care nothing for your ‘special day’; you are just another cash cow). Did she apologise for stabbing us, her clients, in the back? No, she did not. She could not even fathom how hurt we were by being completely bypassed in the communication chain and how deceitful and disrespectful this was. My husband and I were quite literally left speechless. We’ve never experienced this sort of treatment from anyone, let alone our wedding venue - to whom we were paying many thousands of pounds. Dealing with this stress in the final month of wedding prep really took its toll on us and soured things. We no longer looked forward to our day, rather dreaded what Sandon Manor might do next.

Aside from this major incident, there were many other occasions when Sandon Manor were unhelpful and unfeeling in their interactions with us:

- We enquired if it would be possible to arrange a large pizza takeaway order instead of using Sandon Manor’s caterer for our late night food. One of the team explained on a call that this wasn’t contractually possible; we acknowledged this. We then received an email saying ‘If you are unable to follow this or any other of our T&C's we would be happy to cancel your booking.’ This was less than a month before our wedding.
- We had a harpist perform in the church. We were told she wasn’t allowed to play during our drinks reception in the grounds due to potential noise complaints (an acoustic harp at 2pm in the afternoon). No other music was permitted outside the house.
- Sandon Manor is an incredibly expensive (in hindsight, grossly overpriced) venue. But we were also hit with hidden fees when booking their accommodation option - an extra £425 ‘cleaning fee’ was added to our bill.
- At the time of booking, Sandon was running a promotion waivering the £700 fee for hiring their ceremony space. As we were marrying at the church, we asked if it would please be possible to put this towards other elements of our day i.e. using their festoon string of lights in the barn (for which they charge £450). They refused.
- We were unsure about booking the 1-bed Dovecote on the grounds as - at £499 for the weekend - it was a considerable expense. While we were deciding Sandon Manor rented it out on Air BnB (to one of our guests, which made for a very awkward conversation).

To summarise, you only get one wedding day. Kate and her team absolutely ruined ours. There are so many other lovely venues in north Hertfordshire run by decent, humane people. Please prioritise your happiness and choose wisely. I wish we had."
V104,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor is a stunning wedding venue with a great team behind it. The exclusive use of the manor for the weekend was a highlight, allowing us to relax with friends and family in the lead up to and after the big day. The Sandon team were brilliant, guiding us through the planning process and ensuring everything ran smoothly on the day. We couldn't have asked for a better place and team to help us celebrate our big day."
V104,Sandon Manor,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our special day. Holly, Tom and the rest of the brilliant team made us feel welcome from day one. Special mention to Tom for making the day run so seamlessly, so professional and accommodating of all our needs.

The venue itself is stunning, located in the beautiful Hertfordshire countryside. The Manor House makes for a tremendous location to prepare, and the Dovecote suite is a nice touch: a great addition for the groom to spend the last night. We loved the small details of the characteristic main venue, with the botanical feel to the bar a great backdrop to the barn.

It’s a shame we can’t stay every week!

Dan & Suzanne"
V104,Sandon Manor,"To Holly, Louise, Tom & Kate, wow, what can we say but the biggest thank you for the best day of our lives! When we viewed the beautiful venue over two years ago we just knew instantly Sandon Manor was the one, not just because it’s stunning, but you guys are amazing! Thank you for making all our wedding dreams come true. Forever grateful and can’t wait to return to reminisce. Lots of love, the new Mr & Mrs Jakes xxx"
V104,Sandon Manor,"From the moment we visited Sandon Manor we knew this would be our wedding venue for 9 September 2023. Seeing the spectacular finish of the house carry through to the completed venue just shows the high level of attention to detail this venue had to offer.

Holly, Tom and the rest of the team filled us with confidence right from our first interactions, annd went above and beyond on the wedding weekend itself to facilitate us, our suppliers and guests. The main house, dovecote, annex and extensive grounds were a wonderful way to have close family stay with us on site, and so handy to be able to all get ready nearby the morning of.

Thank you for making our wedding weekend a truly memorable occasion, for us and our families. We all look back on this day with the happiest, sunniest memories and Sandon Manor will always have a very special place in our hearts."
V104,Sandon Manor,"We had the most amazing wedding weekend at Sandon Manor.

The venue itself is the perfect backdrop for a wedding, our photos looked amazing from every single angle. There were so many spaces to make use of throughout the day which helped things to run incredibly smoothly and meant we didn’t need to have a ‘turnaround’ during the evening. The spaces really wowed our guests and created such a lovely atmosphere. Including the ‘club room’ dance floor that had our guests dancing until the very last song!

We stayed at the Manor House for the weekend, extending our wedding into a perfect weekend retreat. The house itself is beautiful, with lots of different areas for everyone to relax, and the perfect peaceful location to chill the night before the big day!

From our first viewing to checking out the day after our wedding, the Sandon staff were attentive, friendly and helped us feel relaxed and looked after throughout an otherwise overwhelming process. We’d highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for a beautiful, peaceful and unique wedding venue!"
V105,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Thank you so much to the entire team for making our wedding so special! Thanks to Donique, MJ, Mo, Harry and everyone else for helping us organise our day and for their professional but friendly attitude. Merchant Taylors is such a beautiful venue and offers a brilliant layout and different spaces to make the day so special!"
V105,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you all so very much for such an amazing wedding on Saturday. You all worked tirelessly to make it so special. Everything was truly wonderful and you all did me proud! Both Hugh and I couldn’t have asked for anything more in terms of being so well looked after. Our guests were so impressed and have given us so many compliments on a brilliantly well run event. Thank you all again for playing a brilliant part in our truly wonderful day of which we loved every minute
V105,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you so much for the most wonderful wedding reception at the end of April. We had the perfect day and our guests all commented on how well looked after they has been. Thank you again for all your hard work!
V105,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"We know this is very late (we have no excuse), but we wanted to say thank you for everything you and the team at Merchant Taylor's did for us on our wedding day. All the guests have since told us how much they loved the venue, food and service. Fingers crossed you get a few couples getting in touch! Again, Thank You for everything!"
V105,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"My brother and I attended the wedding today, as Florist's for the wedding party.
We were treated fantastically well by ALL the staff that we met, nothing was too much trouble and they made our task a COMPLETE pleasure.
If this is how they treat the actual wedding party then you will have a unforgettable time. Many thanks to all the staff for helping us to do our job with ease ."
V105,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Zara,

Can we thank you and your team at Merchant Taylor’s Hall for all your hard work in making Caroline and Neil’s recent wedding so very special. You, in particular, were able to deal with every question and request in a really professional manner.

Merchant Taylors’ Hall is part of the rich panoply of history and tradition, which makes this great City. All of our guests, and in particular those from abroad, were totally spell bound by the atmosphere, the food and service.

James was superb in organising the whole operation. To turn the Great Hall from a wedding ceremony hall to a banqueting suite for 110 guests, including flowers, place settings and dance floor in ninety minutes was truly remarkable.

The food and wine was of an amazing standard, we know that Merchant Taylors’ Hall has a reputation for presenting some of the finest dining in the City of London. You certainly surpassed all expectations.

We have many wonderful memories of the 10th September 2016, but it is best summed up by our daughter Caroline, “Can we do it all over again?”."
V106,Garden Museum,I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate everything that you did to make our party such a success last Friday. It was brilliant being outside on such a lovely everning. Everyone was very impressed with the venue.
V106,Garden Museum,"Thank you for all your help, advice and on-the-day support, it really made our wedding very special and it certianly went off without a hitch! The Museum looked amazing and the garden was perfect, especially as the sunshine adn the guests wanted to make the most of the beautiful surroundings."
V107,Clearwell Castle,"Can’t tell you how wonderful the team were at Clearwell. Our wedding coordinator Phaedra was exceptional. Attention to detail and everyone of the team from front of house, waiting staff, groundsmen and the DJ made our day absolutely everything we dreamed of and unique to us.

Can’t recommend highly enough and cost was outstanding value for money.

So many our guest commented on the quality of the food and that it was the best wedding they had been too! The children loved the magic of the castle and opportunity to get outside and see the grounds.

The grooms family had a fabulous time staying in the cottages the night before and our guests at both the Castle & the Wyndham had a fabulous stay on the night of the wedding.

Wish we could do it all again!"
V107,Clearwell Castle,We had our wedding at Clearwell in June and we couldn’t recommend it highly enough. From start to finish everything was perfect and they went above and beyond to ensure we had an amazing day. I’d not hesitate in recommending them to any couples. Just a gorgeous place with staff that really care in making your day all that you hope it will be.
V107,Clearwell Castle,"From the moment we first visited Clearwell, we knew this was the venue for us. From the moment we started planning to the final touches on the day, all the staff were fantastic. Ann, our wedding coordinator, was a delight to work with throughout. Nothing was too much trouble and she kept us updated throughout. The day was tailored exactly to our needs and when we arrived at the venue on the day they had prepared everything perfectly.

We did the night before package which included rooms and food the evening before. We were supplied with so much food no one went hungry. The rooms in the Wyndham and the Castle are fantastically appointed.

The venue itself is gorgeous. The cellar bar downstairs adds a whole different dimension to the occasion where you can really let your hair down.

This was an absolute dream come true venue for us. We loved every single minute."
V107,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot fault this venue at all. We initially had to change our wedding date because of lockdown and they were so supportive and empathetic.
Ann, our coordinator, is quite possibly the loveliest person on the planet. She was always happy to answer any questions and it never felt like we were being a nuisances or asking a silly question.
On the morning of the wedding she was a lovely calm presence and the whole day just ran like clockwork.
The food was out of this world with many guests saying it was the best food they’d had at a wedding and one person actually thought we’d hired a Michellin Chef!
The venue is so so beautiful with plenty of space. The downstairs cellar was a great place to party the night away, it was like an exclusive nightclub. There were lots of quieter rooms for people who wanted some peace.
The DJ was brilliant, we forgot to give a list of songs we liked but he did a great job of guessing what we liked ( he must’ve looked at our age and figured nineties dance music was our era. And he was bang on the money)
I do not have a single complaint about this venue"
V107,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot speak highly enough about Clearwell Castle as a wedding venue. The venue itself is absolutely stunning. It rained on our wedding day but the indoor space was so vast and beautiful that ourselves and our guests still had the most amazing time! Our wedding co-ordinator, Phaedra, was absolutely incredible, both before and during the wedding. She was always so professional, replied to all of my emails (there were many) and answered all queries efficiently. On the day, we genuinely could not have managed without her. The day flowed so well with her guidance and it really helped me as the Bride as I felt I didn't need to worry about anything! All the other staff at Clearwell and at the Wyndham hotel were also so wonderful! Everyone worked so hard and every member of staff was so kind to us; it just made our day incredibly special and we are so appreciative to them all. The food was great, service very quick and all the guests really enjoyed it! We had so many compliments about the staff and venue! I honestly could not recommend Clearwell castle more as a wedding venue!"
V107,Clearwell Castle,"Our wedding on 10/11/23 was just the absolute perfect day from start to finish. Our wedding planner manager, Hannah, was incredible, not just on the day but throughout the whole planning process. She ensured everything ran smoothly on the day, sparing no details ensuring everything was just perfect and to time but without being stressful. She was very accommodating with the planning meetings working around both mine and my now Husband's shift patterns.
We both stayed the night before our wedding and the night of the wedding with many of our guests travelling a distance so also staying in the Wyndham which was very convenient. Staying in Keepers cottage with the Bridesmaids the night before added to the experience with the added feature of the hot tub, the groomsmen were very jealous. The beds were very comfortable and everyone was excited to stay in a castle.
On the day of the wedding, the staff were very accommodating moving the bridal party along to the bridal suite to finish preparations earlier than originally planned. The breakfast provided was the perfect amount for a busy morning getting ready. Everything, including the gardens, were immaculately kept adding to the WOW factor of getting married in a Castle.
The canapes served and welcome drinks were well received by the guests and ourselves whilst we had photographers prior to the wedding breakfast. The food was phenomenal and great portions and I was stuffed after. The staff were very accommodating for us with a lot of people with allergies, dislikes of mushrooms so adapting the menu for these individual people. We were even able to swap out a few bottles of wine included in our package for cocktails as us as the Bride and Groom did not drink wine.
As soon as we walked in the venue the first time, we knew it was the place we wanted to get married. Everytime we went back to view the venue again I fell more and more in love. For anyone thinking about viewing or even booking this incredible venue I would say do it! We will be going back for events in the future to relive the best day of our lives."
V107,Clearwell Castle,"We got married at Clearwell castle April 2023. What can I say it's the most perfect venue and we had the most amazing day. The organisation was amazing and the staff were great on the day and even leading up to the big day. Phaedra was our wedding planner and communication with her was great throughout and on our wedding day she ensured that it all ran smoothly. I cannot recommend Clearwell castle and their staff enough. Thank you again for helping us have our dream wedding.
Kind regards

Vanessa & David x"
V107,Clearwell Castle,"We had the most amazing wedding day on the 24th of November 2023, the whole day ran so smoothly and all our guests absolutely loved the venue. The food was amazing and our guests loved the fish and chip buffet in the evening! The whole progress of planning the wedding was so straight forward and Phedera was a great wedding manager."
V107,Clearwell Castle,"Clearwell Castle exceeded all our expectations for our wedding day. The moment we stepped onto the grounds, we were captivated by its timeless charm. The staff, especially Hannah, went above and beyond to make every detail perfect, ensuring a seamless and stress-free experience. The Ball Room, where we exchanged our vows, felt like something out of a storybook. The surrounding gardens provided a stunning backdrop for photos and added to the overall enchantment of the day. Our guests were equally impressed, and many commented on the unique and romantic atmosphere. Choosing Clearwell Castle was the best decision we made for our special day; it truly felt like a fairy-tale come to life."
V107,Clearwell Castle,"We had the perfect wedding at Clearwell Castle, their team were superb in providing planning assistance from the point of our booking, guidance on all aspects of our wedding choices from registrars and suppliers, and coordination on the day of the wedding to make sure it flowed seamlessly. It was a beautiful day, and we couldn't be happier with our choice of Wedding location."
V108,Inner Temple,We got married here in 2023. Everything was perfect and the team made sure the day/food etc was just as we wanted it. Particular thanks to Priya and Eva (Pegasus) for their hard work making our wedding day and lead up so special.
V109,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"I got married at Dodford Manor in February this year. A great time was had by all and I will be recommending the venue to any friends planning weddings.

The weather was bad on the day so we didn’t get to use the outside area very much, but it didn’t matter as the inside is so lovely.

Sky was really helpful and put me at ease on the day. Questions in the lead up and on the day were answered quickly and I was made to feel like the only bride in the world!"
V109,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford was the first venue we looked at shortly after we got engaged. The staff were friendly and relaxed when we had a tour, I knew it was the place for us! I think Lydia telling my now husband that we couldn’t have fireworks due to the animals nearby but we could have a fire performer outside, sold the deal for us! I got an amazing fire performer as a surprise for my husband and the guests after we had sparklers, and it just completed an amazing day!
We heard such positive things Dodford about how professional and smooth running weddings have been from our suppliers, and you guys didn’t disappoint. You handled the day so well, we didn’t worry about a thing and just enjoyed ourselves the whole day.
We honestly had so many lovely messages and conversations after our wedding about how the venue was amazing, everything and everyone was catered for, from my 88 year old Nan, to young children who could play and enjoy the outdoors with a scoop of amazing ice cream. We honestly couldn’t have asked for a better day, we would do it again in a heartbeat if we could! Thank you for making the day so seamless! We are eternally grateful to everyone at Dodford for making our dreams come true becoming Mr and Mrs Price!"
V109,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford Manor what an incredible venue, from initial enquiry to booking, Dodford and the staff were so accommodating and well organised. Nothing was ever too much trouble, even if emails were being sent at 11pm. The day itself, wow it was absolutely incredible, as our wedding was on a budget and due to small numbers Dodford were amazing at setting out our decorations, everything was absolutely perfect and a special shout out to Kayleigh who was amazing on our wedding day. She kept us on time, always checking we were okay and just such a lovely person and really made our day perfect. Would highly recommend a Dodford to any couple due to be married they make the planning and the day an absolute dream and we want to relive it over again."
V109,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"It goes without saying that Dodford is a fab venue.... stunning set up, well maintained, clean, perfect grounds etc... but the best thing about Dodford is the team! I had super high expectations of any wedding venue I booked as I used to run a wedding venue myself (potential nightmare client 😂).... from the 1st viewing the team were fantastic. Relaxed, stress free, organised, professional, knowledgeable, flexible but mostly importantly friendly which gave me complete confidence in them delivering my perfect day.
In the run up to the big day the team are super responsive on email and phone We didn't meet our Event Manager, Lydia, until the day but I was always confident that they work as a whole team and therefore having 1 point of contact was not necessary at all.
In the day Lydia was amazing! Still relaxed and professional and the whole day ran so smoothly. Every requirement was perfect, on time, delivered exceptionally.
We had the best day, thank you to the whole team (especially Lydia!)
Vic & Tony

V109,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We honestly can’t say thank you enough for how amazing Dodford Manor Barn was, along with all the incredible staff who helped make our day truly unforgettable.

From the moment we visited, we fell in love with the beautiful landscapes, open-plan barns, and stunning large windows that flooded the space with natural light. The venue package was one of the best we saw during our search—it felt like everything we could possibly need was covered.

The team at Dodford Manor Barn were incredibly friendly and supportive throughout the entire planning process. Communication was open and consistent, which made everything feel so much more manageable and stress-free. We were even able to find all of our wonderful vendors through Dodford Manor Barn, which was a huge bonus!

As a bride who suffers from anxiety, I was unwell on the morning of the wedding. But I have to give special thanks to Kayleigh and our vendors, who were absolutely amazing and supported me through every step—they helped me feel calm, cared for, and ready to enjoy the day.

Our guests couldn’t stop talking about how stunning the venue was and how lovely the food turned out. We were also lucky enough to have sunshine all day, topped off with a beautiful sunset in the evening—it truly felt magical.

Thank you again, Dodford Manor Barn, for being such a perfect place to start our next chapter.

With love,
Carter & Emmie (24.03.2025) x"
V109,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"From the moment we booked our wedding at Dodford Manor, we knew we were in good hands—but nothing could have prepared us for just how extraordinary the experience would be. Every single detail was handled with such precision, care, and genuine warmth that it truly felt like a dream come to life.

The venue itself is breathtaking, but what made our day unforgettable was the impeccable service. The entire team operated like a well-oiled machine, making sure everything ran smoothly while keeping the atmosphere joyful and stress-free. Their attention to detail was second to none—no request was too big or too small.

We want to give a heartfelt, special shoutout to *Lydia*, our incredible Wedding Manager. From our first meeting to the final dance, she was nothing short of amazing. Lydia went above and beyond at every turn—anticipating needs before we even voiced them, coordinating flawlessly with suppliers, and offering support with a calming confidence that put us completely at ease, (apart from making me cry the second I saw her! 😂). Her passion for what she does shone through in every interaction, and our day would not have been the same without her.

Thanks to this amazing venue and its phenomenal team (especially Lydia!), we were able to truly enjoy every moment of our wedding, knowing everything was in the best possible hands. If you're considering this venue for your big day—don’t hesitate. It’s everything you hope for, and more.

We want to do it over and over!
A day we will NEVER forget!!

Thank you again and all our Love,
Mr & Mr Pargeter-Prince
Rowan & Karl xx"
V109,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We booked Dodford Manor in Feb 2024 after we viewed the space, for our wedding in March 2025. It was the only venue we viewed, but instantly fell in love with the character and variety of spaces the venue had to offer. The free corkage also really appealed to us as a great way for us to bring our own drinks at a good cost.

From start to end, the team were amazing, helping us with the planning of the day and making sure we had a great array of suppliers we could work with. The live band was a huge part of our day, and Dodford have a great mixture of acts on their supplier list.

On the day of the wedding, the groomsmen arrived at the venue to help with set up to see that our amazing event manager, Kayleigh had every single aspect of the day in hand and sorted. She sorted all table settings, decor, stationary - Everything!! Nothing was too much to ask of her and the Dodford team. The day ran impeccably well, with everything being on time and everything we asked for being sorted. Our drinks were served chilled, on time and were always around. It’s easy for venues who offer free corkage to try and limit you drinking your own drink - Not here!! There was constantly beers being topped up, wine bottles replaced and aperol spritz being taken round. Cannot fault them!

The team packed all of our bits away and ready for us to collect the next morning. We are very aware Dodford is a busy venue and wanted to make sure we wasn’t just “another wedding” but at no point was that the case. We felt like we were the one and only wedding and genuinely could not ask for more!

Thank you so so much for everything, Highly recommended!!"
V109,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We got married her a month ago today and had the most amazing day with them. Jess, Jack and the team made sure that everything ran smoothly and that they were doing everything they could for us on the day. We would 100% recommend them for anyone wishing to marry in such a beautiful setting."
V109,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We had been apprehensive booking Dodford for our reception that it was so popular in Northamptonshire that our wedding could end up looking the same as a lot of others we knew of, as we're local - but that was a ridiculous thing to worry about! The level of flexibility/customisation you get with Dodford is unmatched in our opinion; as it's such a beautiful venue to start with, you don't have to work hard to make it look good before adding in your personality as a couple!

The whole process from enquiries to final planning and the execution on the day were great. We did have a slight issue with them not inviting us to a food tasting in enough time before our wedding date (whether they forgot/we were missed off a list we don't know) but when we did raise it they invited us to a tasting at their sister venue instead (it's 2 hours away but we were available to travel thankfully). Every member of staff we encountered in our experience with Dodford were so friendly and make you feel like you are the only couple that matters for them in that moment, which we really appreciated from such a popular/busy venue. Abbie was our Event Manager on the day and provided such an elevated level of service, nothing was too much trouble and she executed our plans/vision to a tee, adding in some extra details that we loved too.

Our wedding was in December 2024, and we only had our reception at Dodford, so the ceremony barn was set up for our drinks reception with plenty of space for guests without it feeling cramped or equally like we were all rattling around in there (we had 75 guests for our reception). They don't have many photos of indoor drinks receptions in their promo so I was a little worried how it would look but the team had it set up beautifully. We also had a brass band on the mezzanine level which was really fun and festive!

What sold Dodford for us was the no daytime corkage, which meant we could really personalise our drinks reception and wedding breakfast drinks without breaking the bank. There was a slight disconnect with how and when we had requested/planned to serve some of the drinks in our planning meeting and what happened on the day, which we think may have been a slight hiccup in communication between Dodford and Jenkinsons (the caterers), but it didn't have a negative impact on our day at all!

Overall, there's a reason this is such a popular venue - it is truly perfect!"
V109,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,Dodford manor is an amazing wedding venue. From the very beginning when we first stepped into the venue to look around we fell in love. We knew we had to have our wedding there. After booking the venue we had amazing contact with the staff from booking our food tasting session. To a general email to see how our wedding planning was going. The planning meeting was well organised and we were able to talk through exactly what we wanted and no want was too big for the team.
V110,Gosfield Hall,"I never imagined my wedding would be somewhere as stunning as Gosfield hall but from the minute we saw this venue we knew it was the one for us and didn't bother viewing anymore venues as we had already made our minds up about having our wedding here! We were absolutely blown away with the natural beauty of Gosfield hall and so booked two years in advance of our wedding day! The professionalism and advice we received from Linda was super helpful and informative on the run up to our wedding as there is soo much to think about! We loved that we could have our day and evening all in one place aswell as the option weather permitting to have our wedding ceremony outside. I'm pleased to say the weather was absolutely perfect on our wedding day and we got to have our fairytale wedding outside! The package we paid for was well worth the money! Our guests were absolutely spoilt on our day and have all said it was the best wedding they've ever been too! It was amazing to have our guests stay over aswell! Jocie our wedding planner was absolutely amazing! She was sooo friendly and super accommodating and went above and beyond on our day to make it absolutely perfect with no hiccups! She even helped dress me on the day as she knew how to do up a corset dress and my mother didn't have a clue lol she made all my wedding details and decorations come to life and done such a stunning job decorating our dream venue aswell as being super supportive towards me my family and guests! The honeymoon suite is the best we've ever seen and completely took ours and our guests breaths away! Mind blowing! The food,venue,grounds,accomodation and night before accomodation were absolutely stunning and we want to thank everyone at Gosfield hall for making our day soo incredible and special and a day we and our guests will never forget! We can't wait to return to Gosfield! Thank you everyone at Gosfield what an amazing place!"
V110,Gosfield Hall,"We had previously experienced Gosfield Hall as a guest before deciding on it for our anniversary.

Our day was beautiful and went according to plan. Our guests all had great feedback about the day.

The only thing we would have changed would have been more diverse menu for the main meals."
V110,Gosfield Hall,"Gosfield hall is a beautiful location for a wedding and their packages cover all the important stuff! We didn’t have to worry about caterers, wedding coordinator or a DJ - all included! Great service, lovely food and everyone really enjoyed the day! Our coordinator Jocie was fab on the day, getting everything organised and fetching anything we needed. Couldn’t have asked for better, she knew the time line and the day flowed really smoothly!"
V110,Gosfield Hall,"We got married at Gosfield Hall and everything about it was perfect from when we arrive to view it, booking, the communication and Faye Carter our wedding Coordinator! If you want the best wedding day with no hassle, Gosfield is your place!!"
V110,Gosfield Hall,"Myself and my Wife have just got married at Gosfield Hall,
Our expensive started when we viewed the venue and we first met Linda sales manager, she welcome us in & made us feel at home, we wasn’t sure how, but she made us feel calm like this was where we was meant to be.
Once we looked around at all the venue has to offer we had already made a decision as this is such a stunning location and instantly new this was what we wanted! It was just right for us.

We did not get made to feel pressured to make any decisions immediately however we did end up booking our big say within the next few days after our visit.

Our next contact was with Ellie our wedding planner, she was very helpful and nothing was ever to much, we enjoyed the food tasting at the venue and was very impressed with the experience, it was out of this world.
Ellie helped us through all of our problems and made sure all of our plans come to life.

Now on our big day, what can I say? The staff were amazing, Ellie couldn’t have done enough every time you wanted to ask a question she was next to us any time we needed something. She was there all the way through the day/ night & even the next morning, Ellie made our day Run seamlessly.
We’ve been to many weddings before but never have we had food as amazing as we did here.
Every guest was amazed at the food quality and commented on how delicious it was!
Just to sum up if you’re thinking about booking your wedding at Gosfield Hall don’t question it just book it. You will be amazed."
V110,Gosfield Hall,"The venue is stunning and was the perfect setting for our winter wedding (so much natural light even in January). Jocie Golbourn was our assigned wedding planning specialist and she is so kind, sweet, patient and professional. All our guests loved the venue but many actually commented on how flawless and seamless the day was organised and rooms decorated and prepared from each section of the wedding and we only have Jocie and venue staff to thank for their meticulous planning and preparations. The food and drinks were delicious. Couldn’t recommend this venue enough- we actually booked the venue on a whim and were SO happy when we visited for an open day. There’s no false advertisements- it’s stunning."
V110,Gosfield Hall,"Everything, from start to finish, was exactly what we wanted and more. The preparation was helped by our wonderful personal manager, Tara, and accommodated each and every one of our requests and needs. The venue is gorgeous, food delicious, and atmosphere felt special. Our friends and family all told us that this was such a spectacular wedding for them that it was the best they've ever been to. We felt completely taken care of, kept us calm and happy throughout the day, and kept all of our suppliers in place and to standard. It felt glamourous and unique. We wish we could relive the day over and over. It really was our dream wedding."
V110,Gosfield Hall,"We got married in Gosfield Hall in May and had the most amazing wedding day that any couple could ask for. The whole experience from the arrival the night before to leaving the day after was seamlessly managed by the team at the venue.
The house and the grounds looked absolutely stunning and Ellie and the team did a brilliant job at keeping the day running smoothly without making anyone feel rushed. Everyone there was immensely friendly and helpful and we really felt that everyone who worked there was invested in making our day feel special.
We fell in love with the venue when we booked it but the whole experience exceeded out expectations so much that we wish we could do it all again!"
V110,Gosfield Hall,"I wanted to take a moment to commend and state our appreciation for Jocie. She truly was phenomenal, approachable and no task was too big.
We had 5 months to plan our wedding and we loved every moment. With us both working in the service industry it was great to have someone who was so switched on and would be an asset to have on any team."
V110,Gosfield Hall,"Having just got married at Gosfield Hall I can honestly say it was the most beautiful venue and the most perfect day. The staff were so attentive and professional. The food was outstanding and the drinks and cocktails were fabulous. They couldn’t do enough to make sure our day was everything we’d dreamt of. I have to say a special thanks to Ellie - one of the wedding coordinators on site - she went above and beyond to help us plan our day and was there from the very moment I woke up delivering fresh pastries for breakfast to the moment she made me a cup of tea to go to bed with. I can’t thank you enough Ellie, you are an absolute credit to Gosfield Hall."
V111,Kingston Estate Totnes,"When I first enquired with Kingston I thought it would be too expensive but we explained what are budget was and when we wanted to get married and they put a quote together that was affordable.
We have just had the most amazing one day wedding which didn't finish until the early hours. We got married in the Long Barn where there are chandeliers running down the middle, it was very romantic. There is this nightclub at Kingston which is very cool which everyone loved. The guests all said the venue was stunning and the food was out of this world.
A few of us stayed the night before and most of our guests stayed the night of the wedding in the cottages and barns. The staff were brilliant and they coordinated the whole day for us. I cant recommend the venue enough."
V111,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had a two day wedding at the Kingston Estate. All our guests were completely blown away by it.
Most of our friends and family had traveled far for the weekend and were not disappointed when then arrived as the cottages and barns are gorgeous. Some even have hot tubs.
Jodie and the Weddings Team organised a welcome party for the first night which was unreal along with providing street style food for everyone around 8.30 pm. At Kingston they have this really cool enormous Yurt and food hut which is used the day before the wedding and for breakfast.
On the wedding day itself we got married in the Walled Garden and there were endless canapes during the drinks reception. We then decided to eat in the Hayloft Barn which has glass windows overlooking all the gardens.
We used the clear span marquee for our reception party and had the craziest cover band before we all went into the nightclub until 3 am. The good thing about Kingston is everything is included they let you use things like cake stands, easels, knifes, speakers, microphones, all furniture at no extra cost, they set everything up for you and then clean up afterwards. We didn]t have to do anything which made everything totally stress free.

Thank you Jodie, Ellie and Charlotte it was insane !!"
V111,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had the most magical wedding at Kingston. From the moment we set foot onto the grounds, we knew it was the perfect place for our special day. It was our first viewing… and nothing else compared for us (we saw a total of 6 venues). What stood out to us the most was the variety of spaces available for each part of the day. The selection of ceremony areas, the beautiful outdoor spots for photos, the yurt for the night before party, and a special one for us… the underground nightclub for the evening! As party lovers, this was a part that sold it for us; there was somewhere for every moment.

One of the things we loved most was the flexibility to personalize every aspect of our wedding. The venue truly felt like a blank canvas that we could transform into our dream setting, but equally, we got away with doing absolutely nothing as it was beautiful all on its own.

But what truly made our experience unforgettable was the incredible staff, led by Jodie. They were not only professional and attentive but also genuinely warm and welcoming. Their support and attention to detail ensured that everything ran smoothly, allowing us to relax and fully enjoy our day.

We're hoping to return and stay in the future, for a special occasion.

It's not just a wedding venue; it's a place that holds a special spot in our hearts as the backdrop to the beginning of our happily ever after 🤍"
V111,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Kingston was perfect. Despite a rainy start, the day was amazing and Jodie was available but subtly in the background allowing the day to be ours."
V111,Kingston Estate Totnes,"After over a two and a half year wait due to Covid, our son and his wife had a wonderful wedding weekend. Jodie from Kingston Estate and her team of staff went above and beyond to ensure the wedding ran smoothly. Every detail was dealt with professionally. The accommodation, venue and food were all excellent and all our guests many from overseas had a wonderful time. The only thing Jodie could not oversee was the weather but even a little rain didn't spoil the celebrations."
V111,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue and staff were brilliant from start to finish. The venue is really multi-functional and caters for rain or shine. The weather was really unpredictable around the time of our wedding but I was a stress free bride knowing they had it in hand. The food supplier was stunning - we had a weekend package which all the guests raved about. That coupled with the unlimited drinks pages made it the perfect venue for us. A Devon treasure that feels like being on a film set - everyone loved it!
V111,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Such a beautiful venue - we loved it so much. The food was incredible and despite having a changeover of wedding planner close to the wedding day, it had no impact on our day what so ever. The venue are calm and professional and loved their approach to communication which was friendly."
V111,Kingston Estate Totnes,Fell in love with the venue on our first visit. We were particularly looking for a venue which could cater us for 3 days and sleep the majority of the the guests. The grounds were well kept especially the walled garden which is where the ceremony took place. The team were a pleasure and made the day truly special.
V111,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Our 3-day wedding celebrations were spent at the STUNNING Kingston Estate - a truly unique venue that we absolutely fell in love with. It had EVERYTHING we were looking for & more. The grounds are perfectly manicured all year round & come complete with walled garden. The cottages & main house are beautifully decorated, providing luxurious accommodation for 86 of our guests. Sarah & the team were such a pleasure to work with & couldn’t do enough for us. The catering was also top notch. Thank you"
V111,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue was great we had a few personal health issues beforehand but the team went above and beyond to make the day extra special. The wedding planner organised everything for us and they had plenty of props on site that we were free to use. We had the whole place to ourselves for the weekend it was brilliant and our friends loved the hot tub and pool.
V112,Holmewood Hall,"We were married at Holmewood Hall on 15th February 2025 and I can honestly say that it was the most magical day. We went to visit the venue and instantly fell in love with it but even we were blown away by how beautiful everything looked on the day. All of the staff were amazing - special shoutout to our personal wedding manager, Laura Pike, who was always on hand to answer any questions - she couldn’t do enough for us! The food was wonderful & we had full control over the menu. Would highly recommend this venue, you won’t regret it!"
V112,Holmewood Hall,"Holmewood Hall was an absolutely perfect wedding venue. The house is stunning, well cared for and beautifully decorated. All of the staff are so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Our Wedding Coordinator was fantastic, available from early morning of the wedding and was still there the morning after working for us. The food was excellent, drinks and canapes were amazing and the venue took care of everything for us. We had the most perfect wedding and are so pleased we chose Holmewood Hall. The Gold Room where we had our ceremony is gorgeous. Thank you for giving us a beautiful wedding!"
V112,Holmewood Hall,"I cannot fault this venue at all, the venue itself is breathtakingly beautiful with magnificent rooms and very lovingly maintained grounds. The staff are incredibly friendly, professional and efficient, our wedding coordinator Lee was a pleasure to work with and made our special day run smoothly. If you want a hassle free wedding with breathtaking grounds and the most amazing staff then this is the venue for you."
V112,Holmewood Hall,"Had the most amazing wedding here recently and cannot recommend it enough.

The venue itself is stunning and the options included in the luxe package covered everything we could've possibly wanted and made planning the wedding 100x less stressful.

The staff were all amazing from start to finish, Katie showed us around initially and then Lee was our personal wedding manager, and they were both incredible throughout. Always on hand to answer any questions and help us through the day once we got there.
We had so many comments from our guests on how lovely the staff were on the day!

A particular highlight though was the food - the tasting evening was a dream and the chef went above and beyond to provide a full vegan menu for us which wasn't limited to only a couple of options.
Again, we had so many non-vegan guests complimenting the food and saying how lovely it was!

Overall, an incredible day and an incredible venue.
Thank you so much to everyone there!"
V112,Holmewood Hall,"This place is simply just amazing 🤩
We had our wedding here on 17-12-24 and it was everything we dreamed of and more. The food, staff, decor were just perfect not forgetting the most beautiful Christmas tree 😍
Our person wedding planner Lee was an absolute god send not just having him there on the day but always being at the end of a phone to answer any questions or worry’s.
If we could go back and do it all again we would and not change a single thing.
The most perfect day at the most perfect venue ♥️"
V112,Holmewood Hall,Perfect venue for a wedding with guest numbers 60 - 100. Our guests and I moved from each room to a new room throughout the day and every room had a new surprise. The bridal suite was lush and it was great having all our guests staying under one roof. I would 100% recommend this to anyone.
V112,Holmewood Hall,"The wedding day and lead up to the day were fab. However, for the price we paid, we expected a little bit more.
I opted to use the bridal cottage the evening before for which we paid £450 extra. This is something I now regret, as there was no hot water and we were not able to order any food in as all the take away options were shut (on a Friday night). The hot tub also needed a good clean. So the night before/morning of my wedding was not ideal. I flagged this to the manager who advised that we should have raised the cold water issue as soon as possible, but seeing as we were trying to have morning showers on the wedding day, this did not leave us any time.
Our package included pre-drinks, wine with dinner and we also purchased a cocktail ""cart"" (cocktails on a table) and a bucket of beers. The groom, who is not a wine fan, asked for a beer with his wedding meal and was presented with a contactless card machine to pay for it at the top table. We felt this was a bit unnecessary as there was a full bucket of extra beers outside and it felt a little embarrassing having a card machine presented to us at the top table on our wedding day for one measly Corona, despite the huge amount we had paid. Also, guests were unknowingly allowed to buy beers from the bar after the meal, despite there being available beers to them already in a bucket next to the bar...
Overall the wedding was lovely, but for the price we paid we expected a bit better. Essentially, I loved the venue, but I wish we had not purchased any extras!"
V112,Holmewood Hall,"We got married at Holmewood Hall on 4th October 2024. From the first moment we stepped into the venue and I saw the magnificent Gold room I knew this would be the perfect place for us to get married. We had the most amazing day which was perfectly coordinated by the whole team at Holmewood but especially so by our personal wedding manager Lee. Lee was always quick to respond to any questions we had in the lead up to the day and nothing was too much trouble for him.
We honestly wish we could do it all over again as it was a magical day. We would recommend Holmewood Hall to anyone looking for the perfect venue."
V112,Holmewood Hall,"After getting engaged in late March this year we wanted to get married fairly quickly so booked Holmewood for the same September. The venue, grounds, accomodation were all stunning and we felt very fortunate it was within budget and the package we got was outstanding in comparison to other venues and what it included, which was far far more than other venues. We got to attend a luxe event to choose all our wedding food, canapés, cocktails and wines which should have made things easier but due to the unbelievable quality it made it harder! Our wedding planner Lee is literally the most fantastic person. He was flexible, fun, engaged and on absolutely everything. The day was ran impeccably and also smooth even with some weather concerns and speeches taking a bit longe than we thought. If you book here ask for Lee!! We had the most perfect day. Can’t fault a single things. Our guests all told us how incredible everything was with one even saying he will now longer not attend any further weddings unless it’s at Holmewood. Thank you to all the staff and as mentioned a huge special thank you to Lee! Your a legend!"
V112,Holmewood Hall,"Exceptional venue, stunning grounds, fantastic DJ, and excellent service. Highly recommended! Happiest day of my life 😊"
V113,Bourton Hall,"We got married at Bourton Hall on 08 March 2025 and our wedding planner was Harminder. The day was absolutely amazing from start to finish. All the food and drinks were of a high standard and presented beautifully which includes the wedding breakfast, canapés and cocktails, and breakfast the next day. The venue is gorgeous with lots of rooms, well maintained grounds and exclusive use. The staff are friendly and accommodating and the event was really well managed. We would like to particularly thank Harminder, who was supportive throughout the wedding planning process and the wedding day, ensuring things ran smoothly and in a timely manner. He is a great communicator, provided advice and guidance where needed and attention to detail. We really had a magical day! Thank you so much! We would happily do it all over again and would definitely recommend this venue!"
V113,Bourton Hall,"What a fabulous wedding venue! Because it's a wedding venue and not a hotel that holds the occasional wedding, they really focused on what was important and anticipated our every need. It's an elegant venue but with a comfortable feel to it. The team are incredibly accommodating and helpful and each couple is allocated their own personal wedding manager to guide them through the process and to make sure every detail is covered.
There's a beautiful chapel on site where non-religious ceremonies can be held - this was fabulous.
The food was plentiful and delicious - all our guests raved about it. Great choice of welcome drinks and canapes, wines and cocktails.
The grounds are gorgeous; a perfect backdrop for our October wedding.
The venue was exclusively ours and has beautiful bedrooms, including a huge, stunning bridal suite. Most of our guests stayed overnight and took advantage of the brilliant breakfast in the morning so it really extended the celebration."
V113,Bourton Hall,"Our wedding at Bourton Hall was better than we ever imagined. The Italianate mansion is truly spectacular inside and out however it is the team that made our day run perfectly. Our guests found the setting and the food incredible, they were very impressed! Our wedding planner Emily Sarjant was fantastic her knowledge and expertise made our day magical from start to finish, with all the special touches that she suggested. Our first dance was created in such a beautiful way it will be a memory we cherish forever. Thank you to Emily and the team at Bourton Hall. My husband would also like to note that the croquembouche was amazing and everyone should have one."
V113,Bourton Hall,"My wife and I got married at Bourton Hall in September, with our wedding managed by the wonderful Eleni. Everything about the day went as perfectly as we could've wished, right from arrival to departure the following day. The venue is stunning, and the food was lovely, and having 21 bedrooms on site was such a bonus so that all of our close friends and family could stay on site with us.
Bourton Hall did everything they could both in the run up to the day and on the day itself to alleviate all stress to ensure everything ran as seamlessly as possible, which it absolutely did.
We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall enough."
V113,Bourton Hall,"We were married on 28th July 2024. What an amazing day we had at Bourton Hall. Could not fault it! The venue is so elegant! The grounds and views were to die for. The food was out of this world with so many choices and all cooked and served to perfection. Accommodation / rooms were plentiful and luxurious. Lovely to have a chapel on site too. We had the whole place to ourselves, we felt like royalty! Lots of varied rooms and areas for people to choose where they wanted to be after the wedding breakfast. We would choose the venue all over again!"
V113,Bourton Hall,"We had both our wedding ceremony and reception at Bourton Hall and the service was superb throughout. The house and grounds are beautiful with amazing views to go with them. The staff were professional and helpful during the lead up to our wedding day and during the day as well - even when we had an emergency prior to the ceremony which caused delays, the venue staff were able to work around this to move timings back in order to allow all of our planned activities to go ahead and be fully enjoyed. All the food was delicious and we had a wonderful wedding day thanks to Bourton Hall."
V113,Bourton Hall,"We had the most perfect wedding day at Bourton Hall. Throughout the planning process and on the day, the team were so professional, which meant we could relax and know that everything was in their capable hands - Emily was an amazing wedding manager. The building is beautiful inside and out, and the grounds are stunning - there are so many places for beautiful photos, and views out over the countryside. The food was absolutely delicious, it was so hard to choose what to have! It was also so helpful to have so many places for guests to sit and chat in the evening, away from the disco room but still part of the action. Having so many bedrooms onsite (not to mention a stunning bridal suite!) was an added bonus. We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall highly enough, and have had so many comments from guests saying what a beautiful, elegant but relaxed day it was, so I know they really appreciated everything Bourton has to offer too. Thank you so much to Emily and the whole team for giving us such a perfect day!"
V113,Bourton Hall,"As the Bride and Groom we were made to feel like nothing was too much to ask and they couldn't do enough to make us feel special.
All the guests commented that it was one of the prettiest and most relaxed weddings they have been to.
We could not have asked for a better wedding day thanks to Bourton!"
V113,Bourton Hall,"I had my wedding on 10/02/2024 I am so happy I chose this venue, It is really magical. My wedding manager was just the best! Emily went above and beyond to help me on my big day! I cannot thank her enough.

One of the main things about this venue is that t has its own chappel which is really special and makes you wedding seem more traditional, however there are more options/ rooms available. I wanted the wow factor and I got it.

Some of the options that made it great

*Onsite accommodation for night before and night of the wedding is really helpful
*Exclusive use
*Dedicated wedding manager definate gamechanger! (Emily)
*Menu choices are fantastic.

Everyone commented on the food being really nice ( we had the lamb) The evening buffet was also great. I paid extra to have a meal created as having part of my culture within the food at the wedding was very important to me, they did not disappoint.
Emily was perfect in so many ways, she knew exactly my vision once i explained it to her and she made sure that it became real for me. She adapted parts of the day so that it would work better, for example bringing the canapes outside whilst photos where being taken. Helping me into my dress, looking after my phone just everything I needed she was there. She really worked hard to make sure it run perfectly and it did.

Thank you emily!!! You made my day Great."
V113,Bourton Hall,We got married at Bourton Hall on 30th July 2023. It was the most amazing day ever! We are still receiving compliments from our guests on how stunning the venue was and the whole running of the day. This was 100% down to our wedding co-ordinator Harminder. He went above and beyond to ensure our day was absolutely perfect. He literally could not have done any more! Thank you again Harminder!!
V114,B&H Buildings,Bourne & Hollingsworth was such an exceptional venue for our wedding this September. This is the perfect place for you if you want a true London wedding that feels like a fun dinner/house party but on an epic scale. We used the top floor (the studios) for our sit down dinner (think candle light and tasty roast lamb) and headed downstairs for our reception with the basement club (below and hidden) for late night dancing. The place is stunning (greenery and glass everywhere and the cocktails are insane but what really makes this place are the people. The whole staff from Matt and Lizzie to the bar team to the dinner crew made our whole day seamless and so fun. Could not recommend B&H more highly for your London wedding.
V114,B&H Buildings,"Beautiful wedding celebration in the most stylish venue - we had an intimate wedding reception (drinks, dinner and more drinks!) at the Bourne & Hollingsworth Buildings. The staff members on duty were excellent - nothing was too much trouble and they served everyone with such professionalism. We couldn’t recommend it highly enough and we haven’t stopped talking about it since. All of our guests were so impressed with the space and how stylish it was. The bar, restaurant and greenhouse are all aesthetically beautiful and the botanical vibes make for a very relaxed, but premium setting. Special shout out to Lizzie who helped us coordinate everything and Matt on the day who led the team. Thank you so much - we had the best day and we couldn’t have wished to host it in a better venue."
V114,B&H Buildings,"India & the B&H team were seamless. Flexible, responsive, kind, and easy to deal with. They made our day so special. The food was fantastic, the drinks were lovely, and the value for money was first rate!"
V115,Leez Priory,"I never in my life thought I would get married in a place like Leez priory! The whole experience from start to finish was just fantastic. The price breakdown was manageable and there was no pressure to take any upgrades offered. The things we got in our package were phenomenal and having a wedding planner was tremendous - our lady (Leanne) was an absolute god send!
They catered to all our needs and we were made to feel so comfortable and nothing was a problem! I’d highly suggest going to an event there before hand, just to get a feel of what it’s like full of people and enjoy their delicious food. We actually enjoyed their entertainer ( singer) so much we hired him for our wedding ☺️
Lee priory is just so beautiful. I can’t speak highly enough x"
V115,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory on the 7th of September 2024. Considering how long they have been a wedding venue, they were pretty flexible with some of the ideas we had for the venue styling that turned out amazingly!

The staff really made the day something special and couldn't have done enough for us. Special mention must be made for Leanne, our wedding planner, who was amazing!

Highly recommend the venue and the incredible team that helped to make our day so special!"
V115,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in October 2024. This venue is stunning both inside and out with immaculately kept grounds and interior. The hospitality in the lead up to and on the day of the wedding was fantastic. The food was also brilliant. Another great perk of this venue is the amount of on site accommodation.

A couple of drawbacks / experiences during our wedding. There are only a few toilets in the main building which kept blocking and overflowing throughout the evening which led to us taking some guests to the dressing room or honeymoon cottage to use the facilities. You are also restricted by the venue on any external food or drink suppliers and the venues optional extras for this are quite expensive for what they are.

That asaide, we had the best day and evening at Leez Priory and would certainly recommend it!"
V115,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in August 2024- great venue and experience from initial viewing to leaving the morning after the wedding. Leanne acted as our wedding planner and was friendly, professional and helpful throughout. We opted for the classic package and the food was amazing quality with everyone commenting how full they were!
The venue is beautiful with several options for ceremony both inside and out. Accommodation was great too. The whole day ran smoothly with perfect weather - we will have very happy memories of our day!"
V115,Leez Priory,"Perfect venue and very attentive staff, lovely food and great communication from start to finish"
V115,Leez Priory,"Stunning venue. Fantastic Team. Very accommodating toward our unique ""surprise"" strategy. Our guests were truly surprised. Thank you."
V115,Leez Priory,"Leez priory was the 1st and only venue we looked around when we started planning our wedding. From the moment we stepped on the premises, everything just looked so perfect and exactly what we wanted from a wedding venue. When we got assigned our wedding co-ordinator Rachel, she was just absolutely spot on with everything we asked for and nothing was too big an ask for her. She made sure the day ran as smoothly as possible and took care of any issue that arose without me knowing (which I am forever grateful for!!)
The rest of the staff were amazing and very helpful.

The venue itself is just absolutely stunning and we loved that it has the pub area as well as the dance floor so it catered to all of our guests.

All of the rooms were lovely and it was so nice being able to stay in the fisherman’s lodge onsite the night before the wedding.

We genuinely cannot recommend this venue enough and it was 100% worth the money! 10/10!"
V115,Leez Priory,"We got married on a Tuesday in October to maximise the value of what we could get for our money; and honestly, we got everything we wanted and more. Leanne, our Wedding Manager was perfect at bringing an attention to detail and seamless organisation to the big day, and in the lead up. There wasn't one moment of the day where we felt stressed, as Leanne had it covered. In one particular instance, our flowers for the bridal party's hair hadn't arrived. Within five minutes of telling Leanne that we needed this, the flowers were with our hair and make-up suppliers to add the finishing touches.

Leez Priory as a venue is the most stunning setting, and offers an incredible range of areas in which the ceremony and reception can take place. There is also the opportunity for the bridal party to make use of the Fisherman's Cottage the night before the wedding, and for people to stay in the on-site accommodation on the evening of the wedding, making it the perfect venue for people also travelling from further afield.

Leez Priory were very accommodating, welcoming and were happy to work with us to make our day as perfect as possible. The food was incredible, and a total hit with all of our guests, and so many people have commented on how incredible the day was as a whole. You wouldn't be disappointed to choose Leez Priory."
V115,Leez Priory,They catered to our every need. To when we would ask for things they hadn’t been done before they still made sure it went smoothly. Leanne was amazing she made me feel so comfortable from the start. The whole day was stunning. Beautiful venue please go view it as you will not be disappointed
V115,Leez Priory,We got married on the 26 May 2024. This venue was absolutely brilliant! They catered for every need and made sure there was no stress on the day. Leanne was kind and level headed throughout and was always one step ahead! Do not hesitate to book- do it now!
V116,London Rowing Club,"We picked this place because we wanted somewhere fairly central and casual. We fell in love with the long room and the view. Our wedding was in October so we thought we'd have it cosy but we ended up with a beautiful autumnal day so everyone was on the balcony. The fairy lights were perfect and the other rooms were great to avoid leaving. The staff was so friendly and accommodating that we would definitely recommend the venue.

The only thing that could have tainted the day is that after three visits and many emails, we were never told that the river floods (a lot). We were flexible with our day so if we knew this we would have built it into our day, instead, I was told by the photographer on the day as I got out of the taxi that we wouldn't be able to take any group photos because the area would be flooded during the cocktail hour and half that we had assigned as photo time. This would have been disappointing but we all ended up running outside after the ceremony to take photos before the tide came in. My husband and I borrowed wellies for our couple photos. We had fun doing this, but I can imagine many couples being upset! My friend's electric car also flooded and they were obviously upset."
V116,London Rowing Club,"Annabel was meticulous in her help planning the wedding. Very knowledgeable and helpful.
On the day the rest of the staff were brilliant - there wasn’t an empty glass in the house.
Great venue at a reasonable price on the London riverside."
V116,London Rowing Club,"LRC was the perfect place to celebrate our wedding this summer. The venue staff went above and beyond to ensure that everything went as planned both before and during the event. Thanks in particular to Annabel who was responsive, helpful and always put us at ease in the build up. The location is stunning - couldn’t have asked for a better day!"
V116,London Rowing Club,"We just wanted to say an enormous thank you for everything. From the moment we came to visit the LRC on a slightly grey January weekend, we knew it would be a fabulous venue for our June wedding reception and it certainly did not disappoint. It really is the most beautiful setting and we have very fond memories of our guests enjoying drinks in the sunshine with the most fantastic view over the Thames. The venue has such character and lends itself beautifully to a wedding reception. We have received so many compliments from our guests and I would encourage anyone thinking about booking their wedding at the LRC to do it, you will not regret it! We were lucky to be blessed with beautiful weather so were able to have our jazz musicians play on the balcony for the drinks reception before moving into the Long Room for our meal. It looked stunning with the tables dressed and mantles adorned with flowers. Following the meal and speeches, guests enjoyed drinks back on the balcony and in the Fairburn and Members Rooms which provide plenty of seating, whilst the Long Room was cleared and the band set up. We then partied the night away.

From start to finish, the organisation was so straight forward. Annabel was very accommodating and full of helpful advice in the run up. I knew that on the day she would ensure things ran like clock work, which of course they did. Our suppliers also commented on how helpful the LRC team were to work with. On the day the staff were brilliant and went out of their way to ensure everything ran smoothly (including borrowing some large gym fans from the rowers to put in the Long Room to keep us cool as it was an unexpectedly hot day). We really can’t thank you enough and now need to think of an excuse to host another party with you in the future!"
V116,London Rowing Club,"We got married in St. Mary's church and then had our reception in the London Rowing Club in February 2023. It far exceeded our expectations and was an incredible fabulous stress-free day with thanks to the wonderful Annabel making the day just run.

In the lead up to the event, Annabel was incredibly responsive, helpful and helped us plan the day exactly how we wanted it. She answered all our questions really quickly, always got back to us, was very flexible with what we could do and allowing us to personalise the space. Prior to the event, Annabel arranged for us to go and have a look around on a couple of additional occasions to help us plan how we would want it to look. She also gave our caterers a tour of the kitchens as they were new to the venue.

In the immediate lead up to the day, Annabel helped with our suppliers in getting chairs delivered and bringing all the wine over a day earlier. On the day, she helped to make the day flow and just dealt with things throughout the day.

The venue itself is beautiful with three rooms to use. A middle reception room, a cosy snug and the main long room. In the main long room, there is a rowing boat hanging upside down with fairly lights. The main lighting can be dimmed and gave a wonderful atmosphere for the evening meal. As our wedding was a winter wedding, it was fairly chilly so they lit fires in the main room and snug which added to the atmosphere.

We had around 90 guests - could have fitted a few more just about. We used the round tables, tablecloths, linen, plates cutlery and glasses provided and they were perfect for a wedding and looked very smart. No need to hire these. As mentioned, we did hire separate wedding chairs instead of the conference chairs provided. There's a lot of decoration in the way of rowing memorabilia on the walls which means you don't have to actually do too much to make it interesting for guests.

Overall, the perfect London wedding venue with absolutely fabulous views across the Thames with a long balcony to enjoy from. To top it off Annabel is truly amazing and so helpful."
V116,London Rowing Club,"We had our wedding (ceremony+reception) at LRC in July, and the venue itself and the team we worked with were absolutely incredible! Everything on the day went without a hitch and we heard so many compliments on the location - our guests loved the balcony and the layout inside, which included plenty of space for anyone wanting a break from dancing to sit down and relax. Would recommend to anyone looking to host an event!"
V116,London Rowing Club,"London Rowing Club is a truly fantastic venue and we were both so delighted with how our day went! The venue has real character with the classic rowing memorabilia and it’s location on the Thames, and looks amazing when it’s all set up. The layout and size of rooms I thought were perfect for our wedding of about 70 (+15ish more in the evenings) and of course the big attraction is the balcony which all of our guests adored!! (I wish I’d had more time during the day to stand out there and enjoy it 😂). Not only is it a fantastic venue in a great location but what really made this the most amazing venue was how great all of the staff, and all the recommend suppliers were! The day exceeded expectations and we got compliments on the place and the staff from all our guests. Couldn’t be happier with the venue, it was perfect for us!!"
V116,London Rowing Club,"We found the London Rowing Club while desperately combing through London locations after our original venue fell through a few months before the day.
Luckily for us it was available due to a cancellation - kismet!
From the start the charming Annabel put us very much at ease and helped us to envisage the day as we hoped it would be. She was very flexible and helpful throughout the planning process.
We were incredibly lucky with the weather on the day and the venue really came into its own - it was virtually impossible to get guests off the terrace, which is the perfect size for our smallish event (65 people) and of course offers gorgeous river views.
We were well looked after by the team and everything went off without a hitch. The interior of the space itself is lovely with a great sense of history.
Nice additional touch - table tennis was made available in the entry room for the later part of the evening!

It's a special place and I'd thoroughly recommend for anyone seeking a memorable spot to tie the knot!"
V116,London Rowing Club,"We got married at the London Rowing Club on a brilliantly sunny winter day on Saturday. All the way through in the run up (after 2 years or more of postponements), Annabel and team bent over backwards to help us arrange everything, recommended some brilliant suppliers for food (Shona Pollock comes highly recommended) and flowers (same with Steph the charityflorist.)

So many of our guests said how lovely the venue and staff were on the day, and the whole place looked a million dollars with an amazing photo set on and around the balcony and river - although we haven't seen those yet. The corkage and bar tariff prices are also incredibly reasonable for an inner London location!

I can't recommend the LRC highly enough. It will live in memory for a very long time."
V116,London Rowing Club,"The London Rowing Club team alongside the Dinner Ladies went above and beyond to ensure that we had the wedding perfectly fitting our requirements. Throughout the entire all of the suppliers worked seamlessly together to ensure the space transformed as we progressively added guests and transitioned between eating, our ceremony, more eating, music and dancing. We wouldn’t have had it any other way. The attention to detail of the team is second to none - perfect for any bride and groom seeking a beautiful event."
V117,The Prince Albert,"The team at The Prince Albert were always accommodating, made everything easy and stress-free, and helped us organise an amazing wedding party. They really knew what they were doing, and helped guide us through the process calmly, working around our schedule (which wasn't easy - we live abroad!) to make sure all our last-minute worries and concerns were sorted smoothly. The food was excellent, and the space was fantastic for our party. Can't recommend it highly enough!"
V117,The Prince Albert,"We had such a happy wedding with Harrison and this venue. Harrison was really flexible and answered any questions we had and made great suggestions when we needed seating arrangements, the schedule for the day, a florist, and more. The day was accessible to everyone and the food and drink were perfect. Thank you for making out wedding stress free and wonderful."
V117,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert was the most wonderful venue for our London wedding. We came across the venue at there wedding fair and chose alot of our suppliers from the same wedding fair.

Harrison and Lauren were always so on hand to help with any questions and did a fantastic job answering all of our questions. The staff were so friendly and helpful and made everything run like clockwork.

We couldn’t recommend The Prince Albert enough for a london wedding and would love to do it all again."
V117,The Prince Albert,"My wife and I were beyond happy with how everything went on our wedding day. Harrison, Diana, Claudio and the whole team were absolutely phenomenal! It was such a beautifully efficient operation, and we always felt like someone was there to help us when needed.

We've had dozens of compliments about the great food and how wonderfully intimate the venue was for a wedding. Some of our more traditional relatives said they were initially sceptical at the prospect of a pub wedding, but that it was one of the most beautiful and joyful weddings they’d been to. A friend of mine was also very happy that someone at the bar remembered her drink order throughout the evening! On top of that, everything ran perfectly to schedule, which is no doubt down to the high attention to detail.

It was very useful that the upstairs was free on Friday afternoon so that we could set up the space. It gave us plenty of time to do the flower arrangements, put up the bunting, and stick photos on the frame wall.

Thank you again so much for all the help and support you've given us - it really was the best day of our lives (so far)!"
V117,The Prince Albert,"My husband and I got married here in late September 2023, and I cannot recommend the Prince Albert enough!! Booking a wedding venue can be stressful and we felt like a lot of the venues we looked at gave us the ""hard sell"" but the folks at the Prince Albert helped to put us at ease every step of the way. We fell in love with how beautiful the pub was, so hired the upstairs for the ceremony, wedding breakfast and party afterwards for around 40 - 45 people. We were able to drop off decorations the night before and talk it all through with the staff, and they did such a good job of working with us and the florist to get the place looking amazing. The ceremony went off without a hitch, everybody loved the food and we had a blast in the evening. All the staff were amazing, but special shout out to Harrison and Lauren for helping us plan and run the day, and Maria for managing everything on the ground both when we dropped off the decorations and during the wedding itself. Thank you again for helping us celebrate our special day with our loved ones, for making it so stress free and so memorable!"
V117,The Prince Albert,"All you ever hear about wedding venues is that everything is a rip off, the food is meh, and there are a ton of annoying restrictions...the opposite is true of Harrison and The Prince Albert team. From Day 1, Harrison made the whole process not only easy but really fun! He was quick to respond, super knowledgeable, and very accommodating; he even helped our best man execute a surprise for us without it disrupting any timings. On the day, they decorated the place beautifully, managed to serve a 3 course dinner to 76 people unbelievably fast, and everyone raved about the food - to say they did a good job is a gross understatement, they went above and beyond. We were after ""classy fun"" and that's exactly what we got - thank you so so much!"
V117,The Prince Albert,"We had the exact wedding reception we wanted at the Prince Albert thanks to Harrison, Claudio and the other amazing staff who helped us feel so relaxed in the build up and during. We wanted a very low-key vibe and the team understood that but there were enough options for any style of wedding you wanted. The upstairs function room felt cozy and intimate while still leaving breathing room and space to dance, but you could easily rent the whole place if you wanted more guests and even choose to do your ceremony there. We had the most compliments on our food (we chose a buffet option). The team were particularly accomodating to some complicated dietary requirements and it was all delicious."
V117,The Prince Albert,"July 6, 2023 was the most memorable day of our lives! A big thank you to Harrison and the rest of the team for assisting us through out the whole process. Our guests loved the Prince Albert pub especially the sumptuous food and booze on our wedding day!

David & Dannah"
V117,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert is a Great venue for the classic Pub Wedding.
Harrison and the team did an amazing job to organize everything. The food was great and the service first class. Only sorry it was over so quickly. Thanks again for everything."
V117,The Prince Albert,"We found The Prince Albert when our original venue cancelled on us less than 2 months before our wedding. & we are so glad we did; everything happens for a reason! From the moment we met Harrison, we knew we were in safe hands, and the team at the Prince Albert made our day amazing. The pub looked beautiful and we were very greatful for the effort the team put in putting up all our decorations. We had so many compliments about the food, and we were very impressed in the swift and organised manner in whichever it was served. Everyone had a wonderful time, and we would not hesitate in recommending The Prince Albert."
V118,Kindred,"We chose Kindred for our 60 person wedding and it could not have been better. We wanted a venue where we could have the ceremony, dinner and dancing all under one roof, that was wheelchair accessible, and easy to get to on the tube, Kindred ticks all those boxes and more!
The food is incredible, we really enjoyed popping by to do all the tastings, we'll continue to come to the Cellar for food and cocktails. Many guests commented on how good the food was.
The place itself is gorgeous, inside and out. We used the whole venue, the main Hall for the ceremony, dinner and dancing, and the Library upstairs for the drinks reception and cake cutting. Also, being right next to Hammersmith station, the venue could not be easier to get to!
The staff are wonderfully attentive and helpful, both before and on the day. They were really open to the little details that made our day uniquely ours, from the drinks selections, to having a table and glasses on stage for the ceremony, to playing our music selections at the right time. Plus its a dog friendly venue!"
V118,Kindred,"We LOVE this venue! We got married here with only 12 weeks notice and Anna, the owner, and her staff went above and beyond to make the day as memorable, magical, and marvellous as we'd hoped it would be. The venue is elegant, stylish and perfect for a London, city based wedding. The food is sensational as it comes from their in-house kitchen on the ground floor and every guest remarked on how delicious their meal was. It's restaurant quality food, not your standard wedding food. The place looks stunning in all our wedding photos and the wedding cake they made us (at very short notice I might add!) was second to none. Everyone loved it. The venue was also perfect for late night dancing and drinking and merriment. It was such a pleasure - and a breeze - to work with Anna and her team on one of the most important days of my life, and I very much hope to do so again in the future. I will forever be grateful to her and all she helped us with."
V118,Kindred,"We had our wedding reception for 35 guests at Kindred, in the Library and Salon earlier this year. The day went incredibly smoothly, the staff couldn't have been more attentive and our guests raved about the food for weeks afterwards. It was the perfect sized space for our intimate celebration, really cosy and the atmosphere was great. The little touches really helped to make the day special, with espresso martinis served for the speeches and sparklers for our exit at the end of the night. Thanks again to the lovely Kindred team!"
V118,Kindred,"I cannot find a single fault in our experience with Kindred for our wedding. Not only was it a stunning venue that honestly made some of our guests gasp as they arrived, but Anna and the team were so incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. Having them support us really took so much of the wedding planning stress away and we knew we were in safe hands. I really appreciated that the team were happy to chat through ideas with me and were always keen to find creative solutions to give us the day that we had envisioned.

The food was absolutely delicious and they were so accommodating for our long list of dietary requirements from our guest. The cocktails were also so delicious. Our guests were buzzing for weeks after, as were we.

On the night, the staff were not only incredibly helpful and efficient, but also just so friendly, welcoming and complimentary. We felt thoroughly spoilt and very well looked after.

We visited so many venues and this was by far the best choice for us. The interiors made for some stunning photos and the layout of the spacing meant that whilst we had 80-100 guests, it still felt very intimate. I cannot recommend Kindred enough!"
V118,Kindred,"We would give a thousand stars if we could. Kindred hosted us for our cocktail style wedding and it was everything we could have hoped for and the perfect venue for this style of wedding. The wine, cocktails and food (incredible grazing board, canapés, bowls and pizzas) were exceptional and the team were on top of everything, friendly and nothing was ever an issue. We would HIGHLY recommend it. We have had loads of guests message us to tell us what a spectacular venue it was with the most friendly team. The venue had different spaces to suit our needs and the AV is amazing - it worked perfectly for our live music band and our DJ, and our own music playlists for our ceremony. They took the stress off planning and really did mean we could relax and not worry that everything would run smoothly. Thank you so much Kindred team for giving us the best day of our lives"
V119,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The best day of our lives and me and my now husband couldn't be more thankful to Bredenbury. Before booking Bredenbury we visited over 17 wedding venues in Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Herefordshire - we fell in love instantly, there is no need for a crazy amount of extra expense on decorations, the venue speaks for itself. The fact that it was no corkage just added to why we wanted to book and the team were so friendly. In the lead up to the wedding they were brilliant, we booked far in advance and brought over all our family members to come see the venue, they were so flexible, understanding and welcoming - they couldn't do enough for us. On the wedding day they had decorated for us by the time we had arrived and all we had to do on the day was to enjoy it - which was perfect. It really was the best day of our lives, all the comments from our family and friends was how beautiful the venue was. They kept the day running so smooth and we didn't need to think about a thing."
V119,Bredenbury Court Barns,"There truly aren't words to describe how incredible Bredenbury Court Barns and their entire team of fantastic staff were through the planning process and the day itself. They were so friendly, supportive and nothing was ever too much. From quick replies to any questions that popped to mind to planning meetings that left us feeling prepared and ready to the day being set up beyond perfectly. Our amazing wedding coordinator Lianna spent the days and months (years really!) leading up to our big day making sure everyone detail was perfect, that everything was incorporated that we'd dreamed of and made sure we didn't feel a moment of stress from start to finish. All throughout the building from the bridal booth, to the orangery to the oak barn was beautifully light and open - even with our wedding being the end of October - and we had so many compliments about this! There aren't enough words to say thank you and explain just how much we'd recommend this venue to everyone"
V119,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We had the perfect day back in July. The weather didn't go to plan but they helped make the day so special even with the last minute switches because of the rain. We had such an amazing day and the feedback from our guests about the venue, food and service was great! We cannot thank the team enough for the effort they put in throughout the whole process but especially on the day. We felt incredibly supported throughout the whole process."
V119,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The venue itself is stunning. The buildings, grounds and interior decorations are all beautiful and immaculately presented. From the moment you turn down the lane it is so picturesque, you know you've found somewhere special. It's exactly what we were imagining for our wedding venue.

The layout is perfect, with ample space for guests to mingle and move about, and great accessibility for older and disabled guests. Ours was a winter wedding, and while most of the day was inside it wasn't cramped and we could still enjoy the beautiful grounds through the expansive windows that run along the whole barn.

All of the venue is stunning, but practicality-wise the Bridal Suite warrants a special mention. Room length mirrors, plenty of room for the bridal party to get ready, have their makeup and hair done, and if there's time to relax as well. Drinks were served from 11 onwards, and it has it's own toilets and shower.

From our first meeting at Bredenbury the staff were exceptional. They gave a reassuring air of professionalism and experience, with just the right level of excitedness for our day without it feeling forced. We were really impressed by how responsive the whole team were, with speedy replies to any questions we had during the planning. This is something we particularly appreciated as we only gave ourselves 7 weeks to plan our big day.

Value for money wise it felt tricky to gauge when we were trying to choose a venue as the headline figure is rarely what you'll end up paying, with different venues charging different amounts for different things. Not the case with Bredenbury. With their No Corkage policy and generosity in being able to use whatever props they already have, any extras were non-essentials of our own choosing.

No Corkage is pretty significant. Some venues wanted to charge £20/bottle, so not having to pay this and being able to supply not only our own wine but beers, gin and soft drinks for the drinks reception and wedding breakfast was not only a massive saving but also made the occasion more personal for us. The bar staff and catering team were excellent, pouring and serving drinks, warming our mulled wine and setting up the gin bar. Once your guests have drunk you dry the venue's bar is well stocked and standard pub pricing.

We wanted a Christmas wedding and seeing in early November that they had a date available that December we couldn't resist. 7 weeks isn't long to organise a wedding with nearly 100 guests, and we couldn't have done it without the Bredenbury team being so organised. Our assigned event manager, Harriet, was brilliant in the runup and on the day, as were all the other managers and staff we spoke with. The Wedding Bible they fill out with you is a great idea and nails down all the finer details to ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible on the day.

We didn't want to have to spend the day before and morning of our wedding worrying about set up and decorations, but needn't have worried as Bredenbury did all of this for us. A meeting beforehand clarified what we wanted where; we simply dropped off boxes of stuff the day before and rocked up in the morning to find everything laid out as hoped.

This organisation extended to the third party suppliers, of which Bredenbury have an extensive list of local recommendations. We booked the ceiling lights with Cotswold Wedding Co. and didn't have to do anything else. The band, Apollo Gold (incredible!!) set up without any hassle and didn't have any issues with Bredenbury's noise limiter. Our florist Katrina Bevis hadn't been there before, but again had no problem getting everything in place on the morning.

On-site accommodation was good for close family and friends, but there's not enough for the majority of guests and the lack of a dedicated honeymoon suite is a bit of a shame. If you want privacy for your first night as a married couple it means taking over an entire lodge. The quality and comfort of the rooms is excellent, though, and the continental breakfast served the morning after in the East Lodge was delicious, with ample options for Vegan and Gluten Free.

Jenkinsons are the exclusive caterer for Bredenbury and have an extensive menu for nibbles, the wedding breakfast and dinner. The menu and ordering process is clear, and pricing is what we expected to pay. Food and service was as slick and faff-free as everything else. A real delight.

On the day, Harriet and the catering manager were absolute superstars. Zero stress, everything ran to time and as planned, and they were always available if we had any questions or needed help.

The whole day was perfect and exactly what we wanted. I don't think we could have achieved this without the exceptional organisation of Harriet and the team. The entire process was very slick, zero stress, and we wouldn't hesitate in recommending Bredenbury Court Barns to anyone looking to get married in a countryside paradise."
V119,Bredenbury Court Barns,"I want to say a massive thank you to Bredenbury Court Barns for hosting our wedding. From the start they were super amazing and accommodating to us. They won us over with their care and support even when we had a pickle in the beginning.

Olivia was super helpful from the start and throughout the year we were planning she offered huge amount of support and suggestions.

We typed in “orangery weddings” in google when we were first looking because I was keen to get a ceremony in an orangery and Bredenbury popped up after much searching. Once we saw the Orangery we cancelled every other viewing we had across the country because we felt we found the perfect place, and nothing compared to the reception with the beautiful windows that brought all the light in. The grounds were absolutely spectacular and gorgeous. It was a no brainer for us to pick such a beautiful venue. They brought my ideas to life and we were able to get support on anything from recommendation of suppliers, to ideas on decor to their favourite meals from Jenkinson’s. They fully outdid themselves in love for us. We can’t forget it.

Our wedding day was exceptional with Lianna helping us all the way. She was a breath of fresh air. She cared about all the little details and made us feel relaxed and had a good laugh with us. The fact she was there 100% of the way, before the wedding, during the wedding, and even after is unmatched! Thank you Lianna for really being there to make our wedding day smooth and relaxing.

The food was incredible too and we often think about how sad it is that we didn’t finish our second plates, we think about it a lot.

Thank you for the wonderful journey BCB, you blew us away with your integrity, kindness, and genuine support!"
V119,Bredenbury Court Barns,thank you to everyone at bredenbury court barns who made our day so special
V119,Bredenbury Court Barns,"From the moment we stepped foot into Bredenbury Court Barns, we knew this was the venue for us. It was the first and only venue we viewed as we were blown away by how gorgeous the venue is. The venue itself is absolutely stunning, with breathtaking views and impeccably maintained grounds that set the perfect backdrop for our special day.

The staff went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. From our first consultation to the last dance, their professionalism and attention to detail were exceptional. Harriet was absolutely brilliant and I don’t know what we would have done without her!

The food was another highlight—our guests are still talking about how delicious everything was! Jenkinsons are amazing, they helped us personalise our menu perfectly!

We couldn’t have asked for a more beautiful venue to have our wedding. The day couldn’t have been more perfect! Thank you to everyone at Bredenbury Court Barns for making our wedding day nothing short of magical!"
V119,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We could not have had a more perfect experience with Bredenbury Court Barns. Right from initial booking all the way through to breakfast the following morning, everything was perfect. Nothing was too much trouble for our wonderful planner, Lianna. She ensured the day ran smoothly and our months of planning turned out exactly as we’d imagined. They are available to answer any questions you have any time, they’re only an email away and get back to you so fast. The venue itself if just gorgeous, the grounds make for some wonderful photos, and the orangery lets so much light in that your ceremony photos are gorgeous. The whole place is fully air conditioned too which was great for our July wedding. The bridal suite is a perfect balance of being aesthetically pleasing and practical for getting ready in, it’s so spacious, lots of natural light, there’s plenty of plug sockets and huge mirrors so everyone has plenty of room for getting ready and no one is on top of eachother. There’s even an outside space for getting some fresh air. I’m so glad we chose to have our wedding here, it’s given us memories to cherish forever and there are zero memories of any stress!! Cannot recommend this venue enough!"
V119,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We cannot believe how lucky we fell to get married at such a beautiful venue. Right from the offset of viewing the venue, to our special day, we were taken of. No question was too silly, and so much pressure was taken off us during the planning. We managed to make everything our own and Lianna was there every step of the way. Thank you for giving us our happily ever after. We will forever be grateful."
V119,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We loved our wedding at Bredenbury the team did an amazing job providing everything we asked for and more. We especially liked that our wedding coordinator for the day, Harriet had thought of everything for us she went above and beyond and even offered to go and get my mum some more shoes when hers broke! absolute 5-star service and the food was amazing too!"

V121,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow what can I say, Brinsop is an absolutely stunning wedding venue with heaps of character and so many options of places for the ceremony and to do things. We fell in love with it as soon as we saw it and knew it was where we wanted to get married.

Right from the start, the Brinsop team were so helpful and accommodating. From giving an virtual tour then showing us around in person, Issy and the team were fantastic right the way through. Nothing was a hassle, no request too difficult and they were incredibly professional and responsive throughout the whole process.

We loved that Brinsop is an exclusive venue with accommodation on site so we could stay with the bridal party and our immediate family. All the rooms are unique and have so much character and it's fun exploring the whole place. You feel like you are in the middle of nowhere, in nature with swans, ducks and birds all around.

Throughout our planning process, Issy and the team helped us every step of the way, being incredibly flexible in managing our requests and really trying to create our vision. They even got their team to make a giant jenga that we could use on the day! They helped to create the most perfect bespoke wedding breakfast and canapes menu, and seemed so positive and excited to be part of our special day and experience.

Arriving at the venue, Issy and the team were ready and had everything prepared and ready to go. It made the process so smooth for us and meant we could really enjoy the day without any stress. Issy coordinated perfectly with all of our vendors and it really felt like she and the whole team were so happy for us and wanted to be part of our day which was amazing. Our guests commented on how friendly and responsive all the staff were and it really made the experience extra special.

I wouldn't change anything about the day and it was perfect. I would absolutely recommend Brinsop as a wedding venue and all the staff who are really invested in helping deliver your vision. Thank you so so much to the whole team for making this a day that we will look back on for many years to come with amazing memories."
V121,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow, what a perfect day we had! It really went without a hitch and that was thanks to Nina and all the staff at Brinsop. The team worked seamlessly to ensure the day was as perfect as could be, and it really was! The wedding was booked over 2 years in advance and the staff were so accommodating with all my questions, planning and site visits, they couldn’t do more to support us. Special thanks to our coordinator Nina who was a delight to work with and a credit to Brinsop. Everyone that attended agreed at how beautiful the venue and grounds were, it was a wedding people won’t forget! 10/10 would recommend to anyone!"
V121,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"It's taken me quite a while to get round to writing this review, because sadly it's quite a bittersweet one.

We were married last year on 15 June and Brinsop was our chosen venue for both our ceremony and reception. We were first attracted to brinsop by the accomodation, meaning our loved ones could stay on-site, especially my grandparents which was so important to me.

The home itself is absolutely beautiful, including ivy cottage which myself and my mum stayed in the night before the big day. It really was a picture perfect setting, and looking down from the bridal suite seeing the ceremony space being set up on the Wordsworth lawn was honestly magical. Id dreamed of an outdoor wedding on that lawn, and we were so grateful the weather cleared so we could have it. The team really did wait till the latest they could to ask us to make a call on an inside or outside wedding (despite being June, it was a gloomy day to start) which I really appreciated!

Another amazing part of hiring brinsop was the after hours space we were able to enjoy until 2am with our house guests. The games room was absolute fantastic and meant that if you wanted to go to bed you could, but you could also stay up, party and play pool. I really do think this was a highlight for our guests and would recommend massively if you can spare some budget.

On the night of the wedding, myself and my new husband actually stayed in one glamping tents which we absolutely loved. The groundsman was on site until we were ready to leave the games room, and he then took us up to our tent in one of the buggies, making sure we had plenty of blankets and even stopping off for some bottles of water for us. This was really special, and can't thank him enough.

Hugo Spritz!! Having hugos at both our welcome drinks and drinks reception after the ceremony was amazing. I'm not a fan of prosecco myself and Mark and the team made it possible for us to have Hugo's all round. We even sneaked some up to the bridal suite to have before the ceremony (thanks Nadia!). Our guests loved them, and the amount of people that have told me they now need them at their own wedding is crazy!

Onto the not so good - sadly it all started to go a little downhill when we moved things into the knot barn for our wedding breakfast. Sitting on the top table, I could see that guests at the top of the second rows of long tables didn't really even have a seat around the table and were just kind of plonked on. The seating plan hadn't been followed, and I don't think there were even enough tables laid for the service to be comfortable for people because there was a dance floor at the end of the barn (which I did not ask for).

It was quickly also brought to my attention, that one of our guests had had to put her child on her lap in order to remove the high chair so people had more space. We also lost about 5 napkins with them setting on fire from the candles because everything was just way too cramped.

I asked to speak to catering, and asked if there was anything that they could do. I was told 'well sure, if you want the whole thing to be late'. In truth I shouldn't have even had to broach this myself, as it should have been sorted by the coordination team.

The tables weren't changed, even after they'd said they'd sort after the first course and yet the whole meal still ran late. We've had so much feedback about people not having enough food, food not being easy to access on the sharing platters etc and honestly when you've waited so long for a day and had spent 25k on the venue and food alone, it really has been heartbreaking to hear. I do sometimes question why people still bring it up (even now, people talk about the dining) when it clearly upset me so much.

Whilst writing this review my husband asked my what we had for evening food - we didn't get any. It was left unannounced on a back table. I don't know what I was expecting, just not that.

The next morning, the houseguests were asked to come down to breakfast for 9am (it was on a note in the room) but as we were in the glamping area, we walked past the knot barn just before 8.30 and the food was already out. We ran down to the house to hurry everyone up, and by which time everyone arrived it had been sitting there for 20plus mins going cold.

My biggest upset was that when I fed all of the above back to brinsop, feeling pretty deflated about the catering, I was told they'd pass my feedback on and heard absolutely nothing back. 25k total with over 10k on food and drinks to hear absolutely nothing, and this was 9 months ago. I'm not saying this in would happen to anyone else, but really - it shouldn't have happened to us either."
V121,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our wedding! From start to finish, everything at Brinsop was flawless. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most magical backdrop for our special day. Our guests were blown away by the beautiful venue, the warm atmosphere, and the seamless coordination. Every detail was taken care of, and we felt so well looked after. The team was incredible, professional, friendly, and attentive. On the day itself, they ensured everything ran smoothly, allowing us to truly enjoy every moment. A special mention goes to our amazing wedding coordinator Nina!"
V121,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We had our wedding on New Year's Eve 2024 at Brinsop, and it was more perfect that we could have ever hoped for. The venue itself is stunning, with beautiful spacious rooms which slept over 40 of our guests. Our coordinator, Nina, was incredible and so supportive on the day - she kept everything running so smoothly and everything went by without a glitch. The food and drink managers Mark and Amy did the most incredible job - nothing was ever too much, they were so attentive, and the chefs the most stunning meal after we gave them a fairly vague brief of 'curry'! We had the most perfect day and we're so incredibly grateful to Brinsop and the team."
V121,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,Brinsop Court is pure magic—an unforgettable venue with an incredible team!
V121,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We were lucky enough to have our wedding at Brinsop Court in December, and it was an absolutely spectacular day. We fell in love with Brinsop as soon we set our eyes on the beautiful manor and surrounding gardens. Cate, Amy, Mark and the rest of the wonderful staff at Brinsop really go the extra mile to make you feel special, and are extremely flexible with requests in order to make your day feel more special. We honestly felt like there was no request too big leading up to the day and they really made us feel extremely comfortable leading up to the day.
On the day, Cate and her team were well on hand to help us with setting up everything and she had everything under control when there were a few hiccups. The day itself was absolutely magical, and that wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for everyone at Brinsop working extremely hard to ensure that everything went to plan and as smoothly as it could.
Thank you to everyone at Brinsop for making us feel at ease and ensuring that our wedding was an amazing day."
V121,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Brinsop, the perfect wedding venue! We got married at Brinsop in December and I can honestly say it was everything we could have hoped for and more. We found out about the venue through Hitched and was one of only two venues that we visited but as soon as we got the house we knew it was the one. We fell in love with everything about it and it was fair to say that our guests agreed with us with many saying it was the nicest venue they’d been to. We had the wonderful Nina as our coordinator and she was brilliant! Nothing was too much trouble and we had constant communication with her in the build up which helped our stress levels no end. The same can be said for all of the staff who were brilliant throughout and allowed us to have the best day of our lives with everything running seamlessly. A special mention must be given to Amy and the catering staff who put on such an incredible menu (including the tasting session that provided some of the best food we’d ever had) and ensured that the food has been one of the main things that people have mentioned to us since the wedding! We had our ceremony in the Banqueting Hall which provided the perfect setting, especially with it being a winter wedding, as it really added to the cosy atmosphere and the lounge areas/games room were perfect for the drink’s reception. We would have loved to have also had it in the courtyard, but the temperatures meant that the lounge with the fireplace was a far more appealing option on the day. We then had the wedding breakfast and reception in the knot barn which was decorated beautifully and was the perfect place for the party in the evening. Overall we really can’t thank everyone at Brinsop enough for making our day what it was, we can honestly say that we have been made to feel part of the family and already can’t wait to hopefully come back to stay in one of the cottages for our first anniversary!"
V121,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Where do I start!!
Brinop Court is the most stunning venue, it was the first venue we visited and instantly fell in love! Theres so much history to the house and we were treated like family every time we visited before the wedding and it literally felt like home the whole weekend of the wedding, my guests also agreed!!

A special thank you to Issy our coodinator who went above and beyond ti make sure everything was perfect for us. It was so easy to plan and nothing was too much to ask, even arranging our dog to be our ring bearer!! When they say Brinsop is dog friendly they really mean it!!!

What a place, what a day!! Thank you so much everyone, you all made our day perfect and it really was the best day of our lives♥️"
V121,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We got married at the gorgeous Brinsop in October this year. It’s hard to put into words how amazing the whole experience was. We honestly had the best day of our lives!!!

We fell in love with Brinsop during our first visit back in December 2022. We knew almost immediately that Brinsop was the venue we were looking for! From the outside the venue looked like a painting - from the picturesque views of the countryside, to the swans swimming on the moat! The manor house itself has so much character, and has a lovely homely feel to it as you walk around it. Our guests were equally blown away by the venue!

A big thing for us was that it’s dog friendly, which meant we could have our two dogs join us on our special day, it wouldn’t have been the same without them there! They had so much fun walking around the grounds and greeting all of our guests!

Nina, our coordinator, and her team were always available to answer any of our questions in the run up to the day. This really put us at ease, knowing we were in safe hands. On the day, Nina and the team made sure everything ran smoothly and went above and beyond to ensure our guests were looked after. A shout out to Amy who heads up catering and Mark who manages the bar. The food and drinks were absolutely fantastic!

I highly recommend this venue! There’s a reason Brinsop is an award winning venue - and when you visit it’s not hard to see why. We are already looking forward to going back there for a date night next year! Thanks for everything Team Brinsop!

V122,The Manor at Bickley,"The Manor is the perfect venue for weddings! When our wedding venue fell through 4 months before the big day, I stumbled onto the Manor at Bickley and spoke to Craig. He was most helpful and kind and went above and beyond to make sure our wedding went ahead.

We hired the venue for our two day wedding and the staff were helpful and accommodating from start to finish. All of our guests were awed by the beautiful well kept grounds and the excellent service. We can’t thank the staff enough for making our wedding dreams a reality. They thought of every detail from bringing us champagne after our civil ceremony to making sure we had our card box at the end of the night! We are excited to head back to celebrate our anniversary there!"
V122,The Manor at Bickley,"Myself and my Husband chose this venue for our wedding last week and we can’t sing The Manor’s praises enough. From our very first enquiry, to the first viewing of the venue, right though until the big day, the staff at the manor have been nothing short of brilliant! Each staff member we came across was polite and accommodating. Special mention to Craig and Vicky with whom we did most of our liaising throughout the months leading up until our wedding. Craig and Vicky were super helpful, responsive and went above and beyond to make sure that we could have the day of our dreams. Even with last minute changes due to the weather, Craig who was just incredible throughout, managed to help us sort a backup plan so our day would still go ahead seamlessly.

The rooms at the manor were spacious and modern, giving us and our wedding party lots of space for photographers and videographers to capture the special moments on our wedding morning.

The lodge that was used for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready was fabulous. The manor was very flexible in giving us early access so we could get ready on time.

The grand marquee was definitely grand! Very spacious and when decorated looked like something out of a fairytale! lots of kitchen space, a huge bar and fantastic overhead speakers for the party!

The manor was super flexible to our needs regarding access, start times, outsourcing our vendors and much more. The venue is beautiful and spacious with options for outdoor and indoor events and entertainment. The grounds were absolutely beautiful, so many lovely spots for photos not only for us as the bride and groom but for guests too!

A very special thank you to our point of contact throughout, Craig. From our first meeting, he was charming, bubbly and made us feel super welcome. He reassured us that he has experience in African/Caribbean weddings and that our wedding day would amazing and it was. He was attentive and always let us know that he was only a phone call or e-mail away and was always quick to respond and answer any questions we had.

All in all, we had the most beautiful day at The manor and we would definitely recommend this venue for a wedding or other events.

V122,The Manor at Bickley,"We hired The Manor at Bickley for my daughters wedding. Got a brilliant service from the venue. Everything was set accordingly, as per floor plan. Our guests were loved the venue grounds/facilities and the overall wedding set up.
Thank you to everyone at Bickley."
V122,The Manor at Bickley,"A warm and friendly service from the very helpful staff, a feeling that it is your own house! The food was amazing and the atmosphere made us and our guests feel fantastic."
V123,Davenport House,We are so pleased we chose Davenport House for our wedding reception. Charley and the team were so helpful and thoughtful. Putting canapés behind the bar for us and making sure everything ran so smoothly. I am obsessed with the stunning house and grounds and it was absolutely perfect! Thank you so much for making our day so special!!
V123,Davenport House,"Davenport House is a STUNNING wedding venue so how could we not have it for our big day!?

The staff were exceptional! From the moment we booked through to our big day, we had an absolute blast and could not thank each member of staff enough! Special shout out to Jared (hopefully spelt right, haha!) who made sure we were fed, watered and ensured we took 5 minutes to ourselves every moment we could - Also even saved us slices of pie wedding cake before we went to bed!

Our guests have said they have never been to a wedding so spectacular, with the most amazing food and amazing staff so could not have been happier having Davenport as our venue! 🩷"
V123,Davenport House,"I just wanted to write to say a huge, enormous thank you to Charley and all the team at Davenport House. We still can’t believe how perfect our day was, and lots of our guests have told us it’s the best wedding they’ve ever been to. The team were all a huge part of making that happen. It was incredibly seamless and well planned on the day, meaning we genuinely didn’t have to think about a thing, except for enjoying ourselves. The day ran to schedule perfectly and even certain touches we didn’t know or expect to happen were planned by you and the team, which made the day even more special. Thank you so much for giving us our dream wedding day. We can’t wait to see the full set of pictures and the video now to relive it all!"
V123,Davenport House,"Without doubt the best day of our lives. From start to finish, Davenport has exceeded expectations. From the very first impression of the venue during the open day, the incredible food tasting evening, all the way through to the day itself, including the support and preparation leading up to it. It was really important to us to pick a venue that not only ticked the fairytale box, but also come with the complete support of a wedding planner, due to our busy jobs. We were lucky enough to have Charley as ours. She really took the time to listen and get to know us, to ensure the day was tailored to exactly what we wanted. We even had our own cocktail designed, which went down an absolute storm on the day! She considered every little detail, constantly putting our minds at ease, which made the whole process so easy and enjoyable. Honestly the day couldn’t have gone smoother, any anxiety or stress faded immediately as soon as we got to the venue. It was simply perfect. So many of our guests were complimentary of just how beautiful the venue is and just how well organised the day was, and that is the perfect way to summarise Davenport. Any prospective couples thinking of selecting Davenport as their venue, hesitate no further. It will be a day you never knew was possible! We cannot thank you enough Charley and the Davenport team, if only we could live the day over and over again"
V123,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was amazing. When looking for a venue we weren't just looking for something wow, we needed to have people who were enthused and passionate about their work - we found that at Davenport House.

From our first phone call & meeting with Lizzie and Tallulah, we knew this was the place for us. Having two brides wasn’t an issue; combining British, Asian and Spanish cultures - wasn't an issue; having brides enter together – wasn’t an issue. Nothing was an issue. At Davenport House, we got it all – a picturesque venue and the best team of staff anyone could ever wish for. All our external suppliers have commented what a fantastic venue you are. All out guests have said that the service and attention to detail was second to none. The thoughtful touches like hiring a Spanish speaking waiter for the table which spoke very little English ensured that everyone felt welcomed. Guests with dietary requirements didn't feel they got a second rate meal or they were an afterthought - the food for all throughout the day was exceptional. The rooms / cottages where our guests and we stayed, spotless and comfortable. The thought behind adding some cheese and Spanish ham to the morning breakfast - so sweet!

Special shout out to Megan - wedding planner extraordinaire who kept in touch throughout the planning process and was exceptional on the day. Ian who worked tirelessly to ensure the day ran smoothly and the food was perfect, Charley who was also in charge of one bride and ensuring that everything was on point. All the staff were fantastic - polite, professional and personal.

Everyone keeps saying that this was the best wedding they have ever attended and that’s a lot of weddings between people! When we asked why, they say things like ‘the venue’, ‘the staff’, but it all came back to the inclusivity, love & joy that they felt – and you were all a part of that.

Davenport House is a stunning venue made even better by those who work there. If you want the whole package on your wedding day, we strongly recommend you book them.

Thank you to the entire Davenport House team.

Sat and Ana xx"
V123,Davenport House,"Where to begin with our beautiful venue and thanking the people who made it all happen! We got married in November at Davenport House and it was easily the best day of our lives. We chose Davenport because we wanted to host our cosy winter wedding in a big grand house in the country, with all the grandeur and class but to still feel like an intimate celebration with our family and closest friends, and it was perfect in delivering just that. It is utterly beautiful, the location was perfect and exactly what we wanted. The food was absolutely AMAZING, we had so many compliments from our guests and we are so grateful for the team in delivering such a fabulous wedding breakfast. Thank you so much to Lizzie who couldn’t do more to help us have our dream day, and Ian who delivered the best service to us and our guests (the pizza at 2am was very much appreciated)

Massive massive thank you to Charley our wedding planner, who was so so helpful throughout our wedding planning process and on the day, I can’t thank her enough. She was always there whenever I needed her, helped me so much with creating our dream day and I will be forever grateful to her for keeping me sane! Whenever I had any worries I knew she was just a phone call away, which helped me a lot when planning a wedding!

Charley, Lizzie and Ian thank you for everything - best team ever. Our day was seamless and it was all down to you and your incredible team.

Jess and Sam xx"
V123,Davenport House,"Me and my (now) wife chose Davenport House as our wedding venue in mid 2022, to get married in September 2023, and it was the best decision we could have made. We looked at a range of Georgian style manor house type venues located in Cheshire, North Wales and the West Midlands areas. It blew all of the competition away in terms of the venue aesthetics, the balance in design (i.e. period characteristics vs modern design), the impressive condition of the property for its age plus what it offered for our wedding weekend.

Staff and service - In the UK, this is usually something that is average at best - if you're lucky. At Davenport House, the service from all staff was 10/10. I honestly don't think we've ever had better service for anything. We had a wedding planner from the start (Megan), who was an absolute saint and was fundamental in making the whole wedding a success. She was also instrumental in helping us find a way for our 'little' dog Bernie to be a part of the main event. Thanks Megan!

Accommodation - The fantastic condition, design and decor for Davenport House extends to all areas of the estate. The rooms are fantastic, very big, well maintained and cleaned religiously by the venue. We had no issues or problems from all of the guests who stayed onsite over the 3 days.

Food and drink - This got a lot of deserved praise from the guests too. We got to tailor our entire menu and it worked perfectly for what we wanted for the 3 days. The oyster bar and luxurious charcuterie board went down particularly well the day before the wedding.

I could keep writing much, much more on how fantastic this venue was for our wedding. But the best advice I could give for any interested couples is to go and visit it in person and reach out to Davenport House with any questions. Our own wedding ended up becoming both perfect and the best wedding we've ever been to. Thanks guys again!"
V123,Davenport House,"Fantastic location.
Great staff.
Beautiful place to get married.
I can wait to film here again soon thanks for having me."
V123,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was a fairytale, everything we could have dreamed of and more. Lizzie and Charley were fantastic in their support, organisation and professionalism in planning our wedding. The venue is simply spectacular- breathtaking. Our guests were blown away. The day ran so smoothly it was simply perfect. The food was out of this world our guests couldn't get enough. All the staff at the house went above and beyond to ensure we were happy and having a great day. The team were also extremely supportive of last minute changes/additions. The Davenport experience was truly wonderful and I'm sad to see it end right from our initial meetings, food tasting and finally our special day. Thank you: Lizzie, Charley, Ian and all of the team for a truly memorable day for us and our guests. Mr and Mrs Kissane"
V123,Davenport House,"We got married at Davenport House in February and they provided us with the most perfect day. Lizzie, Charley, Ian and the rest of the team were the best hosts we could have hoped for. Nothing was too much to ask and the guests all commented on the hospitality shown to them. The setting is utterly gorgeous, our weather was less than favourable so we did not make the most of the grounds but this didn't matter, the house was setting enough and so atmospheric! The food was utterly AMAZING and better than most restaurant food I have eaten. The venue feels intimate and grand at the same time.
I literally cannot recommend this place enough, they gave us the wedding we had always wanted and more!"

V125,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge on 12 May 2023 and it was incredible. The views are gorgeous and the photo opportunities are endless with beautiful floral and green surroundings. The team were super responsive throughout the process which is really reassuring and helpful when planning a wedding, and Nelson who ran the day was just fantastic. Every single detail was thought of and they run a really slick operation. This is essential as it meant I had a lot less to think about! They put me and my partner at ease throughout. The food and service on the day was fantastic, so many of our guests said this was the best food they’ve ever had at a wedding. Highly recommend! (Photos by Costa Weddings UK)"
V125,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","Pembroke where super helpful and provided a lot of guidance in helpful forms and layouts. Always available for a call and very helpful. on the day, it ran super smooth and and staff where lovely. Thank yo for making it a great day!"
V125,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge in October 2024. The whole day was magical, including the beautiful view over the autumn trees in Richmond Park. Robert made sure everything ran perfectly and helped us to find slots in the busy wedding timetable to fit in some special moments to also reflect traditions from my husband's Dutch culture. The food was great and the staff were polite and fun. All preparation with Lucy was also smooth and done with a smile. The Pembroke Lodge team ooze experience but make every wedding feel special and really listen to your wishes for the day. Highly recommend! Thank you to the whole Pembroke Lodge team, especially Robert, Lucy, the kitchen team and the staff on the day!"
V125,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park",The staff has been very helpful. They have a lot of experience. Open to any suggestions and help in critical situations.
V125,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue than Pembroke Lodge for our summer wedding. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most gorgeous backdrop for our special day. A huge thank you to our banqueting manager, Nelson, who went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly.

The team was incredibly supportive and accommodating throughout the planning process, making it an enjoyable and stress-free experience. Their professionalism and attention to detail made all the difference, and we’re so grateful for everything they did to make our day unforgettable. Highly recommend!"
V125,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We got married on the 3rd of October this year, and the team made our day magical! What a smooth day. We loved every second of it! The guests loved everything, and raved about the food and organisation.
Hiring Pembroke Lodge was easy. We had a viewing where all information was shared in detail and super clear to understand and make a decision.
On the months leading up to the big day our contact was Alice. Alice is a star. Responsive, professional, and had answers and solutions to everything.
On the day, Nelson coordinated the whole thing, minute by minute, and we are forever grateful for his politeness, professionalism and high spirits. We felt safe and in good hands. I would give Pembroke Lodge way over 5 stars if I could :)"
V125,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","My wedding went without a hitch, thanks to the amazing team at Pembroke Lodge (special thanks to Nicola & Robert)! They made sure everything was set up perfectly on the day, exactly in the way we had requested, and then ensured the day itself went as smoothly as we could've hoped. Everything looked beautiful and the stunning views made all of our guests fall in love with the venue too."
V125,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had the most perfect day. The team have all been so responsive and accommodating of our every request. The venue is beautiful and we were lucky to have gorgeous sunset views. It is truly a countryside wedding but conveniently close to London, which was important for our overseas guests. The food was fantastic and staff were professional and efficient. Would recommend to anyone."
V125,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We recently had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge, and I cannot say enough good things about the venue, the team and manager, Robert. From the moment we started planning to the big day itself, he was absolutely incredible.

Robert went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. He was always available to answer our questions, offer solutions, and provide creative suggestions that enhanced our vision. He coordinated effortlessly with our vendors, making sure everyone was on the same page, which took so much stress off our shoulders.

On the day of the wedding, he was a true rockstar! He made sure the timeline flowed perfectly, from setting up the ceremony space to ensuring the reception transitions were seamless. His dedication and hands-on approach allowed us to enjoy every moment without worrying about a single thing.

Our wedding was a dream come true, and we owe so much of that to him and the team! Thank you, for everything you all did to make our day magical."
V125,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We could not have wished for a better wedding venue for our special day! Everyone went above and beyond to make sure our day goes perfectly without us having to worry about a single thing! A big shoutout to Nelson who was absolutely brilliant and made the day feel so calm and well thought through.

The food was delicious and all the team was so welcoming and super helpful on the day.

Thank you so much, we really really appreciate all the help!"
V126,The Hackney,"If you are having a wedding for under 60 people then this is your place! From start to finish the communication and planning of the wedding was seamless and took so much of the stress out of the day. The totally customisable packages that they offer really does suit anyone’s budget and more importantly regardless of what package you end up going for it is value for money. The food was delicious and it catered to everyone’s tastes including a pregnant guest, halal, vegan and lactose intolerant and was the talking point for our guests. The venue itself is stunning! Lots of exposed brick, they had recently redecorated before our wedding and the reception room that doubled up as the dance floor was styled simply but made a statement and the outdoor covered patio area was a welcome addition. The team understood our vision from the get go and they completely nailed it, all of our guests couldn’t believe it was here! I honestly can’t recommend it enough if you’re wanting a small and intimate wedding venue but still with all the class. I would say to future couples even if you think this wouldn’t be your venue please please do have a proper look because it will change your mind, I had come across this venue multiple times over the course of a year and decided to take a leap of faith and give it a chance and we’re so happy we did."
V126,The Hackney,"We can’t recommend the Hackney highly enough. They made the whole process so easy and they offer so much in-house which we took advantage of. The food was especially great - our guests were amazed “best food I’ve ever had at a wedding” and the team took great care of us during the planning stages.

They offer a very customisable service with scalable pricing. If you’re having a fairly small wedding (under 60) then you must check out The Hackney.

We had such a perfect day and we owe so much of that to the fabulous venue. Beautiful space, so professionally run."
V126,The Hackney,"We had such a brilliant experience working with the team at The Hackney. We were regularly in touch throughout the planning process and the use of the shared spreadsheet was especially handy for keeping everyone informed.
We had to postpone our wedding two days before as we were both sick with COVID, and the team were just fantastic. They waited for us to recover and then we started to talk through options again. We were able to rebook just six months after our original date, and the team were accomodating and understanding throughout the process.
The day itself was perfect. Lots of our guests commented on the quality and quantity of the food and Hugo was great at keeping everything to time. We wish we could do it all again."
V126,The Hackney,"We had our wedding reception here and wow was it amazing. Hugo, Erika and the whole team were amazing. Every single guest commented on how delicious and plentiful the food was. The staff were amazing nothing was too much to ask and all so happy.
The venue itself was decorated amazingly, given we left our wedding stationary etc up to the venue it exceeded our expectations. I was concerned about the allowed decibel level for Dj / entertainment but it was plenty loud enough. I wish I could relive the day again, if you’re thinking about booking The Hackney do it! You will not regret!"
V126,The Hackney,"We held our wedding reception at The Hackney in July and it was truly the best experience. We opted for a standing reception for our 65 guests, serving food bowl-style for a more relaxed, less formal feel. The food was absolutely delicious and there was lots of it - it just kept coming! Our guests are still raving about how good the food was months later! Lots of good drinks options too - we especially like the cocktails here!

The staff on the night were so friendly, welcoming and were amazing with our children guests too!

The Hackney is such an aesthetic venue with exposed brick walls and existing foliage which we loved, so we kept additional decorations to a minimum. We dropped our decorations to The Hackney the day before and picked them up the day after, which was super easy! We hadn’t given them too much direction with where we wanted everything placed but when we turned up to the venue on the day it was truly perfect! The staff know exactly what they’re doing and had decorated it beautifully! The outdoor seating area is a great feature too (especially for our two greyhounds who chilled out there for the majority of the reception!)

We opted for a simple Spotify playlist for our music and their sound system was good.

The wedding planning process was super easy from start to finish, with continued support and check-ins from Hugo, from the moment we booked, to the day itself! We really enjoyed the menu tasting experience earlier in the year too, which is a great touch in the build up to the big day! The planning spreadsheet was easy to use and made us feel content and relaxed, knowing that everything was under control.

Overall, we would highly recommend The Hackney to anyone looking for an affordable, dog-friendly, wedding reception venue with a laidback vibe, delicious food and lovely friendly staff! We look forward to coming back every year to celebrate our anniversary, with an espresso martini!"
V126,The Hackney,"We hosted our wedding reception with the team at the hackney in May 2023. The planning experience was straight forward and easy to book. The availability for the venue is on the website so easy to see when they have and get it booked. We went with the 5 canapés, bowl food menu, and drinks on arrival with wine through the event. The staff were brilliant and food delicious.

We loved the vibe of the venue as we wanted a bit more of a casual event, with a relaxed feel and we were able to host our 85 guests with no issues (although limited to standing event at this size, there is enough scattered seating for anyone to sit when they wanted).

In terms of decorating, we didn't feel the need to add any extra flowers as the venue was already so made up with plants and other decorations.

We did add the photo box which I highly recommend, was great fun for our friends and family and came with a memory book. People were shy at first but really got into it. We also used the recommended baker who provided a delicious cake.

Final area to mention - pricing. Wedding venues can be really expensive and daunting before you even start paying for any food or drink. Something that really attracted us to this venue was the low spacing cost and the minimum spend with it. It meant that we were able to completely customise the experience and see where the money we were spending was going. There are many different options and packages to go with, so it's up to you.

Only thing that wasn't offered was any tasting of the food beforehand which we would've liked to have done but none the less, the food was delicious so it wasn't really needed!

To finish, we loved every moment of it and hope that many others get to experience the same. Thank you very much team at the hackney!"
V126,The Hackney,"We had our reception in July. The venue was cosy and comfortably fit 30 people without feeling too crowded or too empty (we were worried it might be too empty). We managed to fit a band in, arranged mini-golf in the venue after dinner, and customize the cocktail menu with custom recipe (that we provided before hand).

One of the biggest highlights was the food. The crispy roast pork got so many complements and indeed it was tasty. But really, all the dishes were amazing (we had a tasting session prior), it was hard to choose, but the taste of each dish was still top notch on the day itself too. I heard that the supper snacks we ordered were great too but alas, I was too busy and they were snapped up instantly!

Some other details:
* We were allowed to use the small room downstairs as a private space to put our stuff. Very handy to not mess up items.
* We went with a bar tab and kept increasing the budget each time till the end of the night instead of the all-you-can-drink. From our rough calculations, it worked out about the same going for all-you-can-drink. Of course, certain folk were heavy weights and more than made it up will be different for each crowd.
* Lighting for photos came out excellent (combination of photographer and venue lighting).
* You can adjust air conditioning to suit the weather (we had ours on the warm side due to older folk not dealing with cold too well).
* Outdoor space was a pleasant change in atmosphere for those who wanted some fresh air.

What about the review from the Bride? Bride approved this review."
V126,The Hackney,"The day was fabulous - Hugo was brilliant and flexible with what we were after. The tasting day before was such a great idea and the whole experience and guidance given made planning a wedding in c.5 months so much easier. We had vegans, last minute drop outs, ridiculously hot weather, about 3 different spotify playlists, a string quartet, florists arriving in the morning and a cake that arrived the day before - the team took it all in their stride and it seemed like a breeze. Loved it all and we've had such good feedback from guests. A fabulous whirlwind.

Two very minor points for feedback - we maxed out the guest numbers (the team did advise us against it but were very accommodating despite us also throwing musicians into the mix) and it was a little too crowded pre-lunch on such a hot day. We also put some speeches in between courses (again, we were recommended against it) and that may have been a slight mistake for the dessert timings, as the tasting day was 10/10. But, it was a perfect day in a stunning venue. Loved it - thank you guys."
V126,The Hackney,"Jon and the team were absolute superstars, hosting the perfect wedding day for us. The space is beautiful, the decor is modern and perfect. They were so accommodating for any request or question we had which we really appreciated. Guests commented on how great the cocktails were! The day ran so smoothly and we had a fantastic time."
V126,The Hackney,"From the initial phonecall to the warm welcome we got when we first visited The Hackney, we knew we were in safe hands and that we’d made the perfect choice. The venue offers the most beautiful interiors - the perfect mix of cosy, intimate and modern industrial - exactly what we were looking for!

Our entire experience with The Hackney was an absolute dream -we loved the mega organised approach to planning. Something that could have been incredibly intimidating was made so straightforward with the amazing support of Hugo the General Manager who embraced all our weird and wonderful suggestions and gave expert advice on what we could do to make things even better. We left every meeting buzzing with ideas and even more excited to welcome our closest friends and family to the big day.

The quality of the food and drinks is impeccable - every single one of our guests (even the fussiest!) has commented on how much they loved it. We absolutely loved the menu tasting, even though it made the decision even harder as everything was amazing. What makes it even better for us is living close by and being able to pop into our wedding venue for a coffee or a cocktail!

I couldn't recommend The Hackney enough - I just wish we could go back and do it all again!"
V127,PYRÁ,"We held our wedding reception at Pyra. We booked the entire venue, with the upstairs loft serving as a dance floor with bar and downstairs having tables and seating for guests.  Canapes were served upstairs and a buffet dinner was served downstairs.  We lucked out with great April weather, so guests were also able to enjoy Pyra’s patio and additional space on Lonsdale Road. We were very happy with our decision to have our reception at Pyra, and many of our guests commented on how lovely the space was, how nice the staff were, and how delicious the food was.
 
The venue:
The space is gorgeous with lots of natural light upstairs.  Guests arrived at 4pm but we had the venue for the entire day, and Pyra gave our florist access earlier to set up beautiful flower arrangements and candles - it looked stunning.  Pyra set up our welcome sign and card box too. The venue also accepted delivery of our cake on the morning of the wedding which was a huge help, set it up very nicely upstairs, and cut it for us after the formal “cake cutting” shots.  We were able to coordinate with Pyra ahead of time to arrange the space how we wanted, such as how many tables we wanted downstairs and the set-up of the loft upstairs.  They even had a microphone ready for us upstairs so we could say a few words to our guests before our cake cutting. Perfect! For the evening dancing, we were able to set the disco lighting to our colour scheme, which worked really well with candles and foliage (latter 2 provided by our florist).
 
The food:
The buffet dinner was fantastic.  Pyra gave us multiple menu items to choose from and we were able to fix a nice menu that took into account guests’ dietary restrictions.  We initially booked the venue when it had a different chef and menu.  We came in a few months before our wedding to try the new menu – our dinner was delicious then and there was no dip in quality for the buffet-style served at our reception. Fionn worked with us how to plan best - because we wanted a relaxed style with a dance floor upstairs, we ended up feeding our 80 guests in two sittings downstairs, which worked perfectly. The upstairs space can seat 60 people, which didn’t work for how we planned our event, but does look really nice in photos. The late night food served around 10pm also went down very well.
 
The staff:
The staff, including the bartenders and waiters, were hardworking, friendly and very nice to guests.  Enough staff were around that guests never had to wait long for drinks.  Members of staff cut our cake for us and also boxed up the late night food for guests to bring home.  Fionn, the day-of coordinator, was on-site for our entire reception and was very helpful, even helping coordinate our midnight bus arrival.
 
Responsiveness:
Overall we were happy with the responsiveness of the venue.  It took a little while to nail down the final details of the food menu and drinks menu/bar tab but we were ultimately very happy with the result.  As the venue hosts more weddings/ larger-scale events we’d expect this will improve.

Overall:
We highly recommend Pyra for a wedding reception. We had 80 guests in total, which worked very well for the canapes/cocktail hour upstairs (4-6pm), sit-down buffet downstairs (6-8pm, split into two seatings) and dancing upstairs (8pm-midnight).  The upstairs loft was able to fit all 80 guests plus a four-piece band.  Lonsdale Road is also a charming street that provided great photo opportunities.  We looked into several other venues, and came away happy with Pyra's quote – we were able to book the venue, food (including canapes, dinner and late night food) and a generous bar tab for roughly the amount some other London venues were charging for just their space (no food or drink included). We and our guests had a fantastic time. Thanks so much to Fionn and the Pyra team :)"
V127,PYRÁ,"We had our wedding celebration at Lula. We booked the loft and restaurant for this.

Positives:
The venue is beautiful and needs minimal decoration.
The food was amazing; the chef is truly professional and everyone loved it.
They redecorated the restaurant section and added a set of couches to make it a lounge, which was beautiful.
The staff was very hardworking, professional, and lovely.

They provided us with a lounge, a wedding breakfast space and a dance floor.

Flexibility with Cake:
The bakery was scheduled to deliver and set up the cake at 16:45, but they delivered it at 09:45 instead. The Lula team handled the situation professionally by storing the cake and setting it up at the correct time. They presented the cake beautifully and assisted in cutting it into nice pieces. It could not have been more perfect.


The list of available drinks was huge, and they were happy to make custom drinks and bring in different juices if requested in advance. The event manager tried to accommodate every wish we had, and on the day we could not have hoped for more. Most of our guests said it was one of the best weddings and most beautiful venues they had ever been to.

Negatives:
Food tasting for the wedding menu was not included, which we had assumed would be, but it was given at a 50% discount. We had to sort out the floral decoration last minute, as they had initially suggested they would arrange it for us after providing a budget, but later said we needed to find our own. At times, they were a bit slow to respond, which made us anxious, but after communicating with them, this was resolved, and communication was very swift.

In conclusion:
Lula gave us the most beautiful wedding we could have dreamt of. We highly recommend them. The venue, the food, the service were amazing, and we could not have hoped for more."
V128,Sandon Manor,"We had such a special wedding at Sandon Manor, the team made every effort to make our day so so special and we will be forever grateful for that. A dream team! The day ran so smoothly and they worked so hard. The venue is unique with lots of different spaces which unfold throughout the day, which was perfect as our wedding fell on a wet and windy autumnal day. We would highly recommend Sandon Manor!"
V128,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor provided the perfect venue for our wedding. From the initial conversations and meetings with the team, we knew we were in safe hands and had made the right choice. They kept us informed with any events, made information a bit payments clear and reassured us with any query we had.
The accommodation was exceptional and fitted our requirements perfectly, with high quality finishing touches throughout to ensure our stay was as comfortable as possible.
The wedding venue was incredible! Our ceremony took place in the gorgeously modern barn with stunning draping and greenery. Following on, we had a blissful drinks reception which was on the expertly manicured lawn (with mini golf!) and sun-trap of a courtyard. We then moved onto our wedding breakfast which was held in the main barn, seating all of our guests comfortably with space for decor and extra details. Following from dinner, the part started and the club room came to life! This was absolutely the talking point of the day and our guests raved about how incredible it was! It managed to create a club-like atmosphere, whilst maintaining the vibe, albeit at a reduced volume, in the rest of the barn. The layout of the venue was important to us, as it ensured our guests never strayed too far, to keep the momentum of the day.
The team at Sandon worked superbly with all of vendors which ensured the day ran smoothly from set up to clearing. All of our vendors commented on how much they too loved working there.
The venue, the aesthetics, the staff, everything was perfect! We would absolutely recommend to anyone getting married."
V128,Sandon Manor,"We cannot recommend Sandon Manor enough. From the quality of the service, the helpfulness and friendliness of the team, the beautiful accommodation and the most amazing venue which all or guests loved partying the night away in. To make it even more special the Manor is in amazing grounds in beautiful countryside and nature reserves.
Sandon Manor made our dream come true."
V128,Sandon Manor,"I couldn't recommend Sandon Manor highly enough - from our first enquiry to our Wedding, nothing was too much trouble. The team are so friendly and easy to communicate with, very approachable and responsive. They respond to any questions immediately and having the day before to set up with Tom was fantastic. Styaying in the Manor House and Dovecote was the icing on the cake as to be with friends and family the night before and the day after was so fabulous. On the day Tom and the team were absolutely fantastic and couldn't have done more to make our special day. We couldn't have dreamt of anywhere more perfect than Sandon Manor - a huge thank you to all the staff."
V128,Sandon Manor,"If you are considering Sandon Manor for your wedding venue, I beg you: scratch it off your list now. Yes, the house and grounds are beautiful, but the people behind it are absolutely awful. They ruined our wedding experience.

I will get straight to it. Sandon Manor has a very strict policy on guests leaving the site by 11:30pm (and no one is allowed back to the Manor unless they’re official guests staying overnight). We had lots of international guests at our wedding. Many hadn’t seen each other in years and would be jetlagged - we thought they may be keen to continue chatting after 11:30pm. With this in mind, we made a booking with Sandon Village Hall via our contacts at the church (where we were attending services and later married). They granted us access to the village hall until 1am as a contingency spill over space.

We mentioned this in passing during our online meeting with one of the Sandon Manor team a month before our wedding. Within hours, I received a voicemail from the lady in charge of Village Hall bookings saying (quote) “someone at Sandon Manor is trying to throw a spanner into the works for you”. It soon transpired that they had raised an official complaint to the parish council and pressurised the village hall team into cancelling our booking. To be clear, Sandon village Hall and Sandon Manor are entirely separate entities – there is no crossover between them whatsoever, as the owner of Sandon Manor later acknowledged.

It gets worse. Gob smacked, we asked Kate – the owner of Sandon Manor – for a call to find out what was going on. She was abhorrent, trying to justify her meddling as a necessary measure to protect her wedding license (side note: with Sandon Manor it is always about the money – once your deposit is paid they care nothing for your ‘special day’; you are just another cash cow). Did she apologise for stabbing us, her clients, in the back? No, she did not. She could not even fathom how hurt we were by being completely bypassed in the communication chain and how deceitful and disrespectful this was. My husband and I were quite literally left speechless. We’ve never experienced this sort of treatment from anyone, let alone our wedding venue - to whom we were paying many thousands of pounds. Dealing with this stress in the final month of wedding prep really took its toll on us and soured things. We no longer looked forward to our day, rather dreaded what Sandon Manor might do next.

Aside from this major incident, there were many other occasions when Sandon Manor were unhelpful and unfeeling in their interactions with us:

- We enquired if it would be possible to arrange a large pizza takeaway order instead of using Sandon Manor’s caterer for our late night food. One of the team explained on a call that this wasn’t contractually possible; we acknowledged this. We then received an email saying ‘If you are unable to follow this or any other of our T&C's we would be happy to cancel your booking.’ This was less than a month before our wedding.
- We had a harpist perform in the church. We were told she wasn’t allowed to play during our drinks reception in the grounds due to potential noise complaints (an acoustic harp at 2pm in the afternoon). No other music was permitted outside the house.
- Sandon Manor is an incredibly expensive (in hindsight, grossly overpriced) venue. But we were also hit with hidden fees when booking their accommodation option - an extra £425 ‘cleaning fee’ was added to our bill.
- At the time of booking, Sandon was running a promotion waivering the £700 fee for hiring their ceremony space. As we were marrying at the church, we asked if it would please be possible to put this towards other elements of our day i.e. using their festoon string of lights in the barn (for which they charge £450). They refused.
- We were unsure about booking the 1-bed Dovecote on the grounds as - at £499 for the weekend - it was a considerable expense. While we were deciding Sandon Manor rented it out on Air BnB (to one of our guests, which made for a very awkward conversation).

To summarise, you only get one wedding day. Kate and her team absolutely ruined ours. There are so many other lovely venues in north Hertfordshire run by decent, humane people. Please prioritise your happiness and choose wisely. I wish we had."
V128,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor is a stunning wedding venue with a great team behind it. The exclusive use of the manor for the weekend was a highlight, allowing us to relax with friends and family in the lead up to and after the big day. The Sandon team were brilliant, guiding us through the planning process and ensuring everything ran smoothly on the day. We couldn't have asked for a better place and team to help us celebrate our big day."
V128,Sandon Manor,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our special day. Holly, Tom and the rest of the brilliant team made us feel welcome from day one. Special mention to Tom for making the day run so seamlessly, so professional and accommodating of all our needs.

The venue itself is stunning, located in the beautiful Hertfordshire countryside. The Manor House makes for a tremendous location to prepare, and the Dovecote suite is a nice touch: a great addition for the groom to spend the last night. We loved the small details of the characteristic main venue, with the botanical feel to the bar a great backdrop to the barn.

It’s a shame we can’t stay every week!

Dan & Suzanne"
V128,Sandon Manor,"To Holly, Louise, Tom & Kate, wow, what can we say but the biggest thank you for the best day of our lives! When we viewed the beautiful venue over two years ago we just knew instantly Sandon Manor was the one, not just because it’s stunning, but you guys are amazing! Thank you for making all our wedding dreams come true. Forever grateful and can’t wait to return to reminisce. Lots of love, the new Mr & Mrs Jakes xxx"
V128,Sandon Manor,"From the moment we visited Sandon Manor we knew this would be our wedding venue for 9 September 2023. Seeing the spectacular finish of the house carry through to the completed venue just shows the high level of attention to detail this venue had to offer.

Holly, Tom and the rest of the team filled us with confidence right from our first interactions, annd went above and beyond on the wedding weekend itself to facilitate us, our suppliers and guests. The main house, dovecote, annex and extensive grounds were a wonderful way to have close family stay with us on site, and so handy to be able to all get ready nearby the morning of.

Thank you for making our wedding weekend a truly memorable occasion, for us and our families. We all look back on this day with the happiest, sunniest memories and Sandon Manor will always have a very special place in our hearts."
V128,Sandon Manor,"We had the most amazing wedding weekend at Sandon Manor.

The venue itself is the perfect backdrop for a wedding, our photos looked amazing from every single angle. There were so many spaces to make use of throughout the day which helped things to run incredibly smoothly and meant we didn’t need to have a ‘turnaround’ during the evening. The spaces really wowed our guests and created such a lovely atmosphere. Including the ‘club room’ dance floor that had our guests dancing until the very last song!

We stayed at the Manor House for the weekend, extending our wedding into a perfect weekend retreat. The house itself is beautiful, with lots of different areas for everyone to relax, and the perfect peaceful location to chill the night before the big day!

From our first viewing to checking out the day after our wedding, the Sandon staff were attentive, friendly and helped us feel relaxed and looked after throughout an otherwise overwhelming process. We’d highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for a beautiful, peaceful and unique wedding venue!"
V129,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Thank you so much to the entire team for making our wedding so special! Thanks to Donique, MJ, Mo, Harry and everyone else for helping us organise our day and for their professional but friendly attitude. Merchant Taylors is such a beautiful venue and offers a brilliant layout and different spaces to make the day so special!"
V129,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you all so very much for such an amazing wedding on Saturday. You all worked tirelessly to make it so special. Everything was truly wonderful and you all did me proud! Both Hugh and I couldn’t have asked for anything more in terms of being so well looked after. Our guests were so impressed and have given us so many compliments on a brilliantly well run event. Thank you all again for playing a brilliant part in our truly wonderful day of which we loved every minute
V129,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you so much for the most wonderful wedding reception at the end of April. We had the perfect day and our guests all commented on how well looked after they has been. Thank you again for all your hard work!
V129,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"We know this is very late (we have no excuse), but we wanted to say thank you for everything you and the team at Merchant Taylor's did for us on our wedding day. All the guests have since told us how much they loved the venue, food and service. Fingers crossed you get a few couples getting in touch! Again, Thank You for everything!"
V129,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"My brother and I attended the wedding today, as Florist's for the wedding party.
We were treated fantastically well by ALL the staff that we met, nothing was too much trouble and they made our task a COMPLETE pleasure.
If this is how they treat the actual wedding party then you will have a unforgettable time. Many thanks to all the staff for helping us to do our job with ease ."
V129,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Zara,

Can we thank you and your team at Merchant Taylor’s Hall for all your hard work in making Caroline and Neil’s recent wedding so very special. You, in particular, were able to deal with every question and request in a really professional manner.

Merchant Taylors’ Hall is part of the rich panoply of history and tradition, which makes this great City. All of our guests, and in particular those from abroad, were totally spell bound by the atmosphere, the food and service.

James was superb in organising the whole operation. To turn the Great Hall from a wedding ceremony hall to a banqueting suite for 110 guests, including flowers, place settings and dance floor in ninety minutes was truly remarkable.

The food and wine was of an amazing standard, we know that Merchant Taylors’ Hall has a reputation for presenting some of the finest dining in the City of London. You certainly surpassed all expectations.

We have many wonderful memories of the 10th September 2016, but it is best summed up by our daughter Caroline, “Can we do it all over again?”."
V130,Garden Museum,I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate everything that you did to make our party such a success last Friday. It was brilliant being outside on such a lovely everning. Everyone was very impressed with the venue.
V130,Garden Museum,"Thank you for all your help, advice and on-the-day support, it really made our wedding very special and it certianly went off without a hitch! The Museum looked amazing and the garden was perfect, especially as the sunshine adn the guests wanted to make the most of the beautiful surroundings."
V131,Clearwell Castle,"Can’t tell you how wonderful the team were at Clearwell. Our wedding coordinator Phaedra was exceptional. Attention to detail and everyone of the team from front of house, waiting staff, groundsmen and the DJ made our day absolutely everything we dreamed of and unique to us.

Can’t recommend highly enough and cost was outstanding value for money.

So many our guest commented on the quality of the food and that it was the best wedding they had been too! The children loved the magic of the castle and opportunity to get outside and see the grounds.

The grooms family had a fabulous time staying in the cottages the night before and our guests at both the Castle & the Wyndham had a fabulous stay on the night of the wedding.

Wish we could do it all again!"
V131,Clearwell Castle,We had our wedding at Clearwell in June and we couldn’t recommend it highly enough. From start to finish everything was perfect and they went above and beyond to ensure we had an amazing day. I’d not hesitate in recommending them to any couples. Just a gorgeous place with staff that really care in making your day all that you hope it will be.
V131,Clearwell Castle,"From the moment we first visited Clearwell, we knew this was the venue for us. From the moment we started planning to the final touches on the day, all the staff were fantastic. Ann, our wedding coordinator, was a delight to work with throughout. Nothing was too much trouble and she kept us updated throughout. The day was tailored exactly to our needs and when we arrived at the venue on the day they had prepared everything perfectly.

We did the night before package which included rooms and food the evening before. We were supplied with so much food no one went hungry. The rooms in the Wyndham and the Castle are fantastically appointed.

The venue itself is gorgeous. The cellar bar downstairs adds a whole different dimension to the occasion where you can really let your hair down.

This was an absolute dream come true venue for us. We loved every single minute."
V131,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot fault this venue at all. We initially had to change our wedding date because of lockdown and they were so supportive and empathetic.
Ann, our coordinator, is quite possibly the loveliest person on the planet. She was always happy to answer any questions and it never felt like we were being a nuisances or asking a silly question.
On the morning of the wedding she was a lovely calm presence and the whole day just ran like clockwork.
The food was out of this world with many guests saying it was the best food they’d had at a wedding and one person actually thought we’d hired a Michellin Chef!
The venue is so so beautiful with plenty of space. The downstairs cellar was a great place to party the night away, it was like an exclusive nightclub. There were lots of quieter rooms for people who wanted some peace.
The DJ was brilliant, we forgot to give a list of songs we liked but he did a great job of guessing what we liked ( he must’ve looked at our age and figured nineties dance music was our era. And he was bang on the money)
I do not have a single complaint about this venue"
V131,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot speak highly enough about Clearwell Castle as a wedding venue. The venue itself is absolutely stunning. It rained on our wedding day but the indoor space was so vast and beautiful that ourselves and our guests still had the most amazing time! Our wedding co-ordinator, Phaedra, was absolutely incredible, both before and during the wedding. She was always so professional, replied to all of my emails (there were many) and answered all queries efficiently. On the day, we genuinely could not have managed without her. The day flowed so well with her guidance and it really helped me as the Bride as I felt I didn't need to worry about anything! All the other staff at Clearwell and at the Wyndham hotel were also so wonderful! Everyone worked so hard and every member of staff was so kind to us; it just made our day incredibly special and we are so appreciative to them all. The food was great, service very quick and all the guests really enjoyed it! We had so many compliments about the staff and venue! I honestly could not recommend Clearwell castle more as a wedding venue!"
V131,Clearwell Castle,"Our wedding on 10/11/23 was just the absolute perfect day from start to finish. Our wedding planner manager, Hannah, was incredible, not just on the day but throughout the whole planning process. She ensured everything ran smoothly on the day, sparing no details ensuring everything was just perfect and to time but without being stressful. She was very accommodating with the planning meetings working around both mine and my now Husband's shift patterns.
We both stayed the night before our wedding and the night of the wedding with many of our guests travelling a distance so also staying in the Wyndham which was very convenient. Staying in Keepers cottage with the Bridesmaids the night before added to the experience with the added feature of the hot tub, the groomsmen were very jealous. The beds were very comfortable and everyone was excited to stay in a castle.
On the day of the wedding, the staff were very accommodating moving the bridal party along to the bridal suite to finish preparations earlier than originally planned. The breakfast provided was the perfect amount for a busy morning getting ready. Everything, including the gardens, were immaculately kept adding to the WOW factor of getting married in a Castle.
The canapes served and welcome drinks were well received by the guests and ourselves whilst we had photographers prior to the wedding breakfast. The food was phenomenal and great portions and I was stuffed after. The staff were very accommodating for us with a lot of people with allergies, dislikes of mushrooms so adapting the menu for these individual people. We were even able to swap out a few bottles of wine included in our package for cocktails as us as the Bride and Groom did not drink wine.
As soon as we walked in the venue the first time, we knew it was the place we wanted to get married. Everytime we went back to view the venue again I fell more and more in love. For anyone thinking about viewing or even booking this incredible venue I would say do it! We will be going back for events in the future to relive the best day of our lives."
V131,Clearwell Castle,"We got married at Clearwell castle April 2023. What can I say it's the most perfect venue and we had the most amazing day. The organisation was amazing and the staff were great on the day and even leading up to the big day. Phaedra was our wedding planner and communication with her was great throughout and on our wedding day she ensured that it all ran smoothly. I cannot recommend Clearwell castle and their staff enough. Thank you again for helping us have our dream wedding.
Kind regards

Vanessa & David x"
V131,Clearwell Castle,"We had the most amazing wedding day on the 24th of November 2023, the whole day ran so smoothly and all our guests absolutely loved the venue. The food was amazing and our guests loved the fish and chip buffet in the evening! The whole progress of planning the wedding was so straight forward and Phedera was a great wedding manager."
V131,Clearwell Castle,"Clearwell Castle exceeded all our expectations for our wedding day. The moment we stepped onto the grounds, we were captivated by its timeless charm. The staff, especially Hannah, went above and beyond to make every detail perfect, ensuring a seamless and stress-free experience. The Ball Room, where we exchanged our vows, felt like something out of a storybook. The surrounding gardens provided a stunning backdrop for photos and added to the overall enchantment of the day. Our guests were equally impressed, and many commented on the unique and romantic atmosphere. Choosing Clearwell Castle was the best decision we made for our special day; it truly felt like a fairy-tale come to life."
V131,Clearwell Castle,"We had the perfect wedding at Clearwell Castle, their team were superb in providing planning assistance from the point of our booking, guidance on all aspects of our wedding choices from registrars and suppliers, and coordination on the day of the wedding to make sure it flowed seamlessly. It was a beautiful day, and we couldn't be happier with our choice of Wedding location."
V132,Inner Temple,We got married here in 2023. Everything was perfect and the team made sure the day/food etc was just as we wanted it. Particular thanks to Priya and Eva (Pegasus) for their hard work making our wedding day and lead up so special.
V133,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"I got married at Dodford Manor in February this year. A great time was had by all and I will be recommending the venue to any friends planning weddings.

The weather was bad on the day so we didn’t get to use the outside area very much, but it didn’t matter as the inside is so lovely.

Sky was really helpful and put me at ease on the day. Questions in the lead up and on the day were answered quickly and I was made to feel like the only bride in the world!"
V133,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford was the first venue we looked at shortly after we got engaged. The staff were friendly and relaxed when we had a tour, I knew it was the place for us! I think Lydia telling my now husband that we couldn’t have fireworks due to the animals nearby but we could have a fire performer outside, sold the deal for us! I got an amazing fire performer as a surprise for my husband and the guests after we had sparklers, and it just completed an amazing day!
We heard such positive things Dodford about how professional and smooth running weddings have been from our suppliers, and you guys didn’t disappoint. You handled the day so well, we didn’t worry about a thing and just enjoyed ourselves the whole day.
We honestly had so many lovely messages and conversations after our wedding about how the venue was amazing, everything and everyone was catered for, from my 88 year old Nan, to young children who could play and enjoy the outdoors with a scoop of amazing ice cream. We honestly couldn’t have asked for a better day, we would do it again in a heartbeat if we could! Thank you for making the day so seamless! We are eternally grateful to everyone at Dodford for making our dreams come true becoming Mr and Mrs Price!"
V133,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford Manor what an incredible venue, from initial enquiry to booking, Dodford and the staff were so accommodating and well organised. Nothing was ever too much trouble, even if emails were being sent at 11pm. The day itself, wow it was absolutely incredible, as our wedding was on a budget and due to small numbers Dodford were amazing at setting out our decorations, everything was absolutely perfect and a special shout out to Kayleigh who was amazing on our wedding day. She kept us on time, always checking we were okay and just such a lovely person and really made our day perfect. Would highly recommend a Dodford to any couple due to be married they make the planning and the day an absolute dream and we want to relive it over again."
V133,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"It goes without saying that Dodford is a fab venue.... stunning set up, well maintained, clean, perfect grounds etc... but the best thing about Dodford is the team! I had super high expectations of any wedding venue I booked as I used to run a wedding venue myself (potential nightmare client 😂).... from the 1st viewing the team were fantastic. Relaxed, stress free, organised, professional, knowledgeable, flexible but mostly importantly friendly which gave me complete confidence in them delivering my perfect day.
In the run up to the big day the team are super responsive on email and phone We didn't meet our Event Manager, Lydia, until the day but I was always confident that they work as a whole team and therefore having 1 point of contact was not necessary at all.
In the day Lydia was amazing! Still relaxed and professional and the whole day ran so smoothly. Every requirement was perfect, on time, delivered exceptionally.
We had the best day, thank you to the whole team (especially Lydia!)
Vic & Tony

V133,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We honestly can’t say thank you enough for how amazing Dodford Manor Barn was, along with all the incredible staff who helped make our day truly unforgettable.

From the moment we visited, we fell in love with the beautiful landscapes, open-plan barns, and stunning large windows that flooded the space with natural light. The venue package was one of the best we saw during our search—it felt like everything we could possibly need was covered.

The team at Dodford Manor Barn were incredibly friendly and supportive throughout the entire planning process. Communication was open and consistent, which made everything feel so much more manageable and stress-free. We were even able to find all of our wonderful vendors through Dodford Manor Barn, which was a huge bonus!

As a bride who suffers from anxiety, I was unwell on the morning of the wedding. But I have to give special thanks to Kayleigh and our vendors, who were absolutely amazing and supported me through every step—they helped me feel calm, cared for, and ready to enjoy the day.

Our guests couldn’t stop talking about how stunning the venue was and how lovely the food turned out. We were also lucky enough to have sunshine all day, topped off with a beautiful sunset in the evening—it truly felt magical.

Thank you again, Dodford Manor Barn, for being such a perfect place to start our next chapter.

With love,
Carter & Emmie (24.03.2025) x"
V133,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"From the moment we booked our wedding at Dodford Manor, we knew we were in good hands—but nothing could have prepared us for just how extraordinary the experience would be. Every single detail was handled with such precision, care, and genuine warmth that it truly felt like a dream come to life.

The venue itself is breathtaking, but what made our day unforgettable was the impeccable service. The entire team operated like a well-oiled machine, making sure everything ran smoothly while keeping the atmosphere joyful and stress-free. Their attention to detail was second to none—no request was too big or too small.

We want to give a heartfelt, special shoutout to *Lydia*, our incredible Wedding Manager. From our first meeting to the final dance, she was nothing short of amazing. Lydia went above and beyond at every turn—anticipating needs before we even voiced them, coordinating flawlessly with suppliers, and offering support with a calming confidence that put us completely at ease, (apart from making me cry the second I saw her! 😂). Her passion for what she does shone through in every interaction, and our day would not have been the same without her.

Thanks to this amazing venue and its phenomenal team (especially Lydia!), we were able to truly enjoy every moment of our wedding, knowing everything was in the best possible hands. If you're considering this venue for your big day—don’t hesitate. It’s everything you hope for, and more.

We want to do it over and over!
A day we will NEVER forget!!

Thank you again and all our Love,
Mr & Mr Pargeter-Prince

V133,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We booked Dodford Manor in Feb 2024 after we viewed the space, for our wedding in March 2025. It was the only venue we viewed, but instantly fell in love with the character and variety of spaces the venue had to offer. The free corkage also really appealed to us as a great way for us to bring our own drinks at a good cost.

From start to end, the team were amazing, helping us with the planning of the day and making sure we had a great array of suppliers we could work with. The live band was a huge part of our day, and Dodford have a great mixture of acts on their supplier list.

On the day of the wedding, the groomsmen arrived at the venue to help with set up to see that our amazing event manager, Kayleigh had every single aspect of the day in hand and sorted. She sorted all table settings, decor, stationary - Everything!! Nothing was too much to ask of her and the Dodford team. The day ran impeccably well, with everything being on time and everything we asked for being sorted. Our drinks were served chilled, on time and were always around. It’s easy for venues who offer free corkage to try and limit you drinking your own drink - Not here!! There was constantly beers being topped up, wine bottles replaced and aperol spritz being taken round. Cannot fault them!

The team packed all of our bits away and ready for us to collect the next morning. We are very aware Dodford is a busy venue and wanted to make sure we wasn’t just “another wedding” but at no point was that the case. We felt like we were the one and only wedding and genuinely could not ask for more!

Thank you so so much for everything, Highly recommended!!"
V133,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We got married her a month ago today and had the most amazing day with them. Jess, Jack and the team made sure that everything ran smoothly and that they were doing everything they could for us on the day. We would 100% recommend them for anyone wishing to marry in such a beautiful setting."
V133,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We had been apprehensive booking Dodford for our reception that it was so popular in Northamptonshire that our wedding could end up looking the same as a lot of others we knew of, as we're local - but that was a ridiculous thing to worry about! The level of flexibility/customisation you get with Dodford is unmatched in our opinion; as it's such a beautiful venue to start with, you don't have to work hard to make it look good before adding in your personality as a couple!

The whole process from enquiries to final planning and the execution on the day were great. We did have a slight issue with them not inviting us to a food tasting in enough time before our wedding date (whether they forgot/we were missed off a list we don't know) but when we did raise it they invited us to a tasting at their sister venue instead (it's 2 hours away but we were available to travel thankfully). Every member of staff we encountered in our experience with Dodford were so friendly and make you feel like you are the only couple that matters for them in that moment, which we really appreciated from such a popular/busy venue. Abbie was our Event Manager on the day and provided such an elevated level of service, nothing was too much trouble and she executed our plans/vision to a tee, adding in some extra details that we loved too.

Our wedding was in December 2024, and we only had our reception at Dodford, so the ceremony barn was set up for our drinks reception with plenty of space for guests without it feeling cramped or equally like we were all rattling around in there (we had 75 guests for our reception). They don't have many photos of indoor drinks receptions in their promo so I was a little worried how it would look but the team had it set up beautifully. We also had a brass band on the mezzanine level which was really fun and festive!

What sold Dodford for us was the no daytime corkage, which meant we could really personalise our drinks reception and wedding breakfast drinks without breaking the bank. There was a slight disconnect with how and when we had requested/planned to serve some of the drinks in our planning meeting and what happened on the day, which we think may have been a slight hiccup in communication between Dodford and Jenkinsons (the caterers), but it didn't have a negative impact on our day at all!

Overall, there's a reason this is such a popular venue - it is truly perfect!"
V133,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,Dodford manor is an amazing wedding venue. From the very beginning when we first stepped into the venue to look around we fell in love. We knew we had to have our wedding there. After booking the venue we had amazing contact with the staff from booking our food tasting session. To a general email to see how our wedding planning was going. The planning meeting was well organised and we were able to talk through exactly what we wanted and no want was too big for the team.
V134,Gosfield Hall,"I never imagined my wedding would be somewhere as stunning as Gosfield hall but from the minute we saw this venue we knew it was the one for us and didn't bother viewing anymore venues as we had already made our minds up about having our wedding here! We were absolutely blown away with the natural beauty of Gosfield hall and so booked two years in advance of our wedding day! The professionalism and advice we received from Linda was super helpful and informative on the run up to our wedding as there is soo much to think about! We loved that we could have our day and evening all in one place aswell as the option weather permitting to have our wedding ceremony outside. I'm pleased to say the weather was absolutely perfect on our wedding day and we got to have our fairytale wedding outside! The package we paid for was well worth the money! Our guests were absolutely spoilt on our day and have all said it was the best wedding they've ever been too! It was amazing to have our guests stay over aswell! Jocie our wedding planner was absolutely amazing! She was sooo friendly and super accommodating and went above and beyond on our day to make it absolutely perfect with no hiccups! She even helped dress me on the day as she knew how to do up a corset dress and my mother didn't have a clue lol she made all my wedding details and decorations come to life and done such a stunning job decorating our dream venue aswell as being super supportive towards me my family and guests! The honeymoon suite is the best we've ever seen and completely took ours and our guests breaths away! Mind blowing! The food,venue,grounds,accomodation and night before accomodation were absolutely stunning and we want to thank everyone at Gosfield hall for making our day soo incredible and special and a day we and our guests will never forget! We can't wait to return to Gosfield! Thank you everyone at Gosfield what an amazing place!"
V134,Gosfield Hall,"We had previously experienced Gosfield Hall as a guest before deciding on it for our anniversary.

Our day was beautiful and went according to plan. Our guests all had great feedback about the day.

The only thing we would have changed would have been more diverse menu for the main meals."
V134,Gosfield Hall,"Gosfield hall is a beautiful location for a wedding and their packages cover all the important stuff! We didn’t have to worry about caterers, wedding coordinator or a DJ - all included! Great service, lovely food and everyone really enjoyed the day! Our coordinator Jocie was fab on the day, getting everything organised and fetching anything we needed. Couldn’t have asked for better, she knew the time line and the day flowed really smoothly!"
V134,Gosfield Hall,"We got married at Gosfield Hall and everything about it was perfect from when we arrive to view it, booking, the communication and Faye Carter our wedding Coordinator! If you want the best wedding day with no hassle, Gosfield is your place!!"
V134,Gosfield Hall,"Myself and my Wife have just got married at Gosfield Hall,
Our expensive started when we viewed the venue and we first met Linda sales manager, she welcome us in & made us feel at home, we wasn’t sure how, but she made us feel calm like this was where we was meant to be.
Once we looked around at all the venue has to offer we had already made a decision as this is such a stunning location and instantly new this was what we wanted! It was just right for us.

We did not get made to feel pressured to make any decisions immediately however we did end up booking our big say within the next few days after our visit.

Our next contact was with Ellie our wedding planner, she was very helpful and nothing was ever to much, we enjoyed the food tasting at the venue and was very impressed with the experience, it was out of this world.
Ellie helped us through all of our problems and made sure all of our plans come to life.

Now on our big day, what can I say? The staff were amazing, Ellie couldn’t have done enough every time you wanted to ask a question she was next to us any time we needed something. She was there all the way through the day/ night & even the next morning, Ellie made our day Run seamlessly.
We’ve been to many weddings before but never have we had food as amazing as we did here.
Every guest was amazed at the food quality and commented on how delicious it was!
Just to sum up if you’re thinking about booking your wedding at Gosfield Hall don’t question it just book it. You will be amazed."
V134,Gosfield Hall,"The venue is stunning and was the perfect setting for our winter wedding (so much natural light even in January). Jocie Golbourn was our assigned wedding planning specialist and she is so kind, sweet, patient and professional. All our guests loved the venue but many actually commented on how flawless and seamless the day was organised and rooms decorated and prepared from each section of the wedding and we only have Jocie and venue staff to thank for their meticulous planning and preparations. The food and drinks were delicious. Couldn’t recommend this venue enough- we actually booked the venue on a whim and were SO happy when we visited for an open day. There’s no false advertisements- it’s stunning."
V134,Gosfield Hall,"Everything, from start to finish, was exactly what we wanted and more. The preparation was helped by our wonderful personal manager, Tara, and accommodated each and every one of our requests and needs. The venue is gorgeous, food delicious, and atmosphere felt special. Our friends and family all told us that this was such a spectacular wedding for them that it was the best they've ever been to. We felt completely taken care of, kept us calm and happy throughout the day, and kept all of our suppliers in place and to standard. It felt glamourous and unique. We wish we could relive the day over and over. It really was our dream wedding."
V134,Gosfield Hall,"We got married in Gosfield Hall in May and had the most amazing wedding day that any couple could ask for. The whole experience from the arrival the night before to leaving the day after was seamlessly managed by the team at the venue.
The house and the grounds looked absolutely stunning and Ellie and the team did a brilliant job at keeping the day running smoothly without making anyone feel rushed. Everyone there was immensely friendly and helpful and we really felt that everyone who worked there was invested in making our day feel special.
We fell in love with the venue when we booked it but the whole experience exceeded out expectations so much that we wish we could do it all again!"
V134,Gosfield Hall,"I wanted to take a moment to commend and state our appreciation for Jocie. She truly was phenomenal, approachable and no task was too big.
We had 5 months to plan our wedding and we loved every moment. With us both working in the service industry it was great to have someone who was so switched on and would be an asset to have on any team."
V134,Gosfield Hall,"Having just got married at Gosfield Hall I can honestly say it was the most beautiful venue and the most perfect day. The staff were so attentive and professional. The food was outstanding and the drinks and cocktails were fabulous. They couldn’t do enough to make sure our day was everything we’d dreamt of. I have to say a special thanks to Ellie - one of the wedding coordinators on site - she went above and beyond to help us plan our day and was there from the very moment I woke up delivering fresh pastries for breakfast to the moment she made me a cup of tea to go to bed with. I can’t thank you enough Ellie, you are an absolute credit to Gosfield Hall."
V135,Kingston Estate Totnes,"When I first enquired with Kingston I thought it would be too expensive but we explained what are budget was and when we wanted to get married and they put a quote together that was affordable.
We have just had the most amazing one day wedding which didn't finish until the early hours. We got married in the Long Barn where there are chandeliers running down the middle, it was very romantic. There is this nightclub at Kingston which is very cool which everyone loved. The guests all said the venue was stunning and the food was out of this world.
A few of us stayed the night before and most of our guests stayed the night of the wedding in the cottages and barns. The staff were brilliant and they coordinated the whole day for us. I cant recommend the venue enough."
V135,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had a two day wedding at the Kingston Estate. All our guests were completely blown away by it.
Most of our friends and family had traveled far for the weekend and were not disappointed when then arrived as the cottages and barns are gorgeous. Some even have hot tubs.
Jodie and the Weddings Team organised a welcome party for the first night which was unreal along with providing street style food for everyone around 8.30 pm. At Kingston they have this really cool enormous Yurt and food hut which is used the day before the wedding and for breakfast.
On the wedding day itself we got married in the Walled Garden and there were endless canapes during the drinks reception. We then decided to eat in the Hayloft Barn which has glass windows overlooking all the gardens.
We used the clear span marquee for our reception party and had the craziest cover band before we all went into the nightclub until 3 am. The good thing about Kingston is everything is included they let you use things like cake stands, easels, knifes, speakers, microphones, all furniture at no extra cost, they set everything up for you and then clean up afterwards. We didn]t have to do anything which made everything totally stress free.

Thank you Jodie, Ellie and Charlotte it was insane !!"
V135,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had the most magical wedding at Kingston. From the moment we set foot onto the grounds, we knew it was the perfect place for our special day. It was our first viewing… and nothing else compared for us (we saw a total of 6 venues). What stood out to us the most was the variety of spaces available for each part of the day. The selection of ceremony areas, the beautiful outdoor spots for photos, the yurt for the night before party, and a special one for us… the underground nightclub for the evening! As party lovers, this was a part that sold it for us; there was somewhere for every moment.

One of the things we loved most was the flexibility to personalize every aspect of our wedding. The venue truly felt like a blank canvas that we could transform into our dream setting, but equally, we got away with doing absolutely nothing as it was beautiful all on its own.

But what truly made our experience unforgettable was the incredible staff, led by Jodie. They were not only professional and attentive but also genuinely warm and welcoming. Their support and attention to detail ensured that everything ran smoothly, allowing us to relax and fully enjoy our day.

We're hoping to return and stay in the future, for a special occasion.

It's not just a wedding venue; it's a place that holds a special spot in our hearts as the backdrop to the beginning of our happily ever after 🤍"
V135,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Kingston was perfect. Despite a rainy start, the day was amazing and Jodie was available but subtly in the background allowing the day to be ours."
V135,Kingston Estate Totnes,"After over a two and a half year wait due to Covid, our son and his wife had a wonderful wedding weekend. Jodie from Kingston Estate and her team of staff went above and beyond to ensure the wedding ran smoothly. Every detail was dealt with professionally. The accommodation, venue and food were all excellent and all our guests many from overseas had a wonderful time. The only thing Jodie could not oversee was the weather but even a little rain didn't spoil the celebrations."
V135,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue and staff were brilliant from start to finish. The venue is really multi-functional and caters for rain or shine. The weather was really unpredictable around the time of our wedding but I was a stress free bride knowing they had it in hand. The food supplier was stunning - we had a weekend package which all the guests raved about. That coupled with the unlimited drinks pages made it the perfect venue for us. A Devon treasure that feels like being on a film set - everyone loved it!
V135,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Such a beautiful venue - we loved it so much. The food was incredible and despite having a changeover of wedding planner close to the wedding day, it had no impact on our day what so ever. The venue are calm and professional and loved their approach to communication which was friendly."
V135,Kingston Estate Totnes,Fell in love with the venue on our first visit. We were particularly looking for a venue which could cater us for 3 days and sleep the majority of the the guests. The grounds were well kept especially the walled garden which is where the ceremony took place. The team were a pleasure and made the day truly special.
V135,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Our 3-day wedding celebrations were spent at the STUNNING Kingston Estate - a truly unique venue that we absolutely fell in love with. It had EVERYTHING we were looking for & more. The grounds are perfectly manicured all year round & come complete with walled garden. The cottages & main house are beautifully decorated, providing luxurious accommodation for 86 of our guests. Sarah & the team were such a pleasure to work with & couldn’t do enough for us. The catering was also top notch. Thank you"
V135,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue was great we had a few personal health issues beforehand but the team went above and beyond to make the day extra special. The wedding planner organised everything for us and they had plenty of props on site that we were free to use. We had the whole place to ourselves for the weekend it was brilliant and our friends loved the hot tub and pool.
V136,Holmewood Hall,"We were married at Holmewood Hall on 15th February 2025 and I can honestly say that it was the most magical day. We went to visit the venue and instantly fell in love with it but even we were blown away by how beautiful everything looked on the day. All of the staff were amazing - special shoutout to our personal wedding manager, Laura Pike, who was always on hand to answer any questions - she couldn’t do enough for us! The food was wonderful & we had full control over the menu. Would highly recommend this venue, you won’t regret it!"
V136,Holmewood Hall,"Holmewood Hall was an absolutely perfect wedding venue. The house is stunning, well cared for and beautifully decorated. All of the staff are so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Our Wedding Coordinator was fantastic, available from early morning of the wedding and was still there the morning after working for us. The food was excellent, drinks and canapes were amazing and the venue took care of everything for us. We had the most perfect wedding and are so pleased we chose Holmewood Hall. The Gold Room where we had our ceremony is gorgeous. Thank you for giving us a beautiful wedding!"
V136,Holmewood Hall,"I cannot fault this venue at all, the venue itself is breathtakingly beautiful with magnificent rooms and very lovingly maintained grounds. The staff are incredibly friendly, professional and efficient, our wedding coordinator Lee was a pleasure to work with and made our special day run smoothly. If you want a hassle free wedding with breathtaking grounds and the most amazing staff then this is the venue for you."
V136,Holmewood Hall,"Had the most amazing wedding here recently and cannot recommend it enough.

The venue itself is stunning and the options included in the luxe package covered everything we could've possibly wanted and made planning the wedding 100x less stressful.

The staff were all amazing from start to finish, Katie showed us around initially and then Lee was our personal wedding manager, and they were both incredible throughout. Always on hand to answer any questions and help us through the day once we got there.
We had so many comments from our guests on how lovely the staff were on the day!

A particular highlight though was the food - the tasting evening was a dream and the chef went above and beyond to provide a full vegan menu for us which wasn't limited to only a couple of options.
Again, we had so many non-vegan guests complimenting the food and saying how lovely it was!

Overall, an incredible day and an incredible venue.
Thank you so much to everyone there!"
V136,Holmewood Hall,"This place is simply just amazing 🤩
We had our wedding here on 17-12-24 and it was everything we dreamed of and more. The food, staff, decor were just perfect not forgetting the most beautiful Christmas tree 😍
Our person wedding planner Lee was an absolute god send not just having him there on the day but always being at the end of a phone to answer any questions or worry’s.
If we could go back and do it all again we would and not change a single thing.
The most perfect day at the most perfect venue ♥️"
V136,Holmewood Hall,Perfect venue for a wedding with guest numbers 60 - 100. Our guests and I moved from each room to a new room throughout the day and every room had a new surprise. The bridal suite was lush and it was great having all our guests staying under one roof. I would 100% recommend this to anyone.
V136,Holmewood Hall,"The wedding day and lead up to the day were fab. However, for the price we paid, we expected a little bit more.
I opted to use the bridal cottage the evening before for which we paid £450 extra. This is something I now regret, as there was no hot water and we were not able to order any food in as all the take away options were shut (on a Friday night). The hot tub also needed a good clean. So the night before/morning of my wedding was not ideal. I flagged this to the manager who advised that we should have raised the cold water issue as soon as possible, but seeing as we were trying to have morning showers on the wedding day, this did not leave us any time.
Our package included pre-drinks, wine with dinner and we also purchased a cocktail ""cart"" (cocktails on a table) and a bucket of beers. The groom, who is not a wine fan, asked for a beer with his wedding meal and was presented with a contactless card machine to pay for it at the top table. We felt this was a bit unnecessary as there was a full bucket of extra beers outside and it felt a little embarrassing having a card machine presented to us at the top table on our wedding day for one measly Corona, despite the huge amount we had paid. Also, guests were unknowingly allowed to buy beers from the bar after the meal, despite there being available beers to them already in a bucket next to the bar...
Overall the wedding was lovely, but for the price we paid we expected a bit better. Essentially, I loved the venue, but I wish we had not purchased any extras!"
V136,Holmewood Hall,"We got married at Holmewood Hall on 4th October 2024. From the first moment we stepped into the venue and I saw the magnificent Gold room I knew this would be the perfect place for us to get married. We had the most amazing day which was perfectly coordinated by the whole team at Holmewood but especially so by our personal wedding manager Lee. Lee was always quick to respond to any questions we had in the lead up to the day and nothing was too much trouble for him.
We honestly wish we could do it all over again as it was a magical day. We would recommend Holmewood Hall to anyone looking for the perfect venue."
V136,Holmewood Hall,"After getting engaged in late March this year we wanted to get married fairly quickly so booked Holmewood for the same September. The venue, grounds, accomodation were all stunning and we felt very fortunate it was within budget and the package we got was outstanding in comparison to other venues and what it included, which was far far more than other venues. We got to attend a luxe event to choose all our wedding food, canapés, cocktails and wines which should have made things easier but due to the unbelievable quality it made it harder! Our wedding planner Lee is literally the most fantastic person. He was flexible, fun, engaged and on absolutely everything. The day was ran impeccably and also smooth even with some weather concerns and speeches taking a bit longe than we thought. If you book here ask for Lee!! We had the most perfect day. Can’t fault a single things. Our guests all told us how incredible everything was with one even saying he will now longer not attend any further weddings unless it’s at Holmewood. Thank you to all the staff and as mentioned a huge special thank you to Lee! Your a legend!"
V136,Holmewood Hall,"Exceptional venue, stunning grounds, fantastic DJ, and excellent service. Highly recommended! Happiest day of my life 😊"
V137,Bourton Hall,"We got married at Bourton Hall on 08 March 2025 and our wedding planner was Harminder. The day was absolutely amazing from start to finish. All the food and drinks were of a high standard and presented beautifully which includes the wedding breakfast, canapés and cocktails, and breakfast the next day. The venue is gorgeous with lots of rooms, well maintained grounds and exclusive use. The staff are friendly and accommodating and the event was really well managed. We would like to particularly thank Harminder, who was supportive throughout the wedding planning process and the wedding day, ensuring things ran smoothly and in a timely manner. He is a great communicator, provided advice and guidance where needed and attention to detail. We really had a magical day! Thank you so much! We would happily do it all over again and would definitely recommend this venue!"
V137,Bourton Hall,"What a fabulous wedding venue! Because it's a wedding venue and not a hotel that holds the occasional wedding, they really focused on what was important and anticipated our every need. It's an elegant venue but with a comfortable feel to it. The team are incredibly accommodating and helpful and each couple is allocated their own personal wedding manager to guide them through the process and to make sure every detail is covered.
There's a beautiful chapel on site where non-religious ceremonies can be held - this was fabulous.
The food was plentiful and delicious - all our guests raved about it. Great choice of welcome drinks and canapes, wines and cocktails.
The grounds are gorgeous; a perfect backdrop for our October wedding.
The venue was exclusively ours and has beautiful bedrooms, including a huge, stunning bridal suite. Most of our guests stayed overnight and took advantage of the brilliant breakfast in the morning so it really extended the celebration."
V137,Bourton Hall,"Our wedding at Bourton Hall was better than we ever imagined. The Italianate mansion is truly spectacular inside and out however it is the team that made our day run perfectly. Our guests found the setting and the food incredible, they were very impressed! Our wedding planner Emily Sarjant was fantastic her knowledge and expertise made our day magical from start to finish, with all the special touches that she suggested. Our first dance was created in such a beautiful way it will be a memory we cherish forever. Thank you to Emily and the team at Bourton Hall. My husband would also like to note that the croquembouche was amazing and everyone should have one."
V137,Bourton Hall,"My wife and I got married at Bourton Hall in September, with our wedding managed by the wonderful Eleni. Everything about the day went as perfectly as we could've wished, right from arrival to departure the following day. The venue is stunning, and the food was lovely, and having 21 bedrooms on site was such a bonus so that all of our close friends and family could stay on site with us.
Bourton Hall did everything they could both in the run up to the day and on the day itself to alleviate all stress to ensure everything ran as seamlessly as possible, which it absolutely did.
We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall enough."
V137,Bourton Hall,"We were married on 28th July 2024. What an amazing day we had at Bourton Hall. Could not fault it! The venue is so elegant! The grounds and views were to die for. The food was out of this world with so many choices and all cooked and served to perfection. Accommodation / rooms were plentiful and luxurious. Lovely to have a chapel on site too. We had the whole place to ourselves, we felt like royalty! Lots of varied rooms and areas for people to choose where they wanted to be after the wedding breakfast. We would choose the venue all over again!"
V137,Bourton Hall,"We had both our wedding ceremony and reception at Bourton Hall and the service was superb throughout. The house and grounds are beautiful with amazing views to go with them. The staff were professional and helpful during the lead up to our wedding day and during the day as well - even when we had an emergency prior to the ceremony which caused delays, the venue staff were able to work around this to move timings back in order to allow all of our planned activities to go ahead and be fully enjoyed. All the food was delicious and we had a wonderful wedding day thanks to Bourton Hall."
V137,Bourton Hall,"We had the most perfect wedding day at Bourton Hall. Throughout the planning process and on the day, the team were so professional, which meant we could relax and know that everything was in their capable hands - Emily was an amazing wedding manager. The building is beautiful inside and out, and the grounds are stunning - there are so many places for beautiful photos, and views out over the countryside. The food was absolutely delicious, it was so hard to choose what to have! It was also so helpful to have so many places for guests to sit and chat in the evening, away from the disco room but still part of the action. Having so many bedrooms onsite (not to mention a stunning bridal suite!) was an added bonus. We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall highly enough, and have had so many comments from guests saying what a beautiful, elegant but relaxed day it was, so I know they really appreciated everything Bourton has to offer too. Thank you so much to Emily and the whole team for giving us such a perfect day!"
V137,Bourton Hall,"As the Bride and Groom we were made to feel like nothing was too much to ask and they couldn't do enough to make us feel special.
All the guests commented that it was one of the prettiest and most relaxed weddings they have been to.
We could not have asked for a better wedding day thanks to Bourton!"
V137,Bourton Hall,"I had my wedding on 10/02/2024 I am so happy I chose this venue, It is really magical. My wedding manager was just the best! Emily went above and beyond to help me on my big day! I cannot thank her enough.

One of the main things about this venue is that t has its own chappel which is really special and makes you wedding seem more traditional, however there are more options/ rooms available. I wanted the wow factor and I got it.

Some of the options that made it great

*Onsite accommodation for night before and night of the wedding is really helpful
*Exclusive use
*Dedicated wedding manager definate gamechanger! (Emily)
*Menu choices are fantastic.

Everyone commented on the food being really nice ( we had the lamb) The evening buffet was also great. I paid extra to have a meal created as having part of my culture within the food at the wedding was very important to me, they did not disappoint.
Emily was perfect in so many ways, she knew exactly my vision once i explained it to her and she made sure that it became real for me. She adapted parts of the day so that it would work better, for example bringing the canapes outside whilst photos where being taken. Helping me into my dress, looking after my phone just everything I needed she was there. She really worked hard to make sure it run perfectly and it did.

Thank you emily!!! You made my day Great."
V137,Bourton Hall,We got married at Bourton Hall on 30th July 2023. It was the most amazing day ever! We are still receiving compliments from our guests on how stunning the venue was and the whole running of the day. This was 100% down to our wedding co-ordinator Harminder. He went above and beyond to ensure our day was absolutely perfect. He literally could not have done any more! Thank you again Harminder!!
V138,B&H Buildings,Bourne & Hollingsworth was such an exceptional venue for our wedding this September. This is the perfect place for you if you want a true London wedding that feels like a fun dinner/house party but on an epic scale. We used the top floor (the studios) for our sit down dinner (think candle light and tasty roast lamb) and headed downstairs for our reception with the basement club (below and hidden) for late night dancing. The place is stunning (greenery and glass everywhere and the cocktails are insane but what really makes this place are the people. The whole staff from Matt and Lizzie to the bar team to the dinner crew made our whole day seamless and so fun. Could not recommend B&H more highly for your London wedding.
V138,B&H Buildings,"Beautiful wedding celebration in the most stylish venue - we had an intimate wedding reception (drinks, dinner and more drinks!) at the Bourne & Hollingsworth Buildings. The staff members on duty were excellent - nothing was too much trouble and they served everyone with such professionalism. We couldn’t recommend it highly enough and we haven’t stopped talking about it since. All of our guests were so impressed with the space and how stylish it was. The bar, restaurant and greenhouse are all aesthetically beautiful and the botanical vibes make for a very relaxed, but premium setting. Special shout out to Lizzie who helped us coordinate everything and Matt on the day who led the team. Thank you so much - we had the best day and we couldn’t have wished to host it in a better venue."
V138,B&H Buildings,"India & the B&H team were seamless. Flexible, responsive, kind, and easy to deal with. They made our day so special. The food was fantastic, the drinks were lovely, and the value for money was first rate!"
V139,Leez Priory,"I never in my life thought I would get married in a place like Leez priory! The whole experience from start to finish was just fantastic. The price breakdown was manageable and there was no pressure to take any upgrades offered. The things we got in our package were phenomenal and having a wedding planner was tremendous - our lady (Leanne) was an absolute god send!
They catered to all our needs and we were made to feel so comfortable and nothing was a problem! I’d highly suggest going to an event there before hand, just to get a feel of what it’s like full of people and enjoy their delicious food. We actually enjoyed their entertainer ( singer) so much we hired him for our wedding ☺️
Lee priory is just so beautiful. I can’t speak highly enough x"
V139,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory on the 7th of September 2024. Considering how long they have been a wedding venue, they were pretty flexible with some of the ideas we had for the venue styling that turned out amazingly!

The staff really made the day something special and couldn't have done enough for us. Special mention must be made for Leanne, our wedding planner, who was amazing!

Highly recommend the venue and the incredible team that helped to make our day so special!"
V139,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in October 2024. This venue is stunning both inside and out with immaculately kept grounds and interior. The hospitality in the lead up to and on the day of the wedding was fantastic. The food was also brilliant. Another great perk of this venue is the amount of on site accommodation.

A couple of drawbacks / experiences during our wedding. There are only a few toilets in the main building which kept blocking and overflowing throughout the evening which led to us taking some guests to the dressing room or honeymoon cottage to use the facilities. You are also restricted by the venue on any external food or drink suppliers and the venues optional extras for this are quite expensive for what they are.

That asaide, we had the best day and evening at Leez Priory and would certainly recommend it!"
V139,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in August 2024- great venue and experience from initial viewing to leaving the morning after the wedding. Leanne acted as our wedding planner and was friendly, professional and helpful throughout. We opted for the classic package and the food was amazing quality with everyone commenting how full they were!
The venue is beautiful with several options for ceremony both inside and out. Accommodation was great too. The whole day ran smoothly with perfect weather - we will have very happy memories of our day!"
V139,Leez Priory,"Perfect venue and very attentive staff, lovely food and great communication from start to finish"
V139,Leez Priory,"Stunning venue. Fantastic Team. Very accommodating toward our unique ""surprise"" strategy. Our guests were truly surprised. Thank you."
V139,Leez Priory,"Leez priory was the 1st and only venue we looked around when we started planning our wedding. From the moment we stepped on the premises, everything just looked so perfect and exactly what we wanted from a wedding venue. When we got assigned our wedding co-ordinator Rachel, she was just absolutely spot on with everything we asked for and nothing was too big an ask for her. She made sure the day ran as smoothly as possible and took care of any issue that arose without me knowing (which I am forever grateful for!!)
The rest of the staff were amazing and very helpful.

The venue itself is just absolutely stunning and we loved that it has the pub area as well as the dance floor so it catered to all of our guests.

All of the rooms were lovely and it was so nice being able to stay in the fisherman’s lodge onsite the night before the wedding.

We genuinely cannot recommend this venue enough and it was 100% worth the money! 10/10!"
V139,Leez Priory,"We got married on a Tuesday in October to maximise the value of what we could get for our money; and honestly, we got everything we wanted and more. Leanne, our Wedding Manager was perfect at bringing an attention to detail and seamless organisation to the big day, and in the lead up. There wasn't one moment of the day where we felt stressed, as Leanne had it covered. In one particular instance, our flowers for the bridal party's hair hadn't arrived. Within five minutes of telling Leanne that we needed this, the flowers were with our hair and make-up suppliers to add the finishing touches.

Leez Priory as a venue is the most stunning setting, and offers an incredible range of areas in which the ceremony and reception can take place. There is also the opportunity for the bridal party to make use of the Fisherman's Cottage the night before the wedding, and for people to stay in the on-site accommodation on the evening of the wedding, making it the perfect venue for people also travelling from further afield.

Leez Priory were very accommodating, welcoming and were happy to work with us to make our day as perfect as possible. The food was incredible, and a total hit with all of our guests, and so many people have commented on how incredible the day was as a whole. You wouldn't be disappointed to choose Leez Priory."
V139,Leez Priory,They catered to our every need. To when we would ask for things they hadn’t been done before they still made sure it went smoothly. Leanne was amazing she made me feel so comfortable from the start. The whole day was stunning. Beautiful venue please go view it as you will not be disappointed
V139,Leez Priory,We got married on the 26 May 2024. This venue was absolutely brilliant! They catered for every need and made sure there was no stress on the day. Leanne was kind and level headed throughout and was always one step ahead! Do not hesitate to book- do it now!
V140,London Rowing Club,"We picked this place because we wanted somewhere fairly central and casual. We fell in love with the long room and the view. Our wedding was in October so we thought we'd have it cosy but we ended up with a beautiful autumnal day so everyone was on the balcony. The fairy lights were perfect and the other rooms were great to avoid leaving. The staff was so friendly and accommodating that we would definitely recommend the venue.

The only thing that could have tainted the day is that after three visits and many emails, we were never told that the river floods (a lot). We were flexible with our day so if we knew this we would have built it into our day, instead, I was told by the photographer on the day as I got out of the taxi that we wouldn't be able to take any group photos because the area would be flooded during the cocktail hour and half that we had assigned as photo time. This would have been disappointing but we all ended up running outside after the ceremony to take photos before the tide came in. My husband and I borrowed wellies for our couple photos. We had fun doing this, but I can imagine many couples being upset! My friend's electric car also flooded and they were obviously upset."
V140,London Rowing Club,"Annabel was meticulous in her help planning the wedding. Very knowledgeable and helpful.
On the day the rest of the staff were brilliant - there wasn’t an empty glass in the house.
Great venue at a reasonable price on the London riverside."
V140,London Rowing Club,"LRC was the perfect place to celebrate our wedding this summer. The venue staff went above and beyond to ensure that everything went as planned both before and during the event. Thanks in particular to Annabel who was responsive, helpful and always put us at ease in the build up. The location is stunning - couldn’t have asked for a better day!"
V140,London Rowing Club,"We just wanted to say an enormous thank you for everything. From the moment we came to visit the LRC on a slightly grey January weekend, we knew it would be a fabulous venue for our June wedding reception and it certainly did not disappoint. It really is the most beautiful setting and we have very fond memories of our guests enjoying drinks in the sunshine with the most fantastic view over the Thames. The venue has such character and lends itself beautifully to a wedding reception. We have received so many compliments from our guests and I would encourage anyone thinking about booking their wedding at the LRC to do it, you will not regret it! We were lucky to be blessed with beautiful weather so were able to have our jazz musicians play on the balcony for the drinks reception before moving into the Long Room for our meal. It looked stunning with the tables dressed and mantles adorned with flowers. Following the meal and speeches, guests enjoyed drinks back on the balcony and in the Fairburn and Members Rooms which provide plenty of seating, whilst the Long Room was cleared and the band set up. We then partied the night away.

From start to finish, the organisation was so straight forward. Annabel was very accommodating and full of helpful advice in the run up. I knew that on the day she would ensure things ran like clock work, which of course they did. Our suppliers also commented on how helpful the LRC team were to work with. On the day the staff were brilliant and went out of their way to ensure everything ran smoothly (including borrowing some large gym fans from the rowers to put in the Long Room to keep us cool as it was an unexpectedly hot day). We really can’t thank you enough and now need to think of an excuse to host another party with you in the future!"
V140,London Rowing Club,"We got married in St. Mary's church and then had our reception in the London Rowing Club in February 2023. It far exceeded our expectations and was an incredible fabulous stress-free day with thanks to the wonderful Annabel making the day just run.

In the lead up to the event, Annabel was incredibly responsive, helpful and helped us plan the day exactly how we wanted it. She answered all our questions really quickly, always got back to us, was very flexible with what we could do and allowing us to personalise the space. Prior to the event, Annabel arranged for us to go and have a look around on a couple of additional occasions to help us plan how we would want it to look. She also gave our caterers a tour of the kitchens as they were new to the venue.

In the immediate lead up to the day, Annabel helped with our suppliers in getting chairs delivered and bringing all the wine over a day earlier. On the day, she helped to make the day flow and just dealt with things throughout the day.

The venue itself is beautiful with three rooms to use. A middle reception room, a cosy snug and the main long room. In the main long room, there is a rowing boat hanging upside down with fairly lights. The main lighting can be dimmed and gave a wonderful atmosphere for the evening meal. As our wedding was a winter wedding, it was fairly chilly so they lit fires in the main room and snug which added to the atmosphere.

We had around 90 guests - could have fitted a few more just about. We used the round tables, tablecloths, linen, plates cutlery and glasses provided and they were perfect for a wedding and looked very smart. No need to hire these. As mentioned, we did hire separate wedding chairs instead of the conference chairs provided. There's a lot of decoration in the way of rowing memorabilia on the walls which means you don't have to actually do too much to make it interesting for guests.

Overall, the perfect London wedding venue with absolutely fabulous views across the Thames with a long balcony to enjoy from. To top it off Annabel is truly amazing and so helpful."
V140,London Rowing Club,"We had our wedding (ceremony+reception) at LRC in July, and the venue itself and the team we worked with were absolutely incredible! Everything on the day went without a hitch and we heard so many compliments on the location - our guests loved the balcony and the layout inside, which included plenty of space for anyone wanting a break from dancing to sit down and relax. Would recommend to anyone looking to host an event!"
V140,London Rowing Club,"London Rowing Club is a truly fantastic venue and we were both so delighted with how our day went! The venue has real character with the classic rowing memorabilia and it’s location on the Thames, and looks amazing when it’s all set up. The layout and size of rooms I thought were perfect for our wedding of about 70 (+15ish more in the evenings) and of course the big attraction is the balcony which all of our guests adored!! (I wish I’d had more time during the day to stand out there and enjoy it 😂). Not only is it a fantastic venue in a great location but what really made this the most amazing venue was how great all of the staff, and all the recommend suppliers were! The day exceeded expectations and we got compliments on the place and the staff from all our guests. Couldn’t be happier with the venue, it was perfect for us!!"
V140,London Rowing Club,"We found the London Rowing Club while desperately combing through London locations after our original venue fell through a few months before the day.
Luckily for us it was available due to a cancellation - kismet!
From the start the charming Annabel put us very much at ease and helped us to envisage the day as we hoped it would be. She was very flexible and helpful throughout the planning process.
We were incredibly lucky with the weather on the day and the venue really came into its own - it was virtually impossible to get guests off the terrace, which is the perfect size for our smallish event (65 people) and of course offers gorgeous river views.
We were well looked after by the team and everything went off without a hitch. The interior of the space itself is lovely with a great sense of history.
Nice additional touch - table tennis was made available in the entry room for the later part of the evening!

It's a special place and I'd thoroughly recommend for anyone seeking a memorable spot to tie the knot!"
V140,London Rowing Club,"We got married at the London Rowing Club on a brilliantly sunny winter day on Saturday. All the way through in the run up (after 2 years or more of postponements), Annabel and team bent over backwards to help us arrange everything, recommended some brilliant suppliers for food (Shona Pollock comes highly recommended) and flowers (same with Steph the charityflorist.)

So many of our guests said how lovely the venue and staff were on the day, and the whole place looked a million dollars with an amazing photo set on and around the balcony and river - although we haven't seen those yet. The corkage and bar tariff prices are also incredibly reasonable for an inner London location!

I can't recommend the LRC highly enough. It will live in memory for a very long time."
V140,London Rowing Club,"The London Rowing Club team alongside the Dinner Ladies went above and beyond to ensure that we had the wedding perfectly fitting our requirements. Throughout the entire all of the suppliers worked seamlessly together to ensure the space transformed as we progressively added guests and transitioned between eating, our ceremony, more eating, music and dancing. We wouldn’t have had it any other way. The attention to detail of the team is second to none - perfect for any bride and groom seeking a beautiful event."
V141,The Prince Albert,"The team at The Prince Albert were always accommodating, made everything easy and stress-free, and helped us organise an amazing wedding party. They really knew what they were doing, and helped guide us through the process calmly, working around our schedule (which wasn't easy - we live abroad!) to make sure all our last-minute worries and concerns were sorted smoothly. The food was excellent, and the space was fantastic for our party. Can't recommend it highly enough!"
V141,The Prince Albert,"We had such a happy wedding with Harrison and this venue. Harrison was really flexible and answered any questions we had and made great suggestions when we needed seating arrangements, the schedule for the day, a florist, and more. The day was accessible to everyone and the food and drink were perfect. Thank you for making out wedding stress free and wonderful."
V141,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert was the most wonderful venue for our London wedding. We came across the venue at there wedding fair and chose alot of our suppliers from the same wedding fair.

Harrison and Lauren were always so on hand to help with any questions and did a fantastic job answering all of our questions. The staff were so friendly and helpful and made everything run like clockwork.

We couldn’t recommend The Prince Albert enough for a london wedding and would love to do it all again."
V141,The Prince Albert,"My wife and I were beyond happy with how everything went on our wedding day. Harrison, Diana, Claudio and the whole team were absolutely phenomenal! It was such a beautifully efficient operation, and we always felt like someone was there to help us when needed.

We've had dozens of compliments about the great food and how wonderfully intimate the venue was for a wedding. Some of our more traditional relatives said they were initially sceptical at the prospect of a pub wedding, but that it was one of the most beautiful and joyful weddings they’d been to. A friend of mine was also very happy that someone at the bar remembered her drink order throughout the evening! On top of that, everything ran perfectly to schedule, which is no doubt down to the high attention to detail.

It was very useful that the upstairs was free on Friday afternoon so that we could set up the space. It gave us plenty of time to do the flower arrangements, put up the bunting, and stick photos on the frame wall.

Thank you again so much for all the help and support you've given us - it really was the best day of our lives (so far)!"
V141,The Prince Albert,"My husband and I got married here in late September 2023, and I cannot recommend the Prince Albert enough!! Booking a wedding venue can be stressful and we felt like a lot of the venues we looked at gave us the ""hard sell"" but the folks at the Prince Albert helped to put us at ease every step of the way. We fell in love with how beautiful the pub was, so hired the upstairs for the ceremony, wedding breakfast and party afterwards for around 40 - 45 people. We were able to drop off decorations the night before and talk it all through with the staff, and they did such a good job of working with us and the florist to get the place looking amazing. The ceremony went off without a hitch, everybody loved the food and we had a blast in the evening. All the staff were amazing, but special shout out to Harrison and Lauren for helping us plan and run the day, and Maria for managing everything on the ground both when we dropped off the decorations and during the wedding itself. Thank you again for helping us celebrate our special day with our loved ones, for making it so stress free and so memorable!"
V141,The Prince Albert,"All you ever hear about wedding venues is that everything is a rip off, the food is meh, and there are a ton of annoying restrictions...the opposite is true of Harrison and The Prince Albert team. From Day 1, Harrison made the whole process not only easy but really fun! He was quick to respond, super knowledgeable, and very accommodating; he even helped our best man execute a surprise for us without it disrupting any timings. On the day, they decorated the place beautifully, managed to serve a 3 course dinner to 76 people unbelievably fast, and everyone raved about the food - to say they did a good job is a gross understatement, they went above and beyond. We were after ""classy fun"" and that's exactly what we got - thank you so so much!"
V141,The Prince Albert,"We had the exact wedding reception we wanted at the Prince Albert thanks to Harrison, Claudio and the other amazing staff who helped us feel so relaxed in the build up and during. We wanted a very low-key vibe and the team understood that but there were enough options for any style of wedding you wanted. The upstairs function room felt cozy and intimate while still leaving breathing room and space to dance, but you could easily rent the whole place if you wanted more guests and even choose to do your ceremony there. We had the most compliments on our food (we chose a buffet option). The team were particularly accomodating to some complicated dietary requirements and it was all delicious."
V141,The Prince Albert,"July 6, 2023 was the most memorable day of our lives! A big thank you to Harrison and the rest of the team for assisting us through out the whole process. Our guests loved the Prince Albert pub especially the sumptuous food and booze on our wedding day!

David & Dannah"
V141,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert is a Great venue for the classic Pub Wedding.
Harrison and the team did an amazing job to organize everything. The food was great and the service first class. Only sorry it was over so quickly. Thanks again for everything."
V141,The Prince Albert,"We found The Prince Albert when our original venue cancelled on us less than 2 months before our wedding. & we are so glad we did; everything happens for a reason! From the moment we met Harrison, we knew we were in safe hands, and the team at the Prince Albert made our day amazing. The pub looked beautiful and we were very greatful for the effort the team put in putting up all our decorations. We had so many compliments about the food, and we were very impressed in the swift and organised manner in whichever it was served. Everyone had a wonderful time, and we would not hesitate in recommending The Prince Albert."
V142,Kindred,"We chose Kindred for our 60 person wedding and it could not have been better. We wanted a venue where we could have the ceremony, dinner and dancing all under one roof, that was wheelchair accessible, and easy to get to on the tube, Kindred ticks all those boxes and more!
The food is incredible, we really enjoyed popping by to do all the tastings, we'll continue to come to the Cellar for food and cocktails. Many guests commented on how good the food was.
The place itself is gorgeous, inside and out. We used the whole venue, the main Hall for the ceremony, dinner and dancing, and the Library upstairs for the drinks reception and cake cutting. Also, being right next to Hammersmith station, the venue could not be easier to get to!
The staff are wonderfully attentive and helpful, both before and on the day. They were really open to the little details that made our day uniquely ours, from the drinks selections, to having a table and glasses on stage for the ceremony, to playing our music selections at the right time. Plus its a dog friendly venue!"
V142,Kindred,"We LOVE this venue! We got married here with only 12 weeks notice and Anna, the owner, and her staff went above and beyond to make the day as memorable, magical, and marvellous as we'd hoped it would be. The venue is elegant, stylish and perfect for a London, city based wedding. The food is sensational as it comes from their in-house kitchen on the ground floor and every guest remarked on how delicious their meal was. It's restaurant quality food, not your standard wedding food. The place looks stunning in all our wedding photos and the wedding cake they made us (at very short notice I might add!) was second to none. Everyone loved it. The venue was also perfect for late night dancing and drinking and merriment. It was such a pleasure - and a breeze - to work with Anna and her team on one of the most important days of my life, and I very much hope to do so again in the future. I will forever be grateful to her and all she helped us with."
V142,Kindred,"We had our wedding reception for 35 guests at Kindred, in the Library and Salon earlier this year. The day went incredibly smoothly, the staff couldn't have been more attentive and our guests raved about the food for weeks afterwards. It was the perfect sized space for our intimate celebration, really cosy and the atmosphere was great. The little touches really helped to make the day special, with espresso martinis served for the speeches and sparklers for our exit at the end of the night. Thanks again to the lovely Kindred team!"
V142,Kindred,"I cannot find a single fault in our experience with Kindred for our wedding. Not only was it a stunning venue that honestly made some of our guests gasp as they arrived, but Anna and the team were so incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. Having them support us really took so much of the wedding planning stress away and we knew we were in safe hands. I really appreciated that the team were happy to chat through ideas with me and were always keen to find creative solutions to give us the day that we had envisioned.

The food was absolutely delicious and they were so accommodating for our long list of dietary requirements from our guest. The cocktails were also so delicious. Our guests were buzzing for weeks after, as were we.

On the night, the staff were not only incredibly helpful and efficient, but also just so friendly, welcoming and complimentary. We felt thoroughly spoilt and very well looked after.

We visited so many venues and this was by far the best choice for us. The interiors made for some stunning photos and the layout of the spacing meant that whilst we had 80-100 guests, it still felt very intimate. I cannot recommend Kindred enough!"
V142,Kindred,"We would give a thousand stars if we could. Kindred hosted us for our cocktail style wedding and it was everything we could have hoped for and the perfect venue for this style of wedding. The wine, cocktails and food (incredible grazing board, canapés, bowls and pizzas) were exceptional and the team were on top of everything, friendly and nothing was ever an issue. We would HIGHLY recommend it. We have had loads of guests message us to tell us what a spectacular venue it was with the most friendly team. The venue had different spaces to suit our needs and the AV is amazing - it worked perfectly for our live music band and our DJ, and our own music playlists for our ceremony. They took the stress off planning and really did mean we could relax and not worry that everything would run smoothly. Thank you so much Kindred team for giving us the best day of our lives"
V143,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The best day of our lives and me and my now husband couldn't be more thankful to Bredenbury. Before booking Bredenbury we visited over 17 wedding venues in Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Herefordshire - we fell in love instantly, there is no need for a crazy amount of extra expense on decorations, the venue speaks for itself. The fact that it was no corkage just added to why we wanted to book and the team were so friendly. In the lead up to the wedding they were brilliant, we booked far in advance and brought over all our family members to come see the venue, they were so flexible, understanding and welcoming - they couldn't do enough for us. On the wedding day they had decorated for us by the time we had arrived and all we had to do on the day was to enjoy it - which was perfect. It really was the best day of our lives, all the comments from our family and friends was how beautiful the venue was. They kept the day running so smooth and we didn't need to think about a thing."
V143,Bredenbury Court Barns,"There truly aren't words to describe how incredible Bredenbury Court Barns and their entire team of fantastic staff were through the planning process and the day itself. They were so friendly, supportive and nothing was ever too much. From quick replies to any questions that popped to mind to planning meetings that left us feeling prepared and ready to the day being set up beyond perfectly. Our amazing wedding coordinator Lianna spent the days and months (years really!) leading up to our big day making sure everyone detail was perfect, that everything was incorporated that we'd dreamed of and made sure we didn't feel a moment of stress from start to finish. All throughout the building from the bridal booth, to the orangery to the oak barn was beautifully light and open - even with our wedding being the end of October - and we had so many compliments about this! There aren't enough words to say thank you and explain just how much we'd recommend this venue to everyone"
V143,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We had the perfect day back in July. The weather didn't go to plan but they helped make the day so special even with the last minute switches because of the rain. We had such an amazing day and the feedback from our guests about the venue, food and service was great! We cannot thank the team enough for the effort they put in throughout the whole process but especially on the day. We felt incredibly supported throughout the whole process."
V143,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The venue itself is stunning. The buildings, grounds and interior decorations are all beautiful and immaculately presented. From the moment you turn down the lane it is so picturesque, you know you've found somewhere special. It's exactly what we were imagining for our wedding venue.

The layout is perfect, with ample space for guests to mingle and move about, and great accessibility for older and disabled guests. Ours was a winter wedding, and while most of the day was inside it wasn't cramped and we could still enjoy the beautiful grounds through the expansive windows that run along the whole barn.

All of the venue is stunning, but practicality-wise the Bridal Suite warrants a special mention. Room length mirrors, plenty of room for the bridal party to get ready, have their makeup and hair done, and if there's time to relax as well. Drinks were served from 11 onwards, and it has it's own toilets and shower.

From our first meeting at Bredenbury the staff were exceptional. They gave a reassuring air of professionalism and experience, with just the right level of excitedness for our day without it feeling forced. We were really impressed by how responsive the whole team were, with speedy replies to any questions we had during the planning. This is something we particularly appreciated as we only gave ourselves 7 weeks to plan our big day.

Value for money wise it felt tricky to gauge when we were trying to choose a venue as the headline figure is rarely what you'll end up paying, with different venues charging different amounts for different things. Not the case with Bredenbury. With their No Corkage policy and generosity in being able to use whatever props they already have, any extras were non-essentials of our own choosing.

No Corkage is pretty significant. Some venues wanted to charge £20/bottle, so not having to pay this and being able to supply not only our own wine but beers, gin and soft drinks for the drinks reception and wedding breakfast was not only a massive saving but also made the occasion more personal for us. The bar staff and catering team were excellent, pouring and serving drinks, warming our mulled wine and setting up the gin bar. Once your guests have drunk you dry the venue's bar is well stocked and standard pub pricing.

We wanted a Christmas wedding and seeing in early November that they had a date available that December we couldn't resist. 7 weeks isn't long to organise a wedding with nearly 100 guests, and we couldn't have done it without the Bredenbury team being so organised. Our assigned event manager, Harriet, was brilliant in the runup and on the day, as were all the other managers and staff we spoke with. The Wedding Bible they fill out with you is a great idea and nails down all the finer details to ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible on the day.

We didn't want to have to spend the day before and morning of our wedding worrying about set up and decorations, but needn't have worried as Bredenbury did all of this for us. A meeting beforehand clarified what we wanted where; we simply dropped off boxes of stuff the day before and rocked up in the morning to find everything laid out as hoped.

This organisation extended to the third party suppliers, of which Bredenbury have an extensive list of local recommendations. We booked the ceiling lights with Cotswold Wedding Co. and didn't have to do anything else. The band, Apollo Gold (incredible!!) set up without any hassle and didn't have any issues with Bredenbury's noise limiter. Our florist Katrina Bevis hadn't been there before, but again had no problem getting everything in place on the morning.

On-site accommodation was good for close family and friends, but there's not enough for the majority of guests and the lack of a dedicated honeymoon suite is a bit of a shame. If you want privacy for your first night as a married couple it means taking over an entire lodge. The quality and comfort of the rooms is excellent, though, and the continental breakfast served the morning after in the East Lodge was delicious, with ample options for Vegan and Gluten Free.

Jenkinsons are the exclusive caterer for Bredenbury and have an extensive menu for nibbles, the wedding breakfast and dinner. The menu and ordering process is clear, and pricing is what we expected to pay. Food and service was as slick and faff-free as everything else. A real delight.

On the day, Harriet and the catering manager were absolute superstars. Zero stress, everything ran to time and as planned, and they were always available if we had any questions or needed help.

The whole day was perfect and exactly what we wanted. I don't think we could have achieved this without the exceptional organisation of Harriet and the team. The entire process was very slick, zero stress, and we wouldn't hesitate in recommending Bredenbury Court Barns to anyone looking to get married in a countryside paradise."
V143,Bredenbury Court Barns,"I want to say a massive thank you to Bredenbury Court Barns for hosting our wedding. From the start they were super amazing and accommodating to us. They won us over with their care and support even when we had a pickle in the beginning.

Olivia was super helpful from the start and throughout the year we were planning she offered huge amount of support and suggestions.

We typed in “orangery weddings” in google when we were first looking because I was keen to get a ceremony in an orangery and Bredenbury popped up after much searching. Once we saw the Orangery we cancelled every other viewing we had across the country because we felt we found the perfect place, and nothing compared to the reception with the beautiful windows that brought all the light in. The grounds were absolutely spectacular and gorgeous. It was a no brainer for us to pick such a beautiful venue. They brought my ideas to life and we were able to get support on anything from recommendation of suppliers, to ideas on decor to their favourite meals from Jenkinson’s. They fully outdid themselves in love for us. We can’t forget it.

Our wedding day was exceptional with Lianna helping us all the way. She was a breath of fresh air. She cared about all the little details and made us feel relaxed and had a good laugh with us. The fact she was there 100% of the way, before the wedding, during the wedding, and even after is unmatched! Thank you Lianna for really being there to make our wedding day smooth and relaxing.

The food was incredible too and we often think about how sad it is that we didn’t finish our second plates, we think about it a lot.

Thank you for the wonderful journey BCB, you blew us away with your integrity, kindness, and genuine support!"
V143,Bredenbury Court Barns,thank you to everyone at bredenbury court barns who made our day so special
V143,Bredenbury Court Barns,"From the moment we stepped foot into Bredenbury Court Barns, we knew this was the venue for us. It was the first and only venue we viewed as we were blown away by how gorgeous the venue is. The venue itself is absolutely stunning, with breathtaking views and impeccably maintained grounds that set the perfect backdrop for our special day.

The staff went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. From our first consultation to the last dance, their professionalism and attention to detail were exceptional. Harriet was absolutely brilliant and I don’t know what we would have done without her!

The food was another highlight—our guests are still talking about how delicious everything was! Jenkinsons are amazing, they helped us personalise our menu perfectly!

We couldn’t have asked for a more beautiful venue to have our wedding. The day couldn’t have been more perfect! Thank you to everyone at Bredenbury Court Barns for making our wedding day nothing short of magical!"
V143,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We could not have had a more perfect experience with Bredenbury Court Barns. Right from initial booking all the way through to breakfast the following morning, everything was perfect. Nothing was too much trouble for our wonderful planner, Lianna. She ensured the day ran smoothly and our months of planning turned out exactly as we’d imagined. They are available to answer any questions you have any time, they’re only an email away and get back to you so fast. The venue itself if just gorgeous, the grounds make for some wonderful photos, and the orangery lets so much light in that your ceremony photos are gorgeous. The whole place is fully air conditioned too which was great for our July wedding. The bridal suite is a perfect balance of being aesthetically pleasing and practical for getting ready in, it’s so spacious, lots of natural light, there’s plenty of plug sockets and huge mirrors so everyone has plenty of room for getting ready and no one is on top of eachother. There’s even an outside space for getting some fresh air. I’m so glad we chose to have our wedding here, it’s given us memories to cherish forever and there are zero memories of any stress!! Cannot recommend this venue enough!"
V143,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We cannot believe how lucky we fell to get married at such a beautiful venue. Right from the offset of viewing the venue, to our special day, we were taken of. No question was too silly, and so much pressure was taken off us during the planning. We managed to make everything our own and Lianna was there every step of the way. Thank you for giving us our happily ever after. We will forever be grateful."
V143,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We loved our wedding at Bredenbury the team did an amazing job providing everything we asked for and more. We especially liked that our wedding coordinator for the day, Harriet had thought of everything for us she went above and beyond and even offered to go and get my mum some more shoes when hers broke! absolute 5-star service and the food was amazing too!"
