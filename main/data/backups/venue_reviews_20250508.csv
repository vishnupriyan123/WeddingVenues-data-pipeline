V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow what can I say, Brinsop is an absolutely stunning wedding venue with heaps of character and so many options of places for the ceremony and to do things. We fell in love with it as soon as we saw it and knew it was where we wanted to get married.

Right from the start, the Brinsop team were so helpful and accommodating. From giving an virtual tour then showing us around in person, Issy and the team were fantastic right the way through. Nothing was a hassle, no request too difficult and they were incredibly professional and responsive throughout the whole process.

We loved that Brinsop is an exclusive venue with accommodation on site so we could stay with the bridal party and our immediate family. All the rooms are unique and have so much character and it's fun exploring the whole place. You feel like you are in the middle of nowhere, in nature with swans, ducks and birds all around.

Throughout our planning process, Issy and the team helped us every step of the way, being incredibly flexible in managing our requests and really trying to create our vision. They even got their team to make a giant jenga that we could use on the day! They helped to create the most perfect bespoke wedding breakfast and canapes menu, and seemed so positive and excited to be part of our special day and experience.

Arriving at the venue, Issy and the team were ready and had everything prepared and ready to go. It made the process so smooth for us and meant we could really enjoy the day without any stress. Issy coordinated perfectly with all of our vendors and it really felt like she and the whole team were so happy for us and wanted to be part of our day which was amazing. Our guests commented on how friendly and responsive all the staff were and it really made the experience extra special.

I wouldn't change anything about the day and it was perfect. I would absolutely recommend Brinsop as a wedding venue and all the staff who are really invested in helping deliver your vision. Thank you so so much to the whole team for making this a day that we will look back on for many years to come with amazing memories."
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow, what a perfect day we had! It really went without a hitch and that was thanks to Nina and all the staff at Brinsop. The team worked seamlessly to ensure the day was as perfect as could be, and it really was! The wedding was booked over 2 years in advance and the staff were so accommodating with all my questions, planning and site visits, they couldn’t do more to support us. Special thanks to our coordinator Nina who was a delight to work with and a credit to Brinsop. Everyone that attended agreed at how beautiful the venue and grounds were, it was a wedding people won’t forget! 10/10 would recommend to anyone!"
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"It's taken me quite a while to get round to writing this review, because sadly it's quite a bittersweet one.

We were married last year on 15 June and Brinsop was our chosen venue for both our ceremony and reception. We were first attracted to brinsop by the accomodation, meaning our loved ones could stay on-site, especially my grandparents which was so important to me.

The home itself is absolutely beautiful, including ivy cottage which myself and my mum stayed in the night before the big day. It really was a picture perfect setting, and looking down from the bridal suite seeing the ceremony space being set up on the Wordsworth lawn was honestly magical. Id dreamed of an outdoor wedding on that lawn, and we were so grateful the weather cleared so we could have it. The team really did wait till the latest they could to ask us to make a call on an inside or outside wedding (despite being June, it was a gloomy day to start) which I really appreciated!

Another amazing part of hiring brinsop was the after hours space we were able to enjoy until 2am with our house guests. The games room was absolute fantastic and meant that if you wanted to go to bed you could, but you could also stay up, party and play pool. I really do think this was a highlight for our guests and would recommend massively if you can spare some budget.

On the night of the wedding, myself and my new husband actually stayed in one glamping tents which we absolutely loved. The groundsman was on site until we were ready to leave the games room, and he then took us up to our tent in one of the buggies, making sure we had plenty of blankets and even stopping off for some bottles of water for us. This was really special, and can't thank him enough.

Hugo Spritz!! Having hugos at both our welcome drinks and drinks reception after the ceremony was amazing. I'm not a fan of prosecco myself and Mark and the team made it possible for us to have Hugo's all round. We even sneaked some up to the bridal suite to have before the ceremony (thanks Nadia!). Our guests loved them, and the amount of people that have told me they now need them at their own wedding is crazy!

Onto the not so good - sadly it all started to go a little downhill when we moved things into the knot barn for our wedding breakfast. Sitting on the top table, I could see that guests at the top of the second rows of long tables didn't really even have a seat around the table and were just kind of plonked on. The seating plan hadn't been followed, and I don't think there were even enough tables laid for the service to be comfortable for people because there was a dance floor at the end of the barn (which I did not ask for).

It was quickly also brought to my attention, that one of our guests had had to put her child on her lap in order to remove the high chair so people had more space. We also lost about 5 napkins with them setting on fire from the candles because everything was just way too cramped.

I asked to speak to catering, and asked if there was anything that they could do. I was told 'well sure, if you want the whole thing to be late'. In truth I shouldn't have even had to broach this myself, as it should have been sorted by the coordination team.

The tables weren't changed, even after they'd said they'd sort after the first course and yet the whole meal still ran late. We've had so much feedback about people not having enough food, food not being easy to access on the sharing platters etc and honestly when you've waited so long for a day and had spent 25k on the venue and food alone, it really has been heartbreaking to hear. I do sometimes question why people still bring it up (even now, people talk about the dining) when it clearly upset me so much.

Whilst writing this review my husband asked my what we had for evening food - we didn't get any. It was left unannounced on a back table. I don't know what I was expecting, just not that.

The next morning, the houseguests were asked to come down to breakfast for 9am (it was on a note in the room) but as we were in the glamping area, we walked past the knot barn just before 8.30 and the food was already out. We ran down to the house to hurry everyone up, and by which time everyone arrived it had been sitting there for 20plus mins going cold.

My biggest upset was that when I fed all of the above back to brinsop, feeling pretty deflated about the catering, I was told they'd pass my feedback on and heard absolutely nothing back. 25k total with over 10k on food and drinks to hear absolutely nothing, and this was 9 months ago. I'm not saying this in would happen to anyone else, but really - it shouldn't have happened to us either."
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our wedding! From start to finish, everything at Brinsop was flawless. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most magical backdrop for our special day. Our guests were blown away by the beautiful venue, the warm atmosphere, and the seamless coordination. Every detail was taken care of, and we felt so well looked after. The team was incredible, professional, friendly, and attentive. On the day itself, they ensured everything ran smoothly, allowing us to truly enjoy every moment. A special mention goes to our amazing wedding coordinator Nina!"
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We had our wedding on New Year's Eve 2024 at Brinsop, and it was more perfect that we could have ever hoped for. The venue itself is stunning, with beautiful spacious rooms which slept over 40 of our guests. Our coordinator, Nina, was incredible and so supportive on the day - she kept everything running so smoothly and everything went by without a glitch. The food and drink managers Mark and Amy did the most incredible job - nothing was ever too much, they were so attentive, and the chefs the most stunning meal after we gave them a fairly vague brief of 'curry'! We had the most perfect day and we're so incredibly grateful to Brinsop and the team."
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,Brinsop Court is pure magic—an unforgettable venue with an incredible team!
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We were lucky enough to have our wedding at Brinsop Court in December, and it was an absolutely spectacular day. We fell in love with Brinsop as soon we set our eyes on the beautiful manor and surrounding gardens. Cate, Amy, Mark and the rest of the wonderful staff at Brinsop really go the extra mile to make you feel special, and are extremely flexible with requests in order to make your day feel more special. We honestly felt like there was no request too big leading up to the day and they really made us feel extremely comfortable leading up to the day.
On the day, Cate and her team were well on hand to help us with setting up everything and she had everything under control when there were a few hiccups. The day itself was absolutely magical, and that wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for everyone at Brinsop working extremely hard to ensure that everything went to plan and as smoothly as it could.
Thank you to everyone at Brinsop for making us feel at ease and ensuring that our wedding was an amazing day."
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Brinsop, the perfect wedding venue! We got married at Brinsop in December and I can honestly say it was everything we could have hoped for and more. We found out about the venue through Hitched and was one of only two venues that we visited but as soon as we got the house we knew it was the one. We fell in love with everything about it and it was fair to say that our guests agreed with us with many saying it was the nicest venue they’d been to. We had the wonderful Nina as our coordinator and she was brilliant! Nothing was too much trouble and we had constant communication with her in the build up which helped our stress levels no end. The same can be said for all of the staff who were brilliant throughout and allowed us to have the best day of our lives with everything running seamlessly. A special mention must be given to Amy and the catering staff who put on such an incredible menu (including the tasting session that provided some of the best food we’d ever had) and ensured that the food has been one of the main things that people have mentioned to us since the wedding! We had our ceremony in the Banqueting Hall which provided the perfect setting, especially with it being a winter wedding, as it really added to the cosy atmosphere and the lounge areas/games room were perfect for the drink’s reception. We would have loved to have also had it in the courtyard, but the temperatures meant that the lounge with the fireplace was a far more appealing option on the day. We then had the wedding breakfast and reception in the knot barn which was decorated beautifully and was the perfect place for the party in the evening. Overall we really can’t thank everyone at Brinsop enough for making our day what it was, we can honestly say that we have been made to feel part of the family and already can’t wait to hopefully come back to stay in one of the cottages for our first anniversary!"
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Where do I start!!
Brinop Court is the most stunning venue, it was the first venue we visited and instantly fell in love! Theres so much history to the house and we were treated like family every time we visited before the wedding and it literally felt like home the whole weekend of the wedding, my guests also agreed!!

A special thank you to Issy our coodinator who went above and beyond ti make sure everything was perfect for us. It was so easy to plan and nothing was too much to ask, even arranging our dog to be our ring bearer!! When they say Brinsop is dog friendly they really mean it!!!

What a place, what a day!! Thank you so much everyone, you all made our day perfect and it really was the best day of our lives♥️"
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We got married at the gorgeous Brinsop in October this year. It’s hard to put into words how amazing the whole experience was. We honestly had the best day of our lives!!!

We fell in love with Brinsop during our first visit back in December 2022. We knew almost immediately that Brinsop was the venue we were looking for! From the outside the venue looked like a painting - from the picturesque views of the countryside, to the swans swimming on the moat! The manor house itself has so much character, and has a lovely homely feel to it as you walk around it. Our guests were equally blown away by the venue!

A big thing for us was that it’s dog friendly, which meant we could have our two dogs join us on our special day, it wouldn’t have been the same without them there! They had so much fun walking around the grounds and greeting all of our guests!

Nina, our coordinator, and her team were always available to answer any of our questions in the run up to the day. This really put us at ease, knowing we were in safe hands. On the day, Nina and the team made sure everything ran smoothly and went above and beyond to ensure our guests were looked after. A shout out to Amy who heads up catering and Mark who manages the bar. The food and drinks were absolutely fantastic!

I highly recommend this venue! There’s a reason Brinsop is an award winning venue - and when you visit it’s not hard to see why. We are already looking forward to going back there for a date night next year! Thanks for everything Team Brinsop!

V2,The Manor at Bickley,"The Manor is the perfect venue for weddings! When our wedding venue fell through 4 months before the big day, I stumbled onto the Manor at Bickley and spoke to Craig. He was most helpful and kind and went above and beyond to make sure our wedding went ahead.

We hired the venue for our two day wedding and the staff were helpful and accommodating from start to finish. All of our guests were awed by the beautiful well kept grounds and the excellent service. We can’t thank the staff enough for making our wedding dreams a reality. They thought of every detail from bringing us champagne after our civil ceremony to making sure we had our card box at the end of the night! We are excited to head back to celebrate our anniversary there!"
V2,The Manor at Bickley,"Myself and my Husband chose this venue for our wedding last week and we can’t sing The Manor’s praises enough. From our very first enquiry, to the first viewing of the venue, right though until the big day, the staff at the manor have been nothing short of brilliant! Each staff member we came across was polite and accommodating. Special mention to Craig and Vicky with whom we did most of our liaising throughout the months leading up until our wedding. Craig and Vicky were super helpful, responsive and went above and beyond to make sure that we could have the day of our dreams. Even with last minute changes due to the weather, Craig who was just incredible throughout, managed to help us sort a backup plan so our day would still go ahead seamlessly.

The rooms at the manor were spacious and modern, giving us and our wedding party lots of space for photographers and videographers to capture the special moments on our wedding morning.

The lodge that was used for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready was fabulous. The manor was very flexible in giving us early access so we could get ready on time.

The grand marquee was definitely grand! Very spacious and when decorated looked like something out of a fairytale! lots of kitchen space, a huge bar and fantastic overhead speakers for the party!

The manor was super flexible to our needs regarding access, start times, outsourcing our vendors and much more. The venue is beautiful and spacious with options for outdoor and indoor events and entertainment. The grounds were absolutely beautiful, so many lovely spots for photos not only for us as the bride and groom but for guests too!

A very special thank you to our point of contact throughout, Craig. From our first meeting, he was charming, bubbly and made us feel super welcome. He reassured us that he has experience in African/Caribbean weddings and that our wedding day would amazing and it was. He was attentive and always let us know that he was only a phone call or e-mail away and was always quick to respond and answer any questions we had.

All in all, we had the most beautiful day at The manor and we would definitely recommend this venue for a wedding or other events.

V2,The Manor at Bickley,"We hired The Manor at Bickley for my daughters wedding. Got a brilliant service from the venue. Everything was set accordingly, as per floor plan. Our guests were loved the venue grounds/facilities and the overall wedding set up.
Thank you to everyone at Bickley."
V2,The Manor at Bickley,"A warm and friendly service from the very helpful staff, a feeling that it is your own house! The food was amazing and the atmosphere made us and our guests feel fantastic."
V3,Davenport House,We are so pleased we chose Davenport House for our wedding reception. Charley and the team were so helpful and thoughtful. Putting canapés behind the bar for us and making sure everything ran so smoothly. I am obsessed with the stunning house and grounds and it was absolutely perfect! Thank you so much for making our day so special!!
V3,Davenport House,"Davenport House is a STUNNING wedding venue so how could we not have it for our big day!?

The staff were exceptional! From the moment we booked through to our big day, we had an absolute blast and could not thank each member of staff enough! Special shout out to Jared (hopefully spelt right, haha!) who made sure we were fed, watered and ensured we took 5 minutes to ourselves every moment we could - Also even saved us slices of pie wedding cake before we went to bed!

Our guests have said they have never been to a wedding so spectacular, with the most amazing food and amazing staff so could not have been happier having Davenport as our venue! 🩷"
V3,Davenport House,"I just wanted to write to say a huge, enormous thank you to Charley and all the team at Davenport House. We still can’t believe how perfect our day was, and lots of our guests have told us it’s the best wedding they’ve ever been to. The team were all a huge part of making that happen. It was incredibly seamless and well planned on the day, meaning we genuinely didn’t have to think about a thing, except for enjoying ourselves. The day ran to schedule perfectly and even certain touches we didn’t know or expect to happen were planned by you and the team, which made the day even more special. Thank you so much for giving us our dream wedding day. We can’t wait to see the full set of pictures and the video now to relive it all!"
V3,Davenport House,"Without doubt the best day of our lives. From start to finish, Davenport has exceeded expectations. From the very first impression of the venue during the open day, the incredible food tasting evening, all the way through to the day itself, including the support and preparation leading up to it. It was really important to us to pick a venue that not only ticked the fairytale box, but also come with the complete support of a wedding planner, due to our busy jobs. We were lucky enough to have Charley as ours. She really took the time to listen and get to know us, to ensure the day was tailored to exactly what we wanted. We even had our own cocktail designed, which went down an absolute storm on the day! She considered every little detail, constantly putting our minds at ease, which made the whole process so easy and enjoyable. Honestly the day couldn’t have gone smoother, any anxiety or stress faded immediately as soon as we got to the venue. It was simply perfect. So many of our guests were complimentary of just how beautiful the venue is and just how well organised the day was, and that is the perfect way to summarise Davenport. Any prospective couples thinking of selecting Davenport as their venue, hesitate no further. It will be a day you never knew was possible! We cannot thank you enough Charley and the Davenport team, if only we could live the day over and over again"
V3,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was amazing. When looking for a venue we weren't just looking for something wow, we needed to have people who were enthused and passionate about their work - we found that at Davenport House.

From our first phone call & meeting with Lizzie and Tallulah, we knew this was the place for us. Having two brides wasn’t an issue; combining British, Asian and Spanish cultures - wasn't an issue; having brides enter together – wasn’t an issue. Nothing was an issue. At Davenport House, we got it all – a picturesque venue and the best team of staff anyone could ever wish for. All our external suppliers have commented what a fantastic venue you are. All out guests have said that the service and attention to detail was second to none. The thoughtful touches like hiring a Spanish speaking waiter for the table which spoke very little English ensured that everyone felt welcomed. Guests with dietary requirements didn't feel they got a second rate meal or they were an afterthought - the food for all throughout the day was exceptional. The rooms / cottages where our guests and we stayed, spotless and comfortable. The thought behind adding some cheese and Spanish ham to the morning breakfast - so sweet!

Special shout out to Megan - wedding planner extraordinaire who kept in touch throughout the planning process and was exceptional on the day. Ian who worked tirelessly to ensure the day ran smoothly and the food was perfect, Charley who was also in charge of one bride and ensuring that everything was on point. All the staff were fantastic - polite, professional and personal.

Everyone keeps saying that this was the best wedding they have ever attended and that’s a lot of weddings between people! When we asked why, they say things like ‘the venue’, ‘the staff’, but it all came back to the inclusivity, love & joy that they felt – and you were all a part of that.

Davenport House is a stunning venue made even better by those who work there. If you want the whole package on your wedding day, we strongly recommend you book them.

Thank you to the entire Davenport House team.

Sat and Ana xx"
V3,Davenport House,"Where to begin with our beautiful venue and thanking the people who made it all happen! We got married in November at Davenport House and it was easily the best day of our lives. We chose Davenport because we wanted to host our cosy winter wedding in a big grand house in the country, with all the grandeur and class but to still feel like an intimate celebration with our family and closest friends, and it was perfect in delivering just that. It is utterly beautiful, the location was perfect and exactly what we wanted. The food was absolutely AMAZING, we had so many compliments from our guests and we are so grateful for the team in delivering such a fabulous wedding breakfast. Thank you so much to Lizzie who couldn’t do more to help us have our dream day, and Ian who delivered the best service to us and our guests (the pizza at 2am was very much appreciated)

Massive massive thank you to Charley our wedding planner, who was so so helpful throughout our wedding planning process and on the day, I can’t thank her enough. She was always there whenever I needed her, helped me so much with creating our dream day and I will be forever grateful to her for keeping me sane! Whenever I had any worries I knew she was just a phone call away, which helped me a lot when planning a wedding!

Charley, Lizzie and Ian thank you for everything - best team ever. Our day was seamless and it was all down to you and your incredible team.

Jess and Sam xx"
V3,Davenport House,"Me and my (now) wife chose Davenport House as our wedding venue in mid 2022, to get married in September 2023, and it was the best decision we could have made. We looked at a range of Georgian style manor house type venues located in Cheshire, North Wales and the West Midlands areas. It blew all of the competition away in terms of the venue aesthetics, the balance in design (i.e. period characteristics vs modern design), the impressive condition of the property for its age plus what it offered for our wedding weekend.

Staff and service - In the UK, this is usually something that is average at best - if you're lucky. At Davenport House, the service from all staff was 10/10. I honestly don't think we've ever had better service for anything. We had a wedding planner from the start (Megan), who was an absolute saint and was fundamental in making the whole wedding a success. She was also instrumental in helping us find a way for our 'little' dog Bernie to be a part of the main event. Thanks Megan!

Accommodation - The fantastic condition, design and decor for Davenport House extends to all areas of the estate. The rooms are fantastic, very big, well maintained and cleaned religiously by the venue. We had no issues or problems from all of the guests who stayed onsite over the 3 days.

Food and drink - This got a lot of deserved praise from the guests too. We got to tailor our entire menu and it worked perfectly for what we wanted for the 3 days. The oyster bar and luxurious charcuterie board went down particularly well the day before the wedding.

I could keep writing much, much more on how fantastic this venue was for our wedding. But the best advice I could give for any interested couples is to go and visit it in person and reach out to Davenport House with any questions. Our own wedding ended up becoming both perfect and the best wedding we've ever been to. Thanks guys again!"
V3,Davenport House,"Fantastic location.
Great staff.
Beautiful place to get married.
I can wait to film here again soon thanks for having me."
V3,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was a fairytale, everything we could have dreamed of and more. Lizzie and Charley were fantastic in their support, organisation and professionalism in planning our wedding. The venue is simply spectacular- breathtaking. Our guests were blown away. The day ran so smoothly it was simply perfect. The food was out of this world our guests couldn't get enough. All the staff at the house went above and beyond to ensure we were happy and having a great day. The team were also extremely supportive of last minute changes/additions. The Davenport experience was truly wonderful and I'm sad to see it end right from our initial meetings, food tasting and finally our special day. Thank you: Lizzie, Charley, Ian and all of the team for a truly memorable day for us and our guests. Mr and Mrs Kissane"
V3,Davenport House,"We got married at Davenport House in February and they provided us with the most perfect day. Lizzie, Charley, Ian and the rest of the team were the best hosts we could have hoped for. Nothing was too much to ask and the guests all commented on the hospitality shown to them. The setting is utterly gorgeous, our weather was less than favourable so we did not make the most of the grounds but this didn't matter, the house was setting enough and so atmospheric! The food was utterly AMAZING and better than most restaurant food I have eaten. The venue feels intimate and grand at the same time.
I literally cannot recommend this place enough, they gave us the wedding we had always wanted and more!"
V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge on 12 May 2023 and it was incredible. The views are gorgeous and the photo opportunities are endless with beautiful floral and green surroundings. The team were super responsive throughout the process which is really reassuring and helpful when planning a wedding, and Nelson who ran the day was just fantastic. Every single detail was thought of and they run a really slick operation. This is essential as it meant I had a lot less to think about! They put me and my partner at ease throughout. The food and service on the day was fantastic, so many of our guests said this was the best food they’ve ever had at a wedding. Highly recommend! (Photos by Costa Weddings UK)"
V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","Pembroke where super helpful and provided a lot of guidance in helpful forms and layouts. Always available for a call and very helpful. on the day, it ran super smooth and and staff where lovely. Thank yo for making it a great day!"
V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge in October 2024. The whole day was magical, including the beautiful view over the autumn trees in Richmond Park. Robert made sure everything ran perfectly and helped us to find slots in the busy wedding timetable to fit in some special moments to also reflect traditions from my husband's Dutch culture. The food was great and the staff were polite and fun. All preparation with Lucy was also smooth and done with a smile. The Pembroke Lodge team ooze experience but make every wedding feel special and really listen to your wishes for the day. Highly recommend! Thank you to the whole Pembroke Lodge team, especially Robert, Lucy, the kitchen team and the staff on the day!"
V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park",The staff has been very helpful. They have a lot of experience. Open to any suggestions and help in critical situations.
V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue than Pembroke Lodge for our summer wedding. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most gorgeous backdrop for our special day. A huge thank you to our banqueting manager, Nelson, who went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly.

The team was incredibly supportive and accommodating throughout the planning process, making it an enjoyable and stress-free experience. Their professionalism and attention to detail made all the difference, and we’re so grateful for everything they did to make our day unforgettable. Highly recommend!"
V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We got married on the 3rd of October this year, and the team made our day magical! What a smooth day. We loved every second of it! The guests loved everything, and raved about the food and organisation.
Hiring Pembroke Lodge was easy. We had a viewing where all information was shared in detail and super clear to understand and make a decision.
On the months leading up to the big day our contact was Alice. Alice is a star. Responsive, professional, and had answers and solutions to everything.
On the day, Nelson coordinated the whole thing, minute by minute, and we are forever grateful for his politeness, professionalism and high spirits. We felt safe and in good hands. I would give Pembroke Lodge way over 5 stars if I could :)"
V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","My wedding went without a hitch, thanks to the amazing team at Pembroke Lodge (special thanks to Nicola & Robert)! They made sure everything was set up perfectly on the day, exactly in the way we had requested, and then ensured the day itself went as smoothly as we could've hoped. Everything looked beautiful and the stunning views made all of our guests fall in love with the venue too."
V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had the most perfect day. The team have all been so responsive and accommodating of our every request. The venue is beautiful and we were lucky to have gorgeous sunset views. It is truly a countryside wedding but conveniently close to London, which was important for our overseas guests. The food was fantastic and staff were professional and efficient. Would recommend to anyone."
V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We recently had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge, and I cannot say enough good things about the venue, the team and manager, Robert. From the moment we started planning to the big day itself, he was absolutely incredible.

Robert went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. He was always available to answer our questions, offer solutions, and provide creative suggestions that enhanced our vision. He coordinated effortlessly with our vendors, making sure everyone was on the same page, which took so much stress off our shoulders.

On the day of the wedding, he was a true rockstar! He made sure the timeline flowed perfectly, from setting up the ceremony space to ensuring the reception transitions were seamless. His dedication and hands-on approach allowed us to enjoy every moment without worrying about a single thing.

Our wedding was a dream come true, and we owe so much of that to him and the team! Thank you, for everything you all did to make our day magical."
V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We could not have wished for a better wedding venue for our special day! Everyone went above and beyond to make sure our day goes perfectly without us having to worry about a single thing! A big shoutout to Nelson who was absolutely brilliant and made the day feel so calm and well thought through.

The food was delicious and all the team was so welcoming and super helpful on the day.

Thank you so much, we really really appreciate all the help!"
V6,The Hackney,"If you are having a wedding for under 60 people then this is your place! From start to finish the communication and planning of the wedding was seamless and took so much of the stress out of the day. The totally customisable packages that they offer really does suit anyone’s budget and more importantly regardless of what package you end up going for it is value for money. The food was delicious and it catered to everyone’s tastes including a pregnant guest, halal, vegan and lactose intolerant and was the talking point for our guests. The venue itself is stunning! Lots of exposed brick, they had recently redecorated before our wedding and the reception room that doubled up as the dance floor was styled simply but made a statement and the outdoor covered patio area was a welcome addition. The team understood our vision from the get go and they completely nailed it, all of our guests couldn’t believe it was here! I honestly can’t recommend it enough if you’re wanting a small and intimate wedding venue but still with all the class. I would say to future couples even if you think this wouldn’t be your venue please please do have a proper look because it will change your mind, I had come across this venue multiple times over the course of a year and decided to take a leap of faith and give it a chance and we’re so happy we did."
V6,The Hackney,"We can’t recommend the Hackney highly enough. They made the whole process so easy and they offer so much in-house which we took advantage of. The food was especially great - our guests were amazed “best food I’ve ever had at a wedding” and the team took great care of us during the planning stages.

They offer a very customisable service with scalable pricing. If you’re having a fairly small wedding (under 60) then you must check out The Hackney.

We had such a perfect day and we owe so much of that to the fabulous venue. Beautiful space, so professionally run."
V6,The Hackney,"We had such a brilliant experience working with the team at The Hackney. We were regularly in touch throughout the planning process and the use of the shared spreadsheet was especially handy for keeping everyone informed.
We had to postpone our wedding two days before as we were both sick with COVID, and the team were just fantastic. They waited for us to recover and then we started to talk through options again. We were able to rebook just six months after our original date, and the team were accomodating and understanding throughout the process.
The day itself was perfect. Lots of our guests commented on the quality and quantity of the food and Hugo was great at keeping everything to time. We wish we could do it all again."
V6,The Hackney,"We had our wedding reception here and wow was it amazing. Hugo, Erika and the whole team were amazing. Every single guest commented on how delicious and plentiful the food was. The staff were amazing nothing was too much to ask and all so happy.
The venue itself was decorated amazingly, given we left our wedding stationary etc up to the venue it exceeded our expectations. I was concerned about the allowed decibel level for Dj / entertainment but it was plenty loud enough. I wish I could relive the day again, if you’re thinking about booking The Hackney do it! You will not regret!"
V6,The Hackney,"We held our wedding reception at The Hackney in July and it was truly the best experience. We opted for a standing reception for our 65 guests, serving food bowl-style for a more relaxed, less formal feel. The food was absolutely delicious and there was lots of it - it just kept coming! Our guests are still raving about how good the food was months later! Lots of good drinks options too - we especially like the cocktails here!

The staff on the night were so friendly, welcoming and were amazing with our children guests too!

The Hackney is such an aesthetic venue with exposed brick walls and existing foliage which we loved, so we kept additional decorations to a minimum. We dropped our decorations to The Hackney the day before and picked them up the day after, which was super easy! We hadn’t given them too much direction with where we wanted everything placed but when we turned up to the venue on the day it was truly perfect! The staff know exactly what they’re doing and had decorated it beautifully! The outdoor seating area is a great feature too (especially for our two greyhounds who chilled out there for the majority of the reception!)

We opted for a simple Spotify playlist for our music and their sound system was good.

The wedding planning process was super easy from start to finish, with continued support and check-ins from Hugo, from the moment we booked, to the day itself! We really enjoyed the menu tasting experience earlier in the year too, which is a great touch in the build up to the big day! The planning spreadsheet was easy to use and made us feel content and relaxed, knowing that everything was under control.

Overall, we would highly recommend The Hackney to anyone looking for an affordable, dog-friendly, wedding reception venue with a laidback vibe, delicious food and lovely friendly staff! We look forward to coming back every year to celebrate our anniversary, with an espresso martini!"
V6,The Hackney,"We hosted our wedding reception with the team at the hackney in May 2023. The planning experience was straight forward and easy to book. The availability for the venue is on the website so easy to see when they have and get it booked. We went with the 5 canapés, bowl food menu, and drinks on arrival with wine through the event. The staff were brilliant and food delicious.

We loved the vibe of the venue as we wanted a bit more of a casual event, with a relaxed feel and we were able to host our 85 guests with no issues (although limited to standing event at this size, there is enough scattered seating for anyone to sit when they wanted).

In terms of decorating, we didn't feel the need to add any extra flowers as the venue was already so made up with plants and other decorations.

We did add the photo box which I highly recommend, was great fun for our friends and family and came with a memory book. People were shy at first but really got into it. We also used the recommended baker who provided a delicious cake.

Final area to mention - pricing. Wedding venues can be really expensive and daunting before you even start paying for any food or drink. Something that really attracted us to this venue was the low spacing cost and the minimum spend with it. It meant that we were able to completely customise the experience and see where the money we were spending was going. There are many different options and packages to go with, so it's up to you.

Only thing that wasn't offered was any tasting of the food beforehand which we would've liked to have done but none the less, the food was delicious so it wasn't really needed!

To finish, we loved every moment of it and hope that many others get to experience the same. Thank you very much team at the hackney!"
V6,The Hackney,"We had our reception in July. The venue was cosy and comfortably fit 30 people without feeling too crowded or too empty (we were worried it might be too empty). We managed to fit a band in, arranged mini-golf in the venue after dinner, and customize the cocktail menu with custom recipe (that we provided before hand).

One of the biggest highlights was the food. The crispy roast pork got so many complements and indeed it was tasty. But really, all the dishes were amazing (we had a tasting session prior), it was hard to choose, but the taste of each dish was still top notch on the day itself too. I heard that the supper snacks we ordered were great too but alas, I was too busy and they were snapped up instantly!

Some other details:
* We were allowed to use the small room downstairs as a private space to put our stuff. Very handy to not mess up items.
* We went with a bar tab and kept increasing the budget each time till the end of the night instead of the all-you-can-drink. From our rough calculations, it worked out about the same going for all-you-can-drink. Of course, certain folk were heavy weights and more than made it up will be different for each crowd.
* Lighting for photos came out excellent (combination of photographer and venue lighting).
* You can adjust air conditioning to suit the weather (we had ours on the warm side due to older folk not dealing with cold too well).
* Outdoor space was a pleasant change in atmosphere for those who wanted some fresh air.

What about the review from the Bride? Bride approved this review."
V6,The Hackney,"The day was fabulous - Hugo was brilliant and flexible with what we were after. The tasting day before was such a great idea and the whole experience and guidance given made planning a wedding in c.5 months so much easier. We had vegans, last minute drop outs, ridiculously hot weather, about 3 different spotify playlists, a string quartet, florists arriving in the morning and a cake that arrived the day before - the team took it all in their stride and it seemed like a breeze. Loved it all and we've had such good feedback from guests. A fabulous whirlwind.

Two very minor points for feedback - we maxed out the guest numbers (the team did advise us against it but were very accommodating despite us also throwing musicians into the mix) and it was a little too crowded pre-lunch on such a hot day. We also put some speeches in between courses (again, we were recommended against it) and that may have been a slight mistake for the dessert timings, as the tasting day was 10/10. But, it was a perfect day in a stunning venue. Loved it - thank you guys."
V6,The Hackney,"Jon and the team were absolute superstars, hosting the perfect wedding day for us. The space is beautiful, the decor is modern and perfect. They were so accommodating for any request or question we had which we really appreciated. Guests commented on how great the cocktails were! The day ran so smoothly and we had a fantastic time."
V6,The Hackney,"From the initial phonecall to the warm welcome we got when we first visited The Hackney, we knew we were in safe hands and that we’d made the perfect choice. The venue offers the most beautiful interiors - the perfect mix of cosy, intimate and modern industrial - exactly what we were looking for!

Our entire experience with The Hackney was an absolute dream -we loved the mega organised approach to planning. Something that could have been incredibly intimidating was made so straightforward with the amazing support of Hugo the General Manager who embraced all our weird and wonderful suggestions and gave expert advice on what we could do to make things even better. We left every meeting buzzing with ideas and even more excited to welcome our closest friends and family to the big day.

The quality of the food and drinks is impeccable - every single one of our guests (even the fussiest!) has commented on how much they loved it. We absolutely loved the menu tasting, even though it made the decision even harder as everything was amazing. What makes it even better for us is living close by and being able to pop into our wedding venue for a coffee or a cocktail!

I couldn't recommend The Hackney enough - I just wish we could go back and do it all again!"
V7,PYRÁ,"We held our wedding reception at Pyra. We booked the entire venue, with the upstairs loft serving as a dance floor with bar and downstairs having tables and seating for guests.  Canapes were served upstairs and a buffet dinner was served downstairs.  We lucked out with great April weather, so guests were also able to enjoy Pyra’s patio and additional space on Lonsdale Road. We were very happy with our decision to have our reception at Pyra, and many of our guests commented on how lovely the space was, how nice the staff were, and how delicious the food was.
 
The venue:
The space is gorgeous with lots of natural light upstairs.  Guests arrived at 4pm but we had the venue for the entire day, and Pyra gave our florist access earlier to set up beautiful flower arrangements and candles - it looked stunning.  Pyra set up our welcome sign and card box too. The venue also accepted delivery of our cake on the morning of the wedding which was a huge help, set it up very nicely upstairs, and cut it for us after the formal “cake cutting” shots.  We were able to coordinate with Pyra ahead of time to arrange the space how we wanted, such as how many tables we wanted downstairs and the set-up of the loft upstairs.  They even had a microphone ready for us upstairs so we could say a few words to our guests before our cake cutting. Perfect! For the evening dancing, we were able to set the disco lighting to our colour scheme, which worked really well with candles and foliage (latter 2 provided by our florist).
 
The food:
The buffet dinner was fantastic.  Pyra gave us multiple menu items to choose from and we were able to fix a nice menu that took into account guests’ dietary restrictions.  We initially booked the venue when it had a different chef and menu.  We came in a few months before our wedding to try the new menu – our dinner was delicious then and there was no dip in quality for the buffet-style served at our reception. Fionn worked with us how to plan best - because we wanted a relaxed style with a dance floor upstairs, we ended up feeding our 80 guests in two sittings downstairs, which worked perfectly. The upstairs space can seat 60 people, which didn’t work for how we planned our event, but does look really nice in photos. The late night food served around 10pm also went down very well.
 
The staff:
The staff, including the bartenders and waiters, were hardworking, friendly and very nice to guests.  Enough staff were around that guests never had to wait long for drinks.  Members of staff cut our cake for us and also boxed up the late night food for guests to bring home.  Fionn, the day-of coordinator, was on-site for our entire reception and was very helpful, even helping coordinate our midnight bus arrival.
 
Responsiveness:
Overall we were happy with the responsiveness of the venue.  It took a little while to nail down the final details of the food menu and drinks menu/bar tab but we were ultimately very happy with the result.  As the venue hosts more weddings/ larger-scale events we’d expect this will improve.

Overall:
We highly recommend Pyra for a wedding reception. We had 80 guests in total, which worked very well for the canapes/cocktail hour upstairs (4-6pm), sit-down buffet downstairs (6-8pm, split into two seatings) and dancing upstairs (8pm-midnight).  The upstairs loft was able to fit all 80 guests plus a four-piece band.  Lonsdale Road is also a charming street that provided great photo opportunities.  We looked into several other venues, and came away happy with Pyra's quote – we were able to book the venue, food (including canapes, dinner and late night food) and a generous bar tab for roughly the amount some other London venues were charging for just their space (no food or drink included). We and our guests had a fantastic time. Thanks so much to Fionn and the Pyra team :)"
V7,PYRÁ,"We had our wedding celebration at Lula. We booked the loft and restaurant for this.

Positives:
The venue is beautiful and needs minimal decoration.
The food was amazing; the chef is truly professional and everyone loved it.
They redecorated the restaurant section and added a set of couches to make it a lounge, which was beautiful.
The staff was very hardworking, professional, and lovely.

They provided us with a lounge, a wedding breakfast space and a dance floor.

Flexibility with Cake:
The bakery was scheduled to deliver and set up the cake at 16:45, but they delivered it at 09:45 instead. The Lula team handled the situation professionally by storing the cake and setting it up at the correct time. They presented the cake beautifully and assisted in cutting it into nice pieces. It could not have been more perfect.


The list of available drinks was huge, and they were happy to make custom drinks and bring in different juices if requested in advance. The event manager tried to accommodate every wish we had, and on the day we could not have hoped for more. Most of our guests said it was one of the best weddings and most beautiful venues they had ever been to.

Negatives:
Food tasting for the wedding menu was not included, which we had assumed would be, but it was given at a 50% discount. We had to sort out the floral decoration last minute, as they had initially suggested they would arrange it for us after providing a budget, but later said we needed to find our own. At times, they were a bit slow to respond, which made us anxious, but after communicating with them, this was resolved, and communication was very swift.

In conclusion:
Lula gave us the most beautiful wedding we could have dreamt of. We highly recommend them. The venue, the food, the service were amazing, and we could not have hoped for more."
V8,Sandon Manor,"We had such a special wedding at Sandon Manor, the team made every effort to make our day so so special and we will be forever grateful for that. A dream team! The day ran so smoothly and they worked so hard. The venue is unique with lots of different spaces which unfold throughout the day, which was perfect as our wedding fell on a wet and windy autumnal day. We would highly recommend Sandon Manor!"
V8,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor provided the perfect venue for our wedding. From the initial conversations and meetings with the team, we knew we were in safe hands and had made the right choice. They kept us informed with any events, made information a bit payments clear and reassured us with any query we had.
The accommodation was exceptional and fitted our requirements perfectly, with high quality finishing touches throughout to ensure our stay was as comfortable as possible.
The wedding venue was incredible! Our ceremony took place in the gorgeously modern barn with stunning draping and greenery. Following on, we had a blissful drinks reception which was on the expertly manicured lawn (with mini golf!) and sun-trap of a courtyard. We then moved onto our wedding breakfast which was held in the main barn, seating all of our guests comfortably with space for decor and extra details. Following from dinner, the part started and the club room came to life! This was absolutely the talking point of the day and our guests raved about how incredible it was! It managed to create a club-like atmosphere, whilst maintaining the vibe, albeit at a reduced volume, in the rest of the barn. The layout of the venue was important to us, as it ensured our guests never strayed too far, to keep the momentum of the day.
The team at Sandon worked superbly with all of vendors which ensured the day ran smoothly from set up to clearing. All of our vendors commented on how much they too loved working there.
The venue, the aesthetics, the staff, everything was perfect! We would absolutely recommend to anyone getting married."
V8,Sandon Manor,"We cannot recommend Sandon Manor enough. From the quality of the service, the helpfulness and friendliness of the team, the beautiful accommodation and the most amazing venue which all or guests loved partying the night away in. To make it even more special the Manor is in amazing grounds in beautiful countryside and nature reserves.
Sandon Manor made our dream come true."
V8,Sandon Manor,"I couldn't recommend Sandon Manor highly enough - from our first enquiry to our Wedding, nothing was too much trouble. The team are so friendly and easy to communicate with, very approachable and responsive. They respond to any questions immediately and having the day before to set up with Tom was fantastic. Styaying in the Manor House and Dovecote was the icing on the cake as to be with friends and family the night before and the day after was so fabulous. On the day Tom and the team were absolutely fantastic and couldn't have done more to make our special day. We couldn't have dreamt of anywhere more perfect than Sandon Manor - a huge thank you to all the staff."
V8,Sandon Manor,"If you are considering Sandon Manor for your wedding venue, I beg you: scratch it off your list now. Yes, the house and grounds are beautiful, but the people behind it are absolutely awful. They ruined our wedding experience.

I will get straight to it. Sandon Manor has a very strict policy on guests leaving the site by 11:30pm (and no one is allowed back to the Manor unless they’re official guests staying overnight). We had lots of international guests at our wedding. Many hadn’t seen each other in years and would be jetlagged - we thought they may be keen to continue chatting after 11:30pm. With this in mind, we made a booking with Sandon Village Hall via our contacts at the church (where we were attending services and later married). They granted us access to the village hall until 1am as a contingency spill over space.

We mentioned this in passing during our online meeting with one of the Sandon Manor team a month before our wedding. Within hours, I received a voicemail from the lady in charge of Village Hall bookings saying (quote) “someone at Sandon Manor is trying to throw a spanner into the works for you”. It soon transpired that they had raised an official complaint to the parish council and pressurised the village hall team into cancelling our booking. To be clear, Sandon village Hall and Sandon Manor are entirely separate entities – there is no crossover between them whatsoever, as the owner of Sandon Manor later acknowledged.

It gets worse. Gob smacked, we asked Kate – the owner of Sandon Manor – for a call to find out what was going on. She was abhorrent, trying to justify her meddling as a necessary measure to protect her wedding license (side note: with Sandon Manor it is always about the money – once your deposit is paid they care nothing for your ‘special day’; you are just another cash cow). Did she apologise for stabbing us, her clients, in the back? No, she did not. She could not even fathom how hurt we were by being completely bypassed in the communication chain and how deceitful and disrespectful this was. My husband and I were quite literally left speechless. We’ve never experienced this sort of treatment from anyone, let alone our wedding venue - to whom we were paying many thousands of pounds. Dealing with this stress in the final month of wedding prep really took its toll on us and soured things. We no longer looked forward to our day, rather dreaded what Sandon Manor might do next.

Aside from this major incident, there were many other occasions when Sandon Manor were unhelpful and unfeeling in their interactions with us:

- We enquired if it would be possible to arrange a large pizza takeaway order instead of using Sandon Manor’s caterer for our late night food. One of the team explained on a call that this wasn’t contractually possible; we acknowledged this. We then received an email saying ‘If you are unable to follow this or any other of our T&C's we would be happy to cancel your booking.’ This was less than a month before our wedding.
- We had a harpist perform in the church. We were told she wasn’t allowed to play during our drinks reception in the grounds due to potential noise complaints (an acoustic harp at 2pm in the afternoon). No other music was permitted outside the house.
- Sandon Manor is an incredibly expensive (in hindsight, grossly overpriced) venue. But we were also hit with hidden fees when booking their accommodation option - an extra £425 ‘cleaning fee’ was added to our bill.
- At the time of booking, Sandon was running a promotion waivering the £700 fee for hiring their ceremony space. As we were marrying at the church, we asked if it would please be possible to put this towards other elements of our day i.e. using their festoon string of lights in the barn (for which they charge £450). They refused.
- We were unsure about booking the 1-bed Dovecote on the grounds as - at £499 for the weekend - it was a considerable expense. While we were deciding Sandon Manor rented it out on Air BnB (to one of our guests, which made for a very awkward conversation).

To summarise, you only get one wedding day. Kate and her team absolutely ruined ours. There are so many other lovely venues in north Hertfordshire run by decent, humane people. Please prioritise your happiness and choose wisely. I wish we had."
V8,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor is a stunning wedding venue with a great team behind it. The exclusive use of the manor for the weekend was a highlight, allowing us to relax with friends and family in the lead up to and after the big day. The Sandon team were brilliant, guiding us through the planning process and ensuring everything ran smoothly on the day. We couldn't have asked for a better place and team to help us celebrate our big day."
V8,Sandon Manor,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our special day. Holly, Tom and the rest of the brilliant team made us feel welcome from day one. Special mention to Tom for making the day run so seamlessly, so professional and accommodating of all our needs.

The venue itself is stunning, located in the beautiful Hertfordshire countryside. The Manor House makes for a tremendous location to prepare, and the Dovecote suite is a nice touch: a great addition for the groom to spend the last night. We loved the small details of the characteristic main venue, with the botanical feel to the bar a great backdrop to the barn.

It’s a shame we can’t stay every week!

Dan & Suzanne"
V8,Sandon Manor,"To Holly, Louise, Tom & Kate, wow, what can we say but the biggest thank you for the best day of our lives! When we viewed the beautiful venue over two years ago we just knew instantly Sandon Manor was the one, not just because it’s stunning, but you guys are amazing! Thank you for making all our wedding dreams come true. Forever grateful and can’t wait to return to reminisce. Lots of love, the new Mr & Mrs Jakes xxx"
V8,Sandon Manor,"From the moment we visited Sandon Manor we knew this would be our wedding venue for 9 September 2023. Seeing the spectacular finish of the house carry through to the completed venue just shows the high level of attention to detail this venue had to offer.

Holly, Tom and the rest of the team filled us with confidence right from our first interactions, annd went above and beyond on the wedding weekend itself to facilitate us, our suppliers and guests. The main house, dovecote, annex and extensive grounds were a wonderful way to have close family stay with us on site, and so handy to be able to all get ready nearby the morning of.

Thank you for making our wedding weekend a truly memorable occasion, for us and our families. We all look back on this day with the happiest, sunniest memories and Sandon Manor will always have a very special place in our hearts."
V8,Sandon Manor,"We had the most amazing wedding weekend at Sandon Manor.

The venue itself is the perfect backdrop for a wedding, our photos looked amazing from every single angle. There were so many spaces to make use of throughout the day which helped things to run incredibly smoothly and meant we didn’t need to have a ‘turnaround’ during the evening. The spaces really wowed our guests and created such a lovely atmosphere. Including the ‘club room’ dance floor that had our guests dancing until the very last song!

We stayed at the Manor House for the weekend, extending our wedding into a perfect weekend retreat. The house itself is beautiful, with lots of different areas for everyone to relax, and the perfect peaceful location to chill the night before the big day!

From our first viewing to checking out the day after our wedding, the Sandon staff were attentive, friendly and helped us feel relaxed and looked after throughout an otherwise overwhelming process. We’d highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for a beautiful, peaceful and unique wedding venue!"
