V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow what can I say, Brinsop is an absolutely stunning wedding venue with heaps of character and so many options of places for the ceremony and to do things. We fell in love with it as soon as we saw it and knew it was where we wanted to get married.

Right from the start, the Brinsop team were so helpful and accommodating. From giving an virtual tour then showing us around in person, Issy and the team were fantastic right the way through. Nothing was a hassle, no request too difficult and they were incredibly professional and responsive throughout the whole process.

We loved that Brinsop is an exclusive venue with accommodation on site so we could stay with the bridal party and our immediate family. All the rooms are unique and have so much character and it's fun exploring the whole place. You feel like you are in the middle of nowhere, in nature with swans, ducks and birds all around.

Throughout our planning process, Issy and the team helped us every step of the way, being incredibly flexible in managing our requests and really trying to create our vision. They even got their team to make a giant jenga that we could use on the day! They helped to create the most perfect bespoke wedding breakfast and canapes menu, and seemed so positive and excited to be part of our special day and experience.

Arriving at the venue, Issy and the team were ready and had everything prepared and ready to go. It made the process so smooth for us and meant we could really enjoy the day without any stress. Issy coordinated perfectly with all of our vendors and it really felt like she and the whole team were so happy for us and wanted to be part of our day which was amazing. Our guests commented on how friendly and responsive all the staff were and it really made the experience extra special.

I wouldn't change anything about the day and it was perfect. I would absolutely recommend Brinsop as a wedding venue and all the staff who are really invested in helping deliver your vision. Thank you so so much to the whole team for making this a day that we will look back on for many years to come with amazing memories."
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow, what a perfect day we had! It really went without a hitch and that was thanks to Nina and all the staff at Brinsop. The team worked seamlessly to ensure the day was as perfect as could be, and it really was! The wedding was booked over 2 years in advance and the staff were so accommodating with all my questions, planning and site visits, they couldn’t do more to support us. Special thanks to our coordinator Nina who was a delight to work with and a credit to Brinsop. Everyone that attended agreed at how beautiful the venue and grounds were, it was a wedding people won’t forget! 10/10 would recommend to anyone!"
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"It's taken me quite a while to get round to writing this review, because sadly it's quite a bittersweet one.

We were married last year on 15 June and Brinsop was our chosen venue for both our ceremony and reception. We were first attracted to brinsop by the accomodation, meaning our loved ones could stay on-site, especially my grandparents which was so important to me.

The home itself is absolutely beautiful, including ivy cottage which myself and my mum stayed in the night before the big day. It really was a picture perfect setting, and looking down from the bridal suite seeing the ceremony space being set up on the Wordsworth lawn was honestly magical. Id dreamed of an outdoor wedding on that lawn, and we were so grateful the weather cleared so we could have it. The team really did wait till the latest they could to ask us to make a call on an inside or outside wedding (despite being June, it was a gloomy day to start) which I really appreciated!

Another amazing part of hiring brinsop was the after hours space we were able to enjoy until 2am with our house guests. The games room was absolute fantastic and meant that if you wanted to go to bed you could, but you could also stay up, party and play pool. I really do think this was a highlight for our guests and would recommend massively if you can spare some budget.

On the night of the wedding, myself and my new husband actually stayed in one glamping tents which we absolutely loved. The groundsman was on site until we were ready to leave the games room, and he then took us up to our tent in one of the buggies, making sure we had plenty of blankets and even stopping off for some bottles of water for us. This was really special, and can't thank him enough.

Hugo Spritz!! Having hugos at both our welcome drinks and drinks reception after the ceremony was amazing. I'm not a fan of prosecco myself and Mark and the team made it possible for us to have Hugo's all round. We even sneaked some up to the bridal suite to have before the ceremony (thanks Nadia!). Our guests loved them, and the amount of people that have told me they now need them at their own wedding is crazy!

Onto the not so good - sadly it all started to go a little downhill when we moved things into the knot barn for our wedding breakfast. Sitting on the top table, I could see that guests at the top of the second rows of long tables didn't really even have a seat around the table and were just kind of plonked on. The seating plan hadn't been followed, and I don't think there were even enough tables laid for the service to be comfortable for people because there was a dance floor at the end of the barn (which I did not ask for).

It was quickly also brought to my attention, that one of our guests had had to put her child on her lap in order to remove the high chair so people had more space. We also lost about 5 napkins with them setting on fire from the candles because everything was just way too cramped.

I asked to speak to catering, and asked if there was anything that they could do. I was told 'well sure, if you want the whole thing to be late'. In truth I shouldn't have even had to broach this myself, as it should have been sorted by the coordination team.

The tables weren't changed, even after they'd said they'd sort after the first course and yet the whole meal still ran late. We've had so much feedback about people not having enough food, food not being easy to access on the sharing platters etc and honestly when you've waited so long for a day and had spent 25k on the venue and food alone, it really has been heartbreaking to hear. I do sometimes question why people still bring it up (even now, people talk about the dining) when it clearly upset me so much.

Whilst writing this review my husband asked my what we had for evening food - we didn't get any. It was left unannounced on a back table. I don't know what I was expecting, just not that.

The next morning, the houseguests were asked to come down to breakfast for 9am (it was on a note in the room) but as we were in the glamping area, we walked past the knot barn just before 8.30 and the food was already out. We ran down to the house to hurry everyone up, and by which time everyone arrived it had been sitting there for 20plus mins going cold.

My biggest upset was that when I fed all of the above back to brinsop, feeling pretty deflated about the catering, I was told they'd pass my feedback on and heard absolutely nothing back. 25k total with over 10k on food and drinks to hear absolutely nothing, and this was 9 months ago. I'm not saying this in would happen to anyone else, but really - it shouldn't have happened to us either."
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our wedding! From start to finish, everything at Brinsop was flawless. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most magical backdrop for our special day. Our guests were blown away by the beautiful venue, the warm atmosphere, and the seamless coordination. Every detail was taken care of, and we felt so well looked after. The team was incredible, professional, friendly, and attentive. On the day itself, they ensured everything ran smoothly, allowing us to truly enjoy every moment. A special mention goes to our amazing wedding coordinator Nina!"
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We had our wedding on New Year's Eve 2024 at Brinsop, and it was more perfect that we could have ever hoped for. The venue itself is stunning, with beautiful spacious rooms which slept over 40 of our guests. Our coordinator, Nina, was incredible and so supportive on the day - she kept everything running so smoothly and everything went by without a glitch. The food and drink managers Mark and Amy did the most incredible job - nothing was ever too much, they were so attentive, and the chefs the most stunning meal after we gave them a fairly vague brief of 'curry'! We had the most perfect day and we're so incredibly grateful to Brinsop and the team."
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,Brinsop Court is pure magic—an unforgettable venue with an incredible team!
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We were lucky enough to have our wedding at Brinsop Court in December, and it was an absolutely spectacular day. We fell in love with Brinsop as soon we set our eyes on the beautiful manor and surrounding gardens. Cate, Amy, Mark and the rest of the wonderful staff at Brinsop really go the extra mile to make you feel special, and are extremely flexible with requests in order to make your day feel more special. We honestly felt like there was no request too big leading up to the day and they really made us feel extremely comfortable leading up to the day.
On the day, Cate and her team were well on hand to help us with setting up everything and she had everything under control when there were a few hiccups. The day itself was absolutely magical, and that wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for everyone at Brinsop working extremely hard to ensure that everything went to plan and as smoothly as it could.
Thank you to everyone at Brinsop for making us feel at ease and ensuring that our wedding was an amazing day."
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Brinsop, the perfect wedding venue! We got married at Brinsop in December and I can honestly say it was everything we could have hoped for and more. We found out about the venue through Hitched and was one of only two venues that we visited but as soon as we got the house we knew it was the one. We fell in love with everything about it and it was fair to say that our guests agreed with us with many saying it was the nicest venue they’d been to. We had the wonderful Nina as our coordinator and she was brilliant! Nothing was too much trouble and we had constant communication with her in the build up which helped our stress levels no end. The same can be said for all of the staff who were brilliant throughout and allowed us to have the best day of our lives with everything running seamlessly. A special mention must be given to Amy and the catering staff who put on such an incredible menu (including the tasting session that provided some of the best food we’d ever had) and ensured that the food has been one of the main things that people have mentioned to us since the wedding! We had our ceremony in the Banqueting Hall which provided the perfect setting, especially with it being a winter wedding, as it really added to the cosy atmosphere and the lounge areas/games room were perfect for the drink’s reception. We would have loved to have also had it in the courtyard, but the temperatures meant that the lounge with the fireplace was a far more appealing option on the day. We then had the wedding breakfast and reception in the knot barn which was decorated beautifully and was the perfect place for the party in the evening. Overall we really can’t thank everyone at Brinsop enough for making our day what it was, we can honestly say that we have been made to feel part of the family and already can’t wait to hopefully come back to stay in one of the cottages for our first anniversary!"
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Where do I start!!
Brinop Court is the most stunning venue, it was the first venue we visited and instantly fell in love! Theres so much history to the house and we were treated like family every time we visited before the wedding and it literally felt like home the whole weekend of the wedding, my guests also agreed!!

A special thank you to Issy our coodinator who went above and beyond ti make sure everything was perfect for us. It was so easy to plan and nothing was too much to ask, even arranging our dog to be our ring bearer!! When they say Brinsop is dog friendly they really mean it!!!

What a place, what a day!! Thank you so much everyone, you all made our day perfect and it really was the best day of our lives♥️"
V1,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We got married at the gorgeous Brinsop in October this year. It’s hard to put into words how amazing the whole experience was. We honestly had the best day of our lives!!!

We fell in love with Brinsop during our first visit back in December 2022. We knew almost immediately that Brinsop was the venue we were looking for! From the outside the venue looked like a painting - from the picturesque views of the countryside, to the swans swimming on the moat! The manor house itself has so much character, and has a lovely homely feel to it as you walk around it. Our guests were equally blown away by the venue!

A big thing for us was that it’s dog friendly, which meant we could have our two dogs join us on our special day, it wouldn’t have been the same without them there! They had so much fun walking around the grounds and greeting all of our guests!

Nina, our coordinator, and her team were always available to answer any of our questions in the run up to the day. This really put us at ease, knowing we were in safe hands. On the day, Nina and the team made sure everything ran smoothly and went above and beyond to ensure our guests were looked after. A shout out to Amy who heads up catering and Mark who manages the bar. The food and drinks were absolutely fantastic!

I highly recommend this venue! There’s a reason Brinsop is an award winning venue - and when you visit it’s not hard to see why. We are already looking forward to going back there for a date night next year! Thanks for everything Team Brinsop!

V2,The Manor at Bickley,"The Manor is the perfect venue for weddings! When our wedding venue fell through 4 months before the big day, I stumbled onto the Manor at Bickley and spoke to Craig. He was most helpful and kind and went above and beyond to make sure our wedding went ahead.

We hired the venue for our two day wedding and the staff were helpful and accommodating from start to finish. All of our guests were awed by the beautiful well kept grounds and the excellent service. We can’t thank the staff enough for making our wedding dreams a reality. They thought of every detail from bringing us champagne after our civil ceremony to making sure we had our card box at the end of the night! We are excited to head back to celebrate our anniversary there!"
V2,The Manor at Bickley,"Myself and my Husband chose this venue for our wedding last week and we can’t sing The Manor’s praises enough. From our very first enquiry, to the first viewing of the venue, right though until the big day, the staff at the manor have been nothing short of brilliant! Each staff member we came across was polite and accommodating. Special mention to Craig and Vicky with whom we did most of our liaising throughout the months leading up until our wedding. Craig and Vicky were super helpful, responsive and went above and beyond to make sure that we could have the day of our dreams. Even with last minute changes due to the weather, Craig who was just incredible throughout, managed to help us sort a backup plan so our day would still go ahead seamlessly.

The rooms at the manor were spacious and modern, giving us and our wedding party lots of space for photographers and videographers to capture the special moments on our wedding morning.

The lodge that was used for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready was fabulous. The manor was very flexible in giving us early access so we could get ready on time.

The grand marquee was definitely grand! Very spacious and when decorated looked like something out of a fairytale! lots of kitchen space, a huge bar and fantastic overhead speakers for the party!

The manor was super flexible to our needs regarding access, start times, outsourcing our vendors and much more. The venue is beautiful and spacious with options for outdoor and indoor events and entertainment. The grounds were absolutely beautiful, so many lovely spots for photos not only for us as the bride and groom but for guests too!

A very special thank you to our point of contact throughout, Craig. From our first meeting, he was charming, bubbly and made us feel super welcome. He reassured us that he has experience in African/Caribbean weddings and that our wedding day would amazing and it was. He was attentive and always let us know that he was only a phone call or e-mail away and was always quick to respond and answer any questions we had.

All in all, we had the most beautiful day at The manor and we would definitely recommend this venue for a wedding or other events.

V2,The Manor at Bickley,"We hired The Manor at Bickley for my daughters wedding. Got a brilliant service from the venue. Everything was set accordingly, as per floor plan. Our guests were loved the venue grounds/facilities and the overall wedding set up.
Thank you to everyone at Bickley."
V2,The Manor at Bickley,"A warm and friendly service from the very helpful staff, a feeling that it is your own house! The food was amazing and the atmosphere made us and our guests feel fantastic."
V3,Davenport House,We are so pleased we chose Davenport House for our wedding reception. Charley and the team were so helpful and thoughtful. Putting canapés behind the bar for us and making sure everything ran so smoothly. I am obsessed with the stunning house and grounds and it was absolutely perfect! Thank you so much for making our day so special!!
V3,Davenport House,"Davenport House is a STUNNING wedding venue so how could we not have it for our big day!?

The staff were exceptional! From the moment we booked through to our big day, we had an absolute blast and could not thank each member of staff enough! Special shout out to Jared (hopefully spelt right, haha!) who made sure we were fed, watered and ensured we took 5 minutes to ourselves every moment we could - Also even saved us slices of pie wedding cake before we went to bed!

Our guests have said they have never been to a wedding so spectacular, with the most amazing food and amazing staff so could not have been happier having Davenport as our venue! 🩷"
V3,Davenport House,"I just wanted to write to say a huge, enormous thank you to Charley and all the team at Davenport House. We still can’t believe how perfect our day was, and lots of our guests have told us it’s the best wedding they’ve ever been to. The team were all a huge part of making that happen. It was incredibly seamless and well planned on the day, meaning we genuinely didn’t have to think about a thing, except for enjoying ourselves. The day ran to schedule perfectly and even certain touches we didn’t know or expect to happen were planned by you and the team, which made the day even more special. Thank you so much for giving us our dream wedding day. We can’t wait to see the full set of pictures and the video now to relive it all!"
V3,Davenport House,"Without doubt the best day of our lives. From start to finish, Davenport has exceeded expectations. From the very first impression of the venue during the open day, the incredible food tasting evening, all the way through to the day itself, including the support and preparation leading up to it. It was really important to us to pick a venue that not only ticked the fairytale box, but also come with the complete support of a wedding planner, due to our busy jobs. We were lucky enough to have Charley as ours. She really took the time to listen and get to know us, to ensure the day was tailored to exactly what we wanted. We even had our own cocktail designed, which went down an absolute storm on the day! She considered every little detail, constantly putting our minds at ease, which made the whole process so easy and enjoyable. Honestly the day couldn’t have gone smoother, any anxiety or stress faded immediately as soon as we got to the venue. It was simply perfect. So many of our guests were complimentary of just how beautiful the venue is and just how well organised the day was, and that is the perfect way to summarise Davenport. Any prospective couples thinking of selecting Davenport as their venue, hesitate no further. It will be a day you never knew was possible! We cannot thank you enough Charley and the Davenport team, if only we could live the day over and over again"
V3,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was amazing. When looking for a venue we weren't just looking for something wow, we needed to have people who were enthused and passionate about their work - we found that at Davenport House.

From our first phone call & meeting with Lizzie and Tallulah, we knew this was the place for us. Having two brides wasn’t an issue; combining British, Asian and Spanish cultures - wasn't an issue; having brides enter together – wasn’t an issue. Nothing was an issue. At Davenport House, we got it all – a picturesque venue and the best team of staff anyone could ever wish for. All our external suppliers have commented what a fantastic venue you are. All out guests have said that the service and attention to detail was second to none. The thoughtful touches like hiring a Spanish speaking waiter for the table which spoke very little English ensured that everyone felt welcomed. Guests with dietary requirements didn't feel they got a second rate meal or they were an afterthought - the food for all throughout the day was exceptional. The rooms / cottages where our guests and we stayed, spotless and comfortable. The thought behind adding some cheese and Spanish ham to the morning breakfast - so sweet!

Special shout out to Megan - wedding planner extraordinaire who kept in touch throughout the planning process and was exceptional on the day. Ian who worked tirelessly to ensure the day ran smoothly and the food was perfect, Charley who was also in charge of one bride and ensuring that everything was on point. All the staff were fantastic - polite, professional and personal.

Everyone keeps saying that this was the best wedding they have ever attended and that’s a lot of weddings between people! When we asked why, they say things like ‘the venue’, ‘the staff’, but it all came back to the inclusivity, love & joy that they felt – and you were all a part of that.

Davenport House is a stunning venue made even better by those who work there. If you want the whole package on your wedding day, we strongly recommend you book them.

Thank you to the entire Davenport House team.

Sat and Ana xx"
V3,Davenport House,"Where to begin with our beautiful venue and thanking the people who made it all happen! We got married in November at Davenport House and it was easily the best day of our lives. We chose Davenport because we wanted to host our cosy winter wedding in a big grand house in the country, with all the grandeur and class but to still feel like an intimate celebration with our family and closest friends, and it was perfect in delivering just that. It is utterly beautiful, the location was perfect and exactly what we wanted. The food was absolutely AMAZING, we had so many compliments from our guests and we are so grateful for the team in delivering such a fabulous wedding breakfast. Thank you so much to Lizzie who couldn’t do more to help us have our dream day, and Ian who delivered the best service to us and our guests (the pizza at 2am was very much appreciated)

Massive massive thank you to Charley our wedding planner, who was so so helpful throughout our wedding planning process and on the day, I can’t thank her enough. She was always there whenever I needed her, helped me so much with creating our dream day and I will be forever grateful to her for keeping me sane! Whenever I had any worries I knew she was just a phone call away, which helped me a lot when planning a wedding!

Charley, Lizzie and Ian thank you for everything - best team ever. Our day was seamless and it was all down to you and your incredible team.

Jess and Sam xx"
V3,Davenport House,"Me and my (now) wife chose Davenport House as our wedding venue in mid 2022, to get married in September 2023, and it was the best decision we could have made. We looked at a range of Georgian style manor house type venues located in Cheshire, North Wales and the West Midlands areas. It blew all of the competition away in terms of the venue aesthetics, the balance in design (i.e. period characteristics vs modern design), the impressive condition of the property for its age plus what it offered for our wedding weekend.

Staff and service - In the UK, this is usually something that is average at best - if you're lucky. At Davenport House, the service from all staff was 10/10. I honestly don't think we've ever had better service for anything. We had a wedding planner from the start (Megan), who was an absolute saint and was fundamental in making the whole wedding a success. She was also instrumental in helping us find a way for our 'little' dog Bernie to be a part of the main event. Thanks Megan!

Accommodation - The fantastic condition, design and decor for Davenport House extends to all areas of the estate. The rooms are fantastic, very big, well maintained and cleaned religiously by the venue. We had no issues or problems from all of the guests who stayed onsite over the 3 days.

Food and drink - This got a lot of deserved praise from the guests too. We got to tailor our entire menu and it worked perfectly for what we wanted for the 3 days. The oyster bar and luxurious charcuterie board went down particularly well the day before the wedding.

I could keep writing much, much more on how fantastic this venue was for our wedding. But the best advice I could give for any interested couples is to go and visit it in person and reach out to Davenport House with any questions. Our own wedding ended up becoming both perfect and the best wedding we've ever been to. Thanks guys again!"
V3,Davenport House,"Fantastic location.
Great staff.
Beautiful place to get married.
I can wait to film here again soon thanks for having me."
V3,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was a fairytale, everything we could have dreamed of and more. Lizzie and Charley were fantastic in their support, organisation and professionalism in planning our wedding. The venue is simply spectacular- breathtaking. Our guests were blown away. The day ran so smoothly it was simply perfect. The food was out of this world our guests couldn't get enough. All the staff at the house went above and beyond to ensure we were happy and having a great day. The team were also extremely supportive of last minute changes/additions. The Davenport experience was truly wonderful and I'm sad to see it end right from our initial meetings, food tasting and finally our special day. Thank you: Lizzie, Charley, Ian and all of the team for a truly memorable day for us and our guests. Mr and Mrs Kissane"
V3,Davenport House,"We got married at Davenport House in February and they provided us with the most perfect day. Lizzie, Charley, Ian and the rest of the team were the best hosts we could have hoped for. Nothing was too much to ask and the guests all commented on the hospitality shown to them. The setting is utterly gorgeous, our weather was less than favourable so we did not make the most of the grounds but this didn't matter, the house was setting enough and so atmospheric! The food was utterly AMAZING and better than most restaurant food I have eaten. The venue feels intimate and grand at the same time.
I literally cannot recommend this place enough, they gave us the wedding we had always wanted and more!"

V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge on 12 May 2023 and it was incredible. The views are gorgeous and the photo opportunities are endless with beautiful floral and green surroundings. The team were super responsive throughout the process which is really reassuring and helpful when planning a wedding, and Nelson who ran the day was just fantastic. Every single detail was thought of and they run a really slick operation. This is essential as it meant I had a lot less to think about! They put me and my partner at ease throughout. The food and service on the day was fantastic, so many of our guests said this was the best food they’ve ever had at a wedding. Highly recommend! (Photos by Costa Weddings UK)"

V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge in October 2024. The whole day was magical, including the beautiful view over the autumn trees in Richmond Park. Robert made sure everything ran perfectly and helped us to find slots in the busy wedding timetable to fit in some special moments to also reflect traditions from my husband's Dutch culture. The food was great and the staff were polite and fun. All preparation with Lucy was also smooth and done with a smile. The Pembroke Lodge team ooze experience but make every wedding feel special and really listen to your wishes for the day. Highly recommend! Thank you to the whole Pembroke Lodge team, especially Robert, Lucy, the kitchen team and the staff on the day!"
V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park",The staff has been very helpful. They have a lot of experience. Open to any suggestions and help in critical situations.
V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue than Pembroke Lodge for our summer wedding. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most gorgeous backdrop for our special day. A huge thank you to our banqueting manager, Nelson, who went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly.

The team was incredibly supportive and accommodating throughout the planning process, making it an enjoyable and stress-free experience. Their professionalism and attention to detail made all the difference, and we’re so grateful for everything they did to make our day unforgettable. Highly recommend!"
V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We got married on the 3rd of October this year, and the team made our day magical! What a smooth day. We loved every second of it! The guests loved everything, and raved about the food and organisation.
Hiring Pembroke Lodge was easy. We had a viewing where all information was shared in detail and super clear to understand and make a decision.
On the months leading up to the big day our contact was Alice. Alice is a star. Responsive, professional, and had answers and solutions to everything.
On the day, Nelson coordinated the whole thing, minute by minute, and we are forever grateful for his politeness, professionalism and high spirits. We felt safe and in good hands. I would give Pembroke Lodge way over 5 stars if I could :)"
V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","My wedding went without a hitch, thanks to the amazing team at Pembroke Lodge (special thanks to Nicola & Robert)! They made sure everything was set up perfectly on the day, exactly in the way we had requested, and then ensured the day itself went as smoothly as we could've hoped. Everything looked beautiful and the stunning views made all of our guests fall in love with the venue too."
V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had the most perfect day. The team have all been so responsive and accommodating of our every request. The venue is beautiful and we were lucky to have gorgeous sunset views. It is truly a countryside wedding but conveniently close to London, which was important for our overseas guests. The food was fantastic and staff were professional and efficient. Would recommend to anyone."
V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We recently had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge, and I cannot say enough good things about the venue, the team and manager, Robert. From the moment we started planning to the big day itself, he was absolutely incredible.

Robert went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. He was always available to answer our questions, offer solutions, and provide creative suggestions that enhanced our vision. He coordinated effortlessly with our vendors, making sure everyone was on the same page, which took so much stress off our shoulders.

On the day of the wedding, he was a true rockstar! He made sure the timeline flowed perfectly, from setting up the ceremony space to ensuring the reception transitions were seamless. His dedication and hands-on approach allowed us to enjoy every moment without worrying about a single thing.

Our wedding was a dream come true, and we owe so much of that to him and the team! Thank you, for everything you all did to make our day magical."
V5,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We could not have wished for a better wedding venue for our special day! Everyone went above and beyond to make sure our day goes perfectly without us having to worry about a single thing! A big shoutout to Nelson who was absolutely brilliant and made the day feel so calm and well thought through.

The food was delicious and all the team was so welcoming and super helpful on the day.

Thank you so much, we really really appreciate all the help!"
V6,The Hackney,"If you are having a wedding for under 60 people then this is your place! From start to finish the communication and planning of the wedding was seamless and took so much of the stress out of the day. The totally customisable packages that they offer really does suit anyone’s budget and more importantly regardless of what package you end up going for it is value for money. The food was delicious and it catered to everyone’s tastes including a pregnant guest, halal, vegan and lactose intolerant and was the talking point for our guests. The venue itself is stunning! Lots of exposed brick, they had recently redecorated before our wedding and the reception room that doubled up as the dance floor was styled simply but made a statement and the outdoor covered patio area was a welcome addition. The team understood our vision from the get go and they completely nailed it, all of our guests couldn’t believe it was here! I honestly can’t recommend it enough if you’re wanting a small and intimate wedding venue but still with all the class. I would say to future couples even if you think this wouldn’t be your venue please please do have a proper look because it will change your mind, I had come across this venue multiple times over the course of a year and decided to take a leap of faith and give it a chance and we’re so happy we did."
V6,The Hackney,"We can’t recommend the Hackney highly enough. They made the whole process so easy and they offer so much in-house which we took advantage of. The food was especially great - our guests were amazed “best food I’ve ever had at a wedding” and the team took great care of us during the planning stages.

They offer a very customisable service with scalable pricing. If you’re having a fairly small wedding (under 60) then you must check out The Hackney.

We had such a perfect day and we owe so much of that to the fabulous venue. Beautiful space, so professionally run."
V6,The Hackney,"We had such a brilliant experience working with the team at The Hackney. We were regularly in touch throughout the planning process and the use of the shared spreadsheet was especially handy for keeping everyone informed.
We had to postpone our wedding two days before as we were both sick with COVID, and the team were just fantastic. They waited for us to recover and then we started to talk through options again. We were able to rebook just six months after our original date, and the team were accomodating and understanding throughout the process.
The day itself was perfect. Lots of our guests commented on the quality and quantity of the food and Hugo was great at keeping everything to time. We wish we could do it all again."
V6,The Hackney,"We had our wedding reception here and wow was it amazing. Hugo, Erika and the whole team were amazing. Every single guest commented on how delicious and plentiful the food was. The staff were amazing nothing was too much to ask and all so happy.
The venue itself was decorated amazingly, given we left our wedding stationary etc up to the venue it exceeded our expectations. I was concerned about the allowed decibel level for Dj / entertainment but it was plenty loud enough. I wish I could relive the day again, if you’re thinking about booking The Hackney do it! You will not regret!"
V6,The Hackney,"We held our wedding reception at The Hackney in July and it was truly the best experience. We opted for a standing reception for our 65 guests, serving food bowl-style for a more relaxed, less formal feel. The food was absolutely delicious and there was lots of it - it just kept coming! Our guests are still raving about how good the food was months later! Lots of good drinks options too - we especially like the cocktails here!

The staff on the night were so friendly, welcoming and were amazing with our children guests too!

The Hackney is such an aesthetic venue with exposed brick walls and existing foliage which we loved, so we kept additional decorations to a minimum. We dropped our decorations to The Hackney the day before and picked them up the day after, which was super easy! We hadn’t given them too much direction with where we wanted everything placed but when we turned up to the venue on the day it was truly perfect! The staff know exactly what they’re doing and had decorated it beautifully! The outdoor seating area is a great feature too (especially for our two greyhounds who chilled out there for the majority of the reception!)

We opted for a simple Spotify playlist for our music and their sound system was good.

The wedding planning process was super easy from start to finish, with continued support and check-ins from Hugo, from the moment we booked, to the day itself! We really enjoyed the menu tasting experience earlier in the year too, which is a great touch in the build up to the big day! The planning spreadsheet was easy to use and made us feel content and relaxed, knowing that everything was under control.

Overall, we would highly recommend The Hackney to anyone looking for an affordable, dog-friendly, wedding reception venue with a laidback vibe, delicious food and lovely friendly staff! We look forward to coming back every year to celebrate our anniversary, with an espresso martini!"
V6,The Hackney,"We hosted our wedding reception with the team at the hackney in May 2023. The planning experience was straight forward and easy to book. The availability for the venue is on the website so easy to see when they have and get it booked. We went with the 5 canapés, bowl food menu, and drinks on arrival with wine through the event. The staff were brilliant and food delicious.

We loved the vibe of the venue as we wanted a bit more of a casual event, with a relaxed feel and we were able to host our 85 guests with no issues (although limited to standing event at this size, there is enough scattered seating for anyone to sit when they wanted).

In terms of decorating, we didn't feel the need to add any extra flowers as the venue was already so made up with plants and other decorations.

We did add the photo box which I highly recommend, was great fun for our friends and family and came with a memory book. People were shy at first but really got into it. We also used the recommended baker who provided a delicious cake.

Final area to mention - pricing. Wedding venues can be really expensive and daunting before you even start paying for any food or drink. Something that really attracted us to this venue was the low spacing cost and the minimum spend with it. It meant that we were able to completely customise the experience and see where the money we were spending was going. There are many different options and packages to go with, so it's up to you.

Only thing that wasn't offered was any tasting of the food beforehand which we would've liked to have done but none the less, the food was delicious so it wasn't really needed!

To finish, we loved every moment of it and hope that many others get to experience the same. Thank you very much team at the hackney!"
V6,The Hackney,"We had our reception in July. The venue was cosy and comfortably fit 30 people without feeling too crowded or too empty (we were worried it might be too empty). We managed to fit a band in, arranged mini-golf in the venue after dinner, and customize the cocktail menu with custom recipe (that we provided before hand).

One of the biggest highlights was the food. The crispy roast pork got so many complements and indeed it was tasty. But really, all the dishes were amazing (we had a tasting session prior), it was hard to choose, but the taste of each dish was still top notch on the day itself too. I heard that the supper snacks we ordered were great too but alas, I was too busy and they were snapped up instantly!

Some other details:
* We were allowed to use the small room downstairs as a private space to put our stuff. Very handy to not mess up items.
* We went with a bar tab and kept increasing the budget each time till the end of the night instead of the all-you-can-drink. From our rough calculations, it worked out about the same going for all-you-can-drink. Of course, certain folk were heavy weights and more than made it up will be different for each crowd.
* Lighting for photos came out excellent (combination of photographer and venue lighting).
* You can adjust air conditioning to suit the weather (we had ours on the warm side due to older folk not dealing with cold too well).
* Outdoor space was a pleasant change in atmosphere for those who wanted some fresh air.

What about the review from the Bride? Bride approved this review."
V6,The Hackney,"The day was fabulous - Hugo was brilliant and flexible with what we were after. The tasting day before was such a great idea and the whole experience and guidance given made planning a wedding in c.5 months so much easier. We had vegans, last minute drop outs, ridiculously hot weather, about 3 different spotify playlists, a string quartet, florists arriving in the morning and a cake that arrived the day before - the team took it all in their stride and it seemed like a breeze. Loved it all and we've had such good feedback from guests. A fabulous whirlwind.

Two very minor points for feedback - we maxed out the guest numbers (the team did advise us against it but were very accommodating despite us also throwing musicians into the mix) and it was a little too crowded pre-lunch on such a hot day. We also put some speeches in between courses (again, we were recommended against it) and that may have been a slight mistake for the dessert timings, as the tasting day was 10/10. But, it was a perfect day in a stunning venue. Loved it - thank you guys."
V6,The Hackney,"Jon and the team were absolute superstars, hosting the perfect wedding day for us. The space is beautiful, the decor is modern and perfect. They were so accommodating for any request or question we had which we really appreciated. Guests commented on how great the cocktails were! The day ran so smoothly and we had a fantastic time."
V6,The Hackney,"From the initial phonecall to the warm welcome we got when we first visited The Hackney, we knew we were in safe hands and that we’d made the perfect choice. The venue offers the most beautiful interiors - the perfect mix of cosy, intimate and modern industrial - exactly what we were looking for!

Our entire experience with The Hackney was an absolute dream -we loved the mega organised approach to planning. Something that could have been incredibly intimidating was made so straightforward with the amazing support of Hugo the General Manager who embraced all our weird and wonderful suggestions and gave expert advice on what we could do to make things even better. We left every meeting buzzing with ideas and even more excited to welcome our closest friends and family to the big day.

The quality of the food and drinks is impeccable - every single one of our guests (even the fussiest!) has commented on how much they loved it. We absolutely loved the menu tasting, even though it made the decision even harder as everything was amazing. What makes it even better for us is living close by and being able to pop into our wedding venue for a coffee or a cocktail!

I couldn't recommend The Hackney enough - I just wish we could go back and do it all again!"
V7,PYRÁ,"We held our wedding reception at Pyra. We booked the entire venue, with the upstairs loft serving as a dance floor with bar and downstairs having tables and seating for guests.  Canapes were served upstairs and a buffet dinner was served downstairs.  We lucked out with great April weather, so guests were also able to enjoy Pyra’s patio and additional space on Lonsdale Road. We were very happy with our decision to have our reception at Pyra, and many of our guests commented on how lovely the space was, how nice the staff were, and how delicious the food was.
 
The venue:
The space is gorgeous with lots of natural light upstairs.  Guests arrived at 4pm but we had the venue for the entire day, and Pyra gave our florist access earlier to set up beautiful flower arrangements and candles - it looked stunning.  Pyra set up our welcome sign and card box too. The venue also accepted delivery of our cake on the morning of the wedding which was a huge help, set it up very nicely upstairs, and cut it for us after the formal “cake cutting” shots.  We were able to coordinate with Pyra ahead of time to arrange the space how we wanted, such as how many tables we wanted downstairs and the set-up of the loft upstairs.  They even had a microphone ready for us upstairs so we could say a few words to our guests before our cake cutting. Perfect! For the evening dancing, we were able to set the disco lighting to our colour scheme, which worked really well with candles and foliage (latter 2 provided by our florist).
 
The food:
The buffet dinner was fantastic.  Pyra gave us multiple menu items to choose from and we were able to fix a nice menu that took into account guests’ dietary restrictions.  We initially booked the venue when it had a different chef and menu.  We came in a few months before our wedding to try the new menu – our dinner was delicious then and there was no dip in quality for the buffet-style served at our reception. Fionn worked with us how to plan best - because we wanted a relaxed style with a dance floor upstairs, we ended up feeding our 80 guests in two sittings downstairs, which worked perfectly. The upstairs space can seat 60 people, which didn’t work for how we planned our event, but does look really nice in photos. The late night food served around 10pm also went down very well.
 
The staff:
The staff, including the bartenders and waiters, were hardworking, friendly and very nice to guests.  Enough staff were around that guests never had to wait long for drinks.  Members of staff cut our cake for us and also boxed up the late night food for guests to bring home.  Fionn, the day-of coordinator, was on-site for our entire reception and was very helpful, even helping coordinate our midnight bus arrival.
 
Responsiveness:
Overall we were happy with the responsiveness of the venue.  It took a little while to nail down the final details of the food menu and drinks menu/bar tab but we were ultimately very happy with the result.  As the venue hosts more weddings/ larger-scale events we’d expect this will improve.

Overall:
We highly recommend Pyra for a wedding reception. We had 80 guests in total, which worked very well for the canapes/cocktail hour upstairs (4-6pm), sit-down buffet downstairs (6-8pm, split into two seatings) and dancing upstairs (8pm-midnight).  The upstairs loft was able to fit all 80 guests plus a four-piece band.  Lonsdale Road is also a charming street that provided great photo opportunities.  We looked into several other venues, and came away happy with Pyra's quote – we were able to book the venue, food (including canapes, dinner and late night food) and a generous bar tab for roughly the amount some other London venues were charging for just their space (no food or drink included). We and our guests had a fantastic time. Thanks so much to Fionn and the Pyra team :)"
V7,PYRÁ,"We had our wedding celebration at Lula. We booked the loft and restaurant for this.

Positives:
The venue is beautiful and needs minimal decoration.
The food was amazing; the chef is truly professional and everyone loved it.
They redecorated the restaurant section and added a set of couches to make it a lounge, which was beautiful.
The staff was very hardworking, professional, and lovely.

They provided us with a lounge, a wedding breakfast space and a dance floor.

Flexibility with Cake:
The bakery was scheduled to deliver and set up the cake at 16:45, but they delivered it at 09:45 instead. The Lula team handled the situation professionally by storing the cake and setting it up at the correct time. They presented the cake beautifully and assisted in cutting it into nice pieces. It could not have been more perfect.


The list of available drinks was huge, and they were happy to make custom drinks and bring in different juices if requested in advance. The event manager tried to accommodate every wish we had, and on the day we could not have hoped for more. Most of our guests said it was one of the best weddings and most beautiful venues they had ever been to.

Negatives:
Food tasting for the wedding menu was not included, which we had assumed would be, but it was given at a 50% discount. We had to sort out the floral decoration last minute, as they had initially suggested they would arrange it for us after providing a budget, but later said we needed to find our own. At times, they were a bit slow to respond, which made us anxious, but after communicating with them, this was resolved, and communication was very swift.

In conclusion:
Lula gave us the most beautiful wedding we could have dreamt of. We highly recommend them. The venue, the food, the service were amazing, and we could not have hoped for more."
V8,Sandon Manor,"We had such a special wedding at Sandon Manor, the team made every effort to make our day so so special and we will be forever grateful for that. A dream team! The day ran so smoothly and they worked so hard. The venue is unique with lots of different spaces which unfold throughout the day, which was perfect as our wedding fell on a wet and windy autumnal day. We would highly recommend Sandon Manor!"
V8,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor provided the perfect venue for our wedding. From the initial conversations and meetings with the team, we knew we were in safe hands and had made the right choice. They kept us informed with any events, made information a bit payments clear and reassured us with any query we had.
The accommodation was exceptional and fitted our requirements perfectly, with high quality finishing touches throughout to ensure our stay was as comfortable as possible.
The wedding venue was incredible! Our ceremony took place in the gorgeously modern barn with stunning draping and greenery. Following on, we had a blissful drinks reception which was on the expertly manicured lawn (with mini golf!) and sun-trap of a courtyard. We then moved onto our wedding breakfast which was held in the main barn, seating all of our guests comfortably with space for decor and extra details. Following from dinner, the part started and the club room came to life! This was absolutely the talking point of the day and our guests raved about how incredible it was! It managed to create a club-like atmosphere, whilst maintaining the vibe, albeit at a reduced volume, in the rest of the barn. The layout of the venue was important to us, as it ensured our guests never strayed too far, to keep the momentum of the day.
The team at Sandon worked superbly with all of vendors which ensured the day ran smoothly from set up to clearing. All of our vendors commented on how much they too loved working there.
The venue, the aesthetics, the staff, everything was perfect! We would absolutely recommend to anyone getting married."
V8,Sandon Manor,"We cannot recommend Sandon Manor enough. From the quality of the service, the helpfulness and friendliness of the team, the beautiful accommodation and the most amazing venue which all or guests loved partying the night away in. To make it even more special the Manor is in amazing grounds in beautiful countryside and nature reserves.
Sandon Manor made our dream come true."
V8,Sandon Manor,"I couldn't recommend Sandon Manor highly enough - from our first enquiry to our Wedding, nothing was too much trouble. The team are so friendly and easy to communicate with, very approachable and responsive. They respond to any questions immediately and having the day before to set up with Tom was fantastic. Styaying in the Manor House and Dovecote was the icing on the cake as to be with friends and family the night before and the day after was so fabulous. On the day Tom and the team were absolutely fantastic and couldn't have done more to make our special day. We couldn't have dreamt of anywhere more perfect than Sandon Manor - a huge thank you to all the staff."
V8,Sandon Manor,"If you are considering Sandon Manor for your wedding venue, I beg you: scratch it off your list now. Yes, the house and grounds are beautiful, but the people behind it are absolutely awful. They ruined our wedding experience.

I will get straight to it. Sandon Manor has a very strict policy on guests leaving the site by 11:30pm (and no one is allowed back to the Manor unless they’re official guests staying overnight). We had lots of international guests at our wedding. Many hadn’t seen each other in years and would be jetlagged - we thought they may be keen to continue chatting after 11:30pm. With this in mind, we made a booking with Sandon Village Hall via our contacts at the church (where we were attending services and later married). They granted us access to the village hall until 1am as a contingency spill over space.

We mentioned this in passing during our online meeting with one of the Sandon Manor team a month before our wedding. Within hours, I received a voicemail from the lady in charge of Village Hall bookings saying (quote) “someone at Sandon Manor is trying to throw a spanner into the works for you”. It soon transpired that they had raised an official complaint to the parish council and pressurised the village hall team into cancelling our booking. To be clear, Sandon village Hall and Sandon Manor are entirely separate entities – there is no crossover between them whatsoever, as the owner of Sandon Manor later acknowledged.

It gets worse. Gob smacked, we asked Kate – the owner of Sandon Manor – for a call to find out what was going on. She was abhorrent, trying to justify her meddling as a necessary measure to protect her wedding license (side note: with Sandon Manor it is always about the money – once your deposit is paid they care nothing for your ‘special day’; you are just another cash cow). Did she apologise for stabbing us, her clients, in the back? No, she did not. She could not even fathom how hurt we were by being completely bypassed in the communication chain and how deceitful and disrespectful this was. My husband and I were quite literally left speechless. We’ve never experienced this sort of treatment from anyone, let alone our wedding venue - to whom we were paying many thousands of pounds. Dealing with this stress in the final month of wedding prep really took its toll on us and soured things. We no longer looked forward to our day, rather dreaded what Sandon Manor might do next.

Aside from this major incident, there were many other occasions when Sandon Manor were unhelpful and unfeeling in their interactions with us:

- We enquired if it would be possible to arrange a large pizza takeaway order instead of using Sandon Manor’s caterer for our late night food. One of the team explained on a call that this wasn’t contractually possible; we acknowledged this. We then received an email saying ‘If you are unable to follow this or any other of our T&C's we would be happy to cancel your booking.’ This was less than a month before our wedding.
- We had a harpist perform in the church. We were told she wasn’t allowed to play during our drinks reception in the grounds due to potential noise complaints (an acoustic harp at 2pm in the afternoon). No other music was permitted outside the house.
- Sandon Manor is an incredibly expensive (in hindsight, grossly overpriced) venue. But we were also hit with hidden fees when booking their accommodation option - an extra £425 ‘cleaning fee’ was added to our bill.
- At the time of booking, Sandon was running a promotion waivering the £700 fee for hiring their ceremony space. As we were marrying at the church, we asked if it would please be possible to put this towards other elements of our day i.e. using their festoon string of lights in the barn (for which they charge £450). They refused.
- We were unsure about booking the 1-bed Dovecote on the grounds as - at £499 for the weekend - it was a considerable expense. While we were deciding Sandon Manor rented it out on Air BnB (to one of our guests, which made for a very awkward conversation).

To summarise, you only get one wedding day. Kate and her team absolutely ruined ours. There are so many other lovely venues in north Hertfordshire run by decent, humane people. Please prioritise your happiness and choose wisely. I wish we had."
V8,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor is a stunning wedding venue with a great team behind it. The exclusive use of the manor for the weekend was a highlight, allowing us to relax with friends and family in the lead up to and after the big day. The Sandon team were brilliant, guiding us through the planning process and ensuring everything ran smoothly on the day. We couldn't have asked for a better place and team to help us celebrate our big day."
V8,Sandon Manor,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our special day. Holly, Tom and the rest of the brilliant team made us feel welcome from day one. Special mention to Tom for making the day run so seamlessly, so professional and accommodating of all our needs.

The venue itself is stunning, located in the beautiful Hertfordshire countryside. The Manor House makes for a tremendous location to prepare, and the Dovecote suite is a nice touch: a great addition for the groom to spend the last night. We loved the small details of the characteristic main venue, with the botanical feel to the bar a great backdrop to the barn.

It’s a shame we can’t stay every week!

Dan & Suzanne"
V8,Sandon Manor,"To Holly, Louise, Tom & Kate, wow, what can we say but the biggest thank you for the best day of our lives! When we viewed the beautiful venue over two years ago we just knew instantly Sandon Manor was the one, not just because it’s stunning, but you guys are amazing! Thank you for making all our wedding dreams come true. Forever grateful and can’t wait to return to reminisce. Lots of love, the new Mr & Mrs Jakes xxx"
V8,Sandon Manor,"From the moment we visited Sandon Manor we knew this would be our wedding venue for 9 September 2023. Seeing the spectacular finish of the house carry through to the completed venue just shows the high level of attention to detail this venue had to offer.

Holly, Tom and the rest of the team filled us with confidence right from our first interactions, annd went above and beyond on the wedding weekend itself to facilitate us, our suppliers and guests. The main house, dovecote, annex and extensive grounds were a wonderful way to have close family stay with us on site, and so handy to be able to all get ready nearby the morning of.

Thank you for making our wedding weekend a truly memorable occasion, for us and our families. We all look back on this day with the happiest, sunniest memories and Sandon Manor will always have a very special place in our hearts."
V8,Sandon Manor,"We had the most amazing wedding weekend at Sandon Manor.

The venue itself is the perfect backdrop for a wedding, our photos looked amazing from every single angle. There were so many spaces to make use of throughout the day which helped things to run incredibly smoothly and meant we didn’t need to have a ‘turnaround’ during the evening. The spaces really wowed our guests and created such a lovely atmosphere. Including the ‘club room’ dance floor that had our guests dancing until the very last song!

We stayed at the Manor House for the weekend, extending our wedding into a perfect weekend retreat. The house itself is beautiful, with lots of different areas for everyone to relax, and the perfect peaceful location to chill the night before the big day!

From our first viewing to checking out the day after our wedding, the Sandon staff were attentive, friendly and helped us feel relaxed and looked after throughout an otherwise overwhelming process. We’d highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for a beautiful, peaceful and unique wedding venue!"
V9,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Thank you so much to the entire team for making our wedding so special! Thanks to Donique, MJ, Mo, Harry and everyone else for helping us organise our day and for their professional but friendly attitude. Merchant Taylors is such a beautiful venue and offers a brilliant layout and different spaces to make the day so special!"
V9,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you all so very much for such an amazing wedding on Saturday. You all worked tirelessly to make it so special. Everything was truly wonderful and you all did me proud! Both Hugh and I couldn’t have asked for anything more in terms of being so well looked after. Our guests were so impressed and have given us so many compliments on a brilliantly well run event. Thank you all again for playing a brilliant part in our truly wonderful day of which we loved every minute
V9,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you so much for the most wonderful wedding reception at the end of April. We had the perfect day and our guests all commented on how well looked after they has been. Thank you again for all your hard work!
V9,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"We know this is very late (we have no excuse), but we wanted to say thank you for everything you and the team at Merchant Taylor's did for us on our wedding day. All the guests have since told us how much they loved the venue, food and service. Fingers crossed you get a few couples getting in touch! Again, Thank You for everything!"
V9,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"My brother and I attended the wedding today, as Florist's for the wedding party.
We were treated fantastically well by ALL the staff that we met, nothing was too much trouble and they made our task a COMPLETE pleasure.
If this is how they treat the actual wedding party then you will have a unforgettable time. Many thanks to all the staff for helping us to do our job with ease ."
V9,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Zara,

Can we thank you and your team at Merchant Taylor’s Hall for all your hard work in making Caroline and Neil’s recent wedding so very special. You, in particular, were able to deal with every question and request in a really professional manner.

Merchant Taylors’ Hall is part of the rich panoply of history and tradition, which makes this great City. All of our guests, and in particular those from abroad, were totally spell bound by the atmosphere, the food and service.

James was superb in organising the whole operation. To turn the Great Hall from a wedding ceremony hall to a banqueting suite for 110 guests, including flowers, place settings and dance floor in ninety minutes was truly remarkable.

The food and wine was of an amazing standard, we know that Merchant Taylors’ Hall has a reputation for presenting some of the finest dining in the City of London. You certainly surpassed all expectations.

We have many wonderful memories of the 10th September 2016, but it is best summed up by our daughter Caroline, “Can we do it all over again?”."
V10,Garden Museum,I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate everything that you did to make our party such a success last Friday. It was brilliant being outside on such a lovely everning. Everyone was very impressed with the venue.
V10,Garden Museum,"Thank you for all your help, advice and on-the-day support, it really made our wedding very special and it certianly went off without a hitch! The Museum looked amazing and the garden was perfect, especially as the sunshine adn the guests wanted to make the most of the beautiful surroundings."
V11,Clearwell Castle,"Can’t tell you how wonderful the team were at Clearwell. Our wedding coordinator Phaedra was exceptional. Attention to detail and everyone of the team from front of house, waiting staff, groundsmen and the DJ made our day absolutely everything we dreamed of and unique to us.

Can’t recommend highly enough and cost was outstanding value for money.

So many our guest commented on the quality of the food and that it was the best wedding they had been too! The children loved the magic of the castle and opportunity to get outside and see the grounds.

The grooms family had a fabulous time staying in the cottages the night before and our guests at both the Castle & the Wyndham had a fabulous stay on the night of the wedding.

Wish we could do it all again!"
V11,Clearwell Castle,We had our wedding at Clearwell in June and we couldn’t recommend it highly enough. From start to finish everything was perfect and they went above and beyond to ensure we had an amazing day. I’d not hesitate in recommending them to any couples. Just a gorgeous place with staff that really care in making your day all that you hope it will be.
V11,Clearwell Castle,"From the moment we first visited Clearwell, we knew this was the venue for us. From the moment we started planning to the final touches on the day, all the staff were fantastic. Ann, our wedding coordinator, was a delight to work with throughout. Nothing was too much trouble and she kept us updated throughout. The day was tailored exactly to our needs and when we arrived at the venue on the day they had prepared everything perfectly.

We did the night before package which included rooms and food the evening before. We were supplied with so much food no one went hungry. The rooms in the Wyndham and the Castle are fantastically appointed.

The venue itself is gorgeous. The cellar bar downstairs adds a whole different dimension to the occasion where you can really let your hair down.

This was an absolute dream come true venue for us. We loved every single minute."
V11,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot fault this venue at all. We initially had to change our wedding date because of lockdown and they were so supportive and empathetic.
Ann, our coordinator, is quite possibly the loveliest person on the planet. She was always happy to answer any questions and it never felt like we were being a nuisances or asking a silly question.
On the morning of the wedding she was a lovely calm presence and the whole day just ran like clockwork.
The food was out of this world with many guests saying it was the best food they’d had at a wedding and one person actually thought we’d hired a Michellin Chef!
The venue is so so beautiful with plenty of space. The downstairs cellar was a great place to party the night away, it was like an exclusive nightclub. There were lots of quieter rooms for people who wanted some peace.
The DJ was brilliant, we forgot to give a list of songs we liked but he did a great job of guessing what we liked ( he must’ve looked at our age and figured nineties dance music was our era. And he was bang on the money)
I do not have a single complaint about this venue"
V11,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot speak highly enough about Clearwell Castle as a wedding venue. The venue itself is absolutely stunning. It rained on our wedding day but the indoor space was so vast and beautiful that ourselves and our guests still had the most amazing time! Our wedding co-ordinator, Phaedra, was absolutely incredible, both before and during the wedding. She was always so professional, replied to all of my emails (there were many) and answered all queries efficiently. On the day, we genuinely could not have managed without her. The day flowed so well with her guidance and it really helped me as the Bride as I felt I didn't need to worry about anything! All the other staff at Clearwell and at the Wyndham hotel were also so wonderful! Everyone worked so hard and every member of staff was so kind to us; it just made our day incredibly special and we are so appreciative to them all. The food was great, service very quick and all the guests really enjoyed it! We had so many compliments about the staff and venue! I honestly could not recommend Clearwell castle more as a wedding venue!"
V11,Clearwell Castle,"Our wedding on 10/11/23 was just the absolute perfect day from start to finish. Our wedding planner manager, Hannah, was incredible, not just on the day but throughout the whole planning process. She ensured everything ran smoothly on the day, sparing no details ensuring everything was just perfect and to time but without being stressful. She was very accommodating with the planning meetings working around both mine and my now Husband's shift patterns.
We both stayed the night before our wedding and the night of the wedding with many of our guests travelling a distance so also staying in the Wyndham which was very convenient. Staying in Keepers cottage with the Bridesmaids the night before added to the experience with the added feature of the hot tub, the groomsmen were very jealous. The beds were very comfortable and everyone was excited to stay in a castle.
On the day of the wedding, the staff were very accommodating moving the bridal party along to the bridal suite to finish preparations earlier than originally planned. The breakfast provided was the perfect amount for a busy morning getting ready. Everything, including the gardens, were immaculately kept adding to the WOW factor of getting married in a Castle.
The canapes served and welcome drinks were well received by the guests and ourselves whilst we had photographers prior to the wedding breakfast. The food was phenomenal and great portions and I was stuffed after. The staff were very accommodating for us with a lot of people with allergies, dislikes of mushrooms so adapting the menu for these individual people. We were even able to swap out a few bottles of wine included in our package for cocktails as us as the Bride and Groom did not drink wine.
As soon as we walked in the venue the first time, we knew it was the place we wanted to get married. Everytime we went back to view the venue again I fell more and more in love. For anyone thinking about viewing or even booking this incredible venue I would say do it! We will be going back for events in the future to relive the best day of our lives."
V11,Clearwell Castle,"We got married at Clearwell castle April 2023. What can I say it's the most perfect venue and we had the most amazing day. The organisation was amazing and the staff were great on the day and even leading up to the big day. Phaedra was our wedding planner and communication with her was great throughout and on our wedding day she ensured that it all ran smoothly. I cannot recommend Clearwell castle and their staff enough. Thank you again for helping us have our dream wedding.
Kind regards

Vanessa & David x"
V11,Clearwell Castle,"We had the most amazing wedding day on the 24th of November 2023, the whole day ran so smoothly and all our guests absolutely loved the venue. The food was amazing and our guests loved the fish and chip buffet in the evening! The whole progress of planning the wedding was so straight forward and Phedera was a great wedding manager."
V11,Clearwell Castle,"Clearwell Castle exceeded all our expectations for our wedding day. The moment we stepped onto the grounds, we were captivated by its timeless charm. The staff, especially Hannah, went above and beyond to make every detail perfect, ensuring a seamless and stress-free experience. The Ball Room, where we exchanged our vows, felt like something out of a storybook. The surrounding gardens provided a stunning backdrop for photos and added to the overall enchantment of the day. Our guests were equally impressed, and many commented on the unique and romantic atmosphere. Choosing Clearwell Castle was the best decision we made for our special day; it truly felt like a fairy-tale come to life."
V11,Clearwell Castle,"We had the perfect wedding at Clearwell Castle, their team were superb in providing planning assistance from the point of our booking, guidance on all aspects of our wedding choices from registrars and suppliers, and coordination on the day of the wedding to make sure it flowed seamlessly. It was a beautiful day, and we couldn't be happier with our choice of Wedding location."
V12,Inner Temple,We got married here in 2023. Everything was perfect and the team made sure the day/food etc was just as we wanted it. Particular thanks to Priya and Eva (Pegasus) for their hard work making our wedding day and lead up so special.
V13,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"I got married at Dodford Manor in February this year. A great time was had by all and I will be recommending the venue to any friends planning weddings.

The weather was bad on the day so we didn’t get to use the outside area very much, but it didn’t matter as the inside is so lovely.

Sky was really helpful and put me at ease on the day. Questions in the lead up and on the day were answered quickly and I was made to feel like the only bride in the world!"
V13,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford was the first venue we looked at shortly after we got engaged. The staff were friendly and relaxed when we had a tour, I knew it was the place for us! I think Lydia telling my now husband that we couldn’t have fireworks due to the animals nearby but we could have a fire performer outside, sold the deal for us! I got an amazing fire performer as a surprise for my husband and the guests after we had sparklers, and it just completed an amazing day!
We heard such positive things Dodford about how professional and smooth running weddings have been from our suppliers, and you guys didn’t disappoint. You handled the day so well, we didn’t worry about a thing and just enjoyed ourselves the whole day.
We honestly had so many lovely messages and conversations after our wedding about how the venue was amazing, everything and everyone was catered for, from my 88 year old Nan, to young children who could play and enjoy the outdoors with a scoop of amazing ice cream. We honestly couldn’t have asked for a better day, we would do it again in a heartbeat if we could! Thank you for making the day so seamless! We are eternally grateful to everyone at Dodford for making our dreams come true becoming Mr and Mrs Price!"
V13,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford Manor what an incredible venue, from initial enquiry to booking, Dodford and the staff were so accommodating and well organised. Nothing was ever too much trouble, even if emails were being sent at 11pm. The day itself, wow it was absolutely incredible, as our wedding was on a budget and due to small numbers Dodford were amazing at setting out our decorations, everything was absolutely perfect and a special shout out to Kayleigh who was amazing on our wedding day. She kept us on time, always checking we were okay and just such a lovely person and really made our day perfect. Would highly recommend a Dodford to any couple due to be married they make the planning and the day an absolute dream and we want to relive it over again."
V13,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"It goes without saying that Dodford is a fab venue.... stunning set up, well maintained, clean, perfect grounds etc... but the best thing about Dodford is the team! I had super high expectations of any wedding venue I booked as I used to run a wedding venue myself (potential nightmare client 😂).... from the 1st viewing the team were fantastic. Relaxed, stress free, organised, professional, knowledgeable, flexible but mostly importantly friendly which gave me complete confidence in them delivering my perfect day.
In the run up to the big day the team are super responsive on email and phone We didn't meet our Event Manager, Lydia, until the day but I was always confident that they work as a whole team and therefore having 1 point of contact was not necessary at all.
In the day Lydia was amazing! Still relaxed and professional and the whole day ran so smoothly. Every requirement was perfect, on time, delivered exceptionally.
We had the best day, thank you to the whole team (especially Lydia!)

V13,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We honestly can’t say thank you enough for how amazing Dodford Manor Barn was, along with all the incredible staff who helped make our day truly unforgettable.

From the moment we visited, we fell in love with the beautiful landscapes, open-plan barns, and stunning large windows that flooded the space with natural light. The venue package was one of the best we saw during our search—it felt like everything we could possibly need was covered.

The team at Dodford Manor Barn were incredibly friendly and supportive throughout the entire planning process. Communication was open and consistent, which made everything feel so much more manageable and stress-free. We were even able to find all of our wonderful vendors through Dodford Manor Barn, which was a huge bonus!

As a bride who suffers from anxiety, I was unwell on the morning of the wedding. But I have to give special thanks to Kayleigh and our vendors, who were absolutely amazing and supported me through every step—they helped me feel calm, cared for, and ready to enjoy the day.

Our guests couldn’t stop talking about how stunning the venue was and how lovely the food turned out. We were also lucky enough to have sunshine all day, topped off with a beautiful sunset in the evening—it truly felt magical.

Thank you again, Dodford Manor Barn, for being such a perfect place to start our next chapter.

With love,
Carter & Emmie (24.03.2025) x"
V13,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"From the moment we booked our wedding at Dodford Manor, we knew we were in good hands—but nothing could have prepared us for just how extraordinary the experience would be. Every single detail was handled with such precision, care, and genuine warmth that it truly felt like a dream come to life.

The venue itself is breathtaking, but what made our day unforgettable was the impeccable service. The entire team operated like a well-oiled machine, making sure everything ran smoothly while keeping the atmosphere joyful and stress-free. Their attention to detail was second to none—no request was too big or too small.

We want to give a heartfelt, special shoutout to *Lydia*, our incredible Wedding Manager. From our first meeting to the final dance, she was nothing short of amazing. Lydia went above and beyond at every turn—anticipating needs before we even voiced them, coordinating flawlessly with suppliers, and offering support with a calming confidence that put us completely at ease, (apart from making me cry the second I saw her! 😂). Her passion for what she does shone through in every interaction, and our day would not have been the same without her.

Thanks to this amazing venue and its phenomenal team (especially Lydia!), we were able to truly enjoy every moment of our wedding, knowing everything was in the best possible hands. If you're considering this venue for your big day—don’t hesitate. It’s everything you hope for, and more.

We want to do it over and over!
A day we will NEVER forget!!

Thank you again and all our Love,
Mr & Mr Pargeter-Prince
Rowan & Karl xx"
V13,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We booked Dodford Manor in Feb 2024 after we viewed the space, for our wedding in March 2025. It was the only venue we viewed, but instantly fell in love with the character and variety of spaces the venue had to offer. The free corkage also really appealed to us as a great way for us to bring our own drinks at a good cost.

From start to end, the team were amazing, helping us with the planning of the day and making sure we had a great array of suppliers we could work with. The live band was a huge part of our day, and Dodford have a great mixture of acts on their supplier list.

On the day of the wedding, the groomsmen arrived at the venue to help with set up to see that our amazing event manager, Kayleigh had every single aspect of the day in hand and sorted. She sorted all table settings, decor, stationary - Everything!! Nothing was too much to ask of her and the Dodford team. The day ran impeccably well, with everything being on time and everything we asked for being sorted. Our drinks were served chilled, on time and were always around. It’s easy for venues who offer free corkage to try and limit you drinking your own drink - Not here!! There was constantly beers being topped up, wine bottles replaced and aperol spritz being taken round. Cannot fault them!

The team packed all of our bits away and ready for us to collect the next morning. We are very aware Dodford is a busy venue and wanted to make sure we wasn’t just “another wedding” but at no point was that the case. We felt like we were the one and only wedding and genuinely could not ask for more!

Thank you so so much for everything, Highly recommended!!"
V13,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We got married her a month ago today and had the most amazing day with them. Jess, Jack and the team made sure that everything ran smoothly and that they were doing everything they could for us on the day. We would 100% recommend them for anyone wishing to marry in such a beautiful setting."
V13,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We had been apprehensive booking Dodford for our reception that it was so popular in Northamptonshire that our wedding could end up looking the same as a lot of others we knew of, as we're local - but that was a ridiculous thing to worry about! The level of flexibility/customisation you get with Dodford is unmatched in our opinion; as it's such a beautiful venue to start with, you don't have to work hard to make it look good before adding in your personality as a couple!

The whole process from enquiries to final planning and the execution on the day were great. We did have a slight issue with them not inviting us to a food tasting in enough time before our wedding date (whether they forgot/we were missed off a list we don't know) but when we did raise it they invited us to a tasting at their sister venue instead (it's 2 hours away but we were available to travel thankfully). Every member of staff we encountered in our experience with Dodford were so friendly and make you feel like you are the only couple that matters for them in that moment, which we really appreciated from such a popular/busy venue. Abbie was our Event Manager on the day and provided such an elevated level of service, nothing was too much trouble and she executed our plans/vision to a tee, adding in some extra details that we loved too.

Our wedding was in December 2024, and we only had our reception at Dodford, so the ceremony barn was set up for our drinks reception with plenty of space for guests without it feeling cramped or equally like we were all rattling around in there (we had 75 guests for our reception). They don't have many photos of indoor drinks receptions in their promo so I was a little worried how it would look but the team had it set up beautifully. We also had a brass band on the mezzanine level which was really fun and festive!

What sold Dodford for us was the no daytime corkage, which meant we could really personalise our drinks reception and wedding breakfast drinks without breaking the bank. There was a slight disconnect with how and when we had requested/planned to serve some of the drinks in our planning meeting and what happened on the day, which we think may have been a slight hiccup in communication between Dodford and Jenkinsons (the caterers), but it didn't have a negative impact on our day at all!

Overall, there's a reason this is such a popular venue - it is truly perfect!"
V13,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,Dodford manor is an amazing wedding venue. From the very beginning when we first stepped into the venue to look around we fell in love. We knew we had to have our wedding there. After booking the venue we had amazing contact with the staff from booking our food tasting session. To a general email to see how our wedding planning was going. The planning meeting was well organised and we were able to talk through exactly what we wanted and no want was too big for the team.
V14,Gosfield Hall,"I never imagined my wedding would be somewhere as stunning as Gosfield hall but from the minute we saw this venue we knew it was the one for us and didn't bother viewing anymore venues as we had already made our minds up about having our wedding here! We were absolutely blown away with the natural beauty of Gosfield hall and so booked two years in advance of our wedding day! The professionalism and advice we received from Linda was super helpful and informative on the run up to our wedding as there is soo much to think about! We loved that we could have our day and evening all in one place aswell as the option weather permitting to have our wedding ceremony outside. I'm pleased to say the weather was absolutely perfect on our wedding day and we got to have our fairytale wedding outside! The package we paid for was well worth the money! Our guests were absolutely spoilt on our day and have all said it was the best wedding they've ever been too! It was amazing to have our guests stay over aswell! Jocie our wedding planner was absolutely amazing! She was sooo friendly and super accommodating and went above and beyond on our day to make it absolutely perfect with no hiccups! She even helped dress me on the day as she knew how to do up a corset dress and my mother didn't have a clue lol she made all my wedding details and decorations come to life and done such a stunning job decorating our dream venue aswell as being super supportive towards me my family and guests! The honeymoon suite is the best we've ever seen and completely took ours and our guests breaths away! Mind blowing! The food,venue,grounds,accomodation and night before accomodation were absolutely stunning and we want to thank everyone at Gosfield hall for making our day soo incredible and special and a day we and our guests will never forget! We can't wait to return to Gosfield! Thank you everyone at Gosfield what an amazing place!"
V14,Gosfield Hall,"We had previously experienced Gosfield Hall as a guest before deciding on it for our anniversary.

Our day was beautiful and went according to plan. Our guests all had great feedback about the day.

The only thing we would have changed would have been more diverse menu for the main meals."
V14,Gosfield Hall,"Gosfield hall is a beautiful location for a wedding and their packages cover all the important stuff! We didn’t have to worry about caterers, wedding coordinator or a DJ - all included! Great service, lovely food and everyone really enjoyed the day! Our coordinator Jocie was fab on the day, getting everything organised and fetching anything we needed. Couldn’t have asked for better, she knew the time line and the day flowed really smoothly!"
V14,Gosfield Hall,"We got married at Gosfield Hall and everything about it was perfect from when we arrive to view it, booking, the communication and Faye Carter our wedding Coordinator! If you want the best wedding day with no hassle, Gosfield is your place!!"
V14,Gosfield Hall,"Myself and my Wife have just got married at Gosfield Hall,
Our expensive started when we viewed the venue and we first met Linda sales manager, she welcome us in & made us feel at home, we wasn’t sure how, but she made us feel calm like this was where we was meant to be.
Once we looked around at all the venue has to offer we had already made a decision as this is such a stunning location and instantly new this was what we wanted! It was just right for us.

We did not get made to feel pressured to make any decisions immediately however we did end up booking our big say within the next few days after our visit.

Our next contact was with Ellie our wedding planner, she was very helpful and nothing was ever to much, we enjoyed the food tasting at the venue and was very impressed with the experience, it was out of this world.
Ellie helped us through all of our problems and made sure all of our plans come to life.

Now on our big day, what can I say? The staff were amazing, Ellie couldn’t have done enough every time you wanted to ask a question she was next to us any time we needed something. She was there all the way through the day/ night & even the next morning, Ellie made our day Run seamlessly.
We’ve been to many weddings before but never have we had food as amazing as we did here.
Every guest was amazed at the food quality and commented on how delicious it was!
Just to sum up if you’re thinking about booking your wedding at Gosfield Hall don’t question it just book it. You will be amazed."
V14,Gosfield Hall,"The venue is stunning and was the perfect setting for our winter wedding (so much natural light even in January). Jocie Golbourn was our assigned wedding planning specialist and she is so kind, sweet, patient and professional. All our guests loved the venue but many actually commented on how flawless and seamless the day was organised and rooms decorated and prepared from each section of the wedding and we only have Jocie and venue staff to thank for their meticulous planning and preparations. The food and drinks were delicious. Couldn’t recommend this venue enough- we actually booked the venue on a whim and were SO happy when we visited for an open day. There’s no false advertisements- it’s stunning."
V14,Gosfield Hall,"Everything, from start to finish, was exactly what we wanted and more. The preparation was helped by our wonderful personal manager, Tara, and accommodated each and every one of our requests and needs. The venue is gorgeous, food delicious, and atmosphere felt special. Our friends and family all told us that this was such a spectacular wedding for them that it was the best they've ever been to. We felt completely taken care of, kept us calm and happy throughout the day, and kept all of our suppliers in place and to standard. It felt glamourous and unique. We wish we could relive the day over and over. It really was our dream wedding."
V14,Gosfield Hall,"We got married in Gosfield Hall in May and had the most amazing wedding day that any couple could ask for. The whole experience from the arrival the night before to leaving the day after was seamlessly managed by the team at the venue.
The house and the grounds looked absolutely stunning and Ellie and the team did a brilliant job at keeping the day running smoothly without making anyone feel rushed. Everyone there was immensely friendly and helpful and we really felt that everyone who worked there was invested in making our day feel special.
We fell in love with the venue when we booked it but the whole experience exceeded out expectations so much that we wish we could do it all again!"
V14,Gosfield Hall,"I wanted to take a moment to commend and state our appreciation for Jocie. She truly was phenomenal, approachable and no task was too big.
We had 5 months to plan our wedding and we loved every moment. With us both working in the service industry it was great to have someone who was so switched on and would be an asset to have on any team."
V14,Gosfield Hall,"Having just got married at Gosfield Hall I can honestly say it was the most beautiful venue and the most perfect day. The staff were so attentive and professional. The food was outstanding and the drinks and cocktails were fabulous. They couldn’t do enough to make sure our day was everything we’d dreamt of. I have to say a special thanks to Ellie - one of the wedding coordinators on site - she went above and beyond to help us plan our day and was there from the very moment I woke up delivering fresh pastries for breakfast to the moment she made me a cup of tea to go to bed with. I can’t thank you enough Ellie, you are an absolute credit to Gosfield Hall."
V15,Kingston Estate Totnes,"When I first enquired with Kingston I thought it would be too expensive but we explained what are budget was and when we wanted to get married and they put a quote together that was affordable.
We have just had the most amazing one day wedding which didn't finish until the early hours. We got married in the Long Barn where there are chandeliers running down the middle, it was very romantic. There is this nightclub at Kingston which is very cool which everyone loved. The guests all said the venue was stunning and the food was out of this world.
A few of us stayed the night before and most of our guests stayed the night of the wedding in the cottages and barns. The staff were brilliant and they coordinated the whole day for us. I cant recommend the venue enough."
V15,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had a two day wedding at the Kingston Estate. All our guests were completely blown away by it.
Most of our friends and family had traveled far for the weekend and were not disappointed when then arrived as the cottages and barns are gorgeous. Some even have hot tubs.
Jodie and the Weddings Team organised a welcome party for the first night which was unreal along with providing street style food for everyone around 8.30 pm. At Kingston they have this really cool enormous Yurt and food hut which is used the day before the wedding and for breakfast.
On the wedding day itself we got married in the Walled Garden and there were endless canapes during the drinks reception. We then decided to eat in the Hayloft Barn which has glass windows overlooking all the gardens.
We used the clear span marquee for our reception party and had the craziest cover band before we all went into the nightclub until 3 am. The good thing about Kingston is everything is included they let you use things like cake stands, easels, knifes, speakers, microphones, all furniture at no extra cost, they set everything up for you and then clean up afterwards. We didn]t have to do anything which made everything totally stress free.

Thank you Jodie, Ellie and Charlotte it was insane !!"
V15,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had the most magical wedding at Kingston. From the moment we set foot onto the grounds, we knew it was the perfect place for our special day. It was our first viewing… and nothing else compared for us (we saw a total of 6 venues). What stood out to us the most was the variety of spaces available for each part of the day. The selection of ceremony areas, the beautiful outdoor spots for photos, the yurt for the night before party, and a special one for us… the underground nightclub for the evening! As party lovers, this was a part that sold it for us; there was somewhere for every moment.

One of the things we loved most was the flexibility to personalize every aspect of our wedding. The venue truly felt like a blank canvas that we could transform into our dream setting, but equally, we got away with doing absolutely nothing as it was beautiful all on its own.

But what truly made our experience unforgettable was the incredible staff, led by Jodie. They were not only professional and attentive but also genuinely warm and welcoming. Their support and attention to detail ensured that everything ran smoothly, allowing us to relax and fully enjoy our day.

We're hoping to return and stay in the future, for a special occasion.

It's not just a wedding venue; it's a place that holds a special spot in our hearts as the backdrop to the beginning of our happily ever after 🤍"
V15,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Kingston was perfect. Despite a rainy start, the day was amazing and Jodie was available but subtly in the background allowing the day to be ours."
V15,Kingston Estate Totnes,"After over a two and a half year wait due to Covid, our son and his wife had a wonderful wedding weekend. Jodie from Kingston Estate and her team of staff went above and beyond to ensure the wedding ran smoothly. Every detail was dealt with professionally. The accommodation, venue and food were all excellent and all our guests many from overseas had a wonderful time. The only thing Jodie could not oversee was the weather but even a little rain didn't spoil the celebrations."
V15,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue and staff were brilliant from start to finish. The venue is really multi-functional and caters for rain or shine. The weather was really unpredictable around the time of our wedding but I was a stress free bride knowing they had it in hand. The food supplier was stunning - we had a weekend package which all the guests raved about. That coupled with the unlimited drinks pages made it the perfect venue for us. A Devon treasure that feels like being on a film set - everyone loved it!
V15,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Such a beautiful venue - we loved it so much. The food was incredible and despite having a changeover of wedding planner close to the wedding day, it had no impact on our day what so ever. The venue are calm and professional and loved their approach to communication which was friendly."
V15,Kingston Estate Totnes,Fell in love with the venue on our first visit. We were particularly looking for a venue which could cater us for 3 days and sleep the majority of the the guests. The grounds were well kept especially the walled garden which is where the ceremony took place. The team were a pleasure and made the day truly special.
V15,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Our 3-day wedding celebrations were spent at the STUNNING Kingston Estate - a truly unique venue that we absolutely fell in love with. It had EVERYTHING we were looking for & more. The grounds are perfectly manicured all year round & come complete with walled garden. The cottages & main house are beautifully decorated, providing luxurious accommodation for 86 of our guests. Sarah & the team were such a pleasure to work with & couldn’t do enough for us. The catering was also top notch. Thank you"
V15,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue was great we had a few personal health issues beforehand but the team went above and beyond to make the day extra special. The wedding planner organised everything for us and they had plenty of props on site that we were free to use. We had the whole place to ourselves for the weekend it was brilliant and our friends loved the hot tub and pool.
V16,Holmewood Hall,"We were married at Holmewood Hall on 15th February 2025 and I can honestly say that it was the most magical day. We went to visit the venue and instantly fell in love with it but even we were blown away by how beautiful everything looked on the day. All of the staff were amazing - special shoutout to our personal wedding manager, Laura Pike, who was always on hand to answer any questions - she couldn’t do enough for us! The food was wonderful & we had full control over the menu. Would highly recommend this venue, you won’t regret it!"
V16,Holmewood Hall,"Holmewood Hall was an absolutely perfect wedding venue. The house is stunning, well cared for and beautifully decorated. All of the staff are so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Our Wedding Coordinator was fantastic, available from early morning of the wedding and was still there the morning after working for us. The food was excellent, drinks and canapes were amazing and the venue took care of everything for us. We had the most perfect wedding and are so pleased we chose Holmewood Hall. The Gold Room where we had our ceremony is gorgeous. Thank you for giving us a beautiful wedding!"
V16,Holmewood Hall,"I cannot fault this venue at all, the venue itself is breathtakingly beautiful with magnificent rooms and very lovingly maintained grounds. The staff are incredibly friendly, professional and efficient, our wedding coordinator Lee was a pleasure to work with and made our special day run smoothly. If you want a hassle free wedding with breathtaking grounds and the most amazing staff then this is the venue for you."
V16,Holmewood Hall,"Had the most amazing wedding here recently and cannot recommend it enough.

The venue itself is stunning and the options included in the luxe package covered everything we could've possibly wanted and made planning the wedding 100x less stressful.

The staff were all amazing from start to finish, Katie showed us around initially and then Lee was our personal wedding manager, and they were both incredible throughout. Always on hand to answer any questions and help us through the day once we got there.
We had so many comments from our guests on how lovely the staff were on the day!

A particular highlight though was the food - the tasting evening was a dream and the chef went above and beyond to provide a full vegan menu for us which wasn't limited to only a couple of options.
Again, we had so many non-vegan guests complimenting the food and saying how lovely it was!

Overall, an incredible day and an incredible venue.
Thank you so much to everyone there!"
V16,Holmewood Hall,"This place is simply just amazing 🤩
We had our wedding here on 17-12-24 and it was everything we dreamed of and more. The food, staff, decor were just perfect not forgetting the most beautiful Christmas tree 😍
Our person wedding planner Lee was an absolute god send not just having him there on the day but always being at the end of a phone to answer any questions or worry’s.
If we could go back and do it all again we would and not change a single thing.
The most perfect day at the most perfect venue ♥️"
V16,Holmewood Hall,Perfect venue for a wedding with guest numbers 60 - 100. Our guests and I moved from each room to a new room throughout the day and every room had a new surprise. The bridal suite was lush and it was great having all our guests staying under one roof. I would 100% recommend this to anyone.
V16,Holmewood Hall,"The wedding day and lead up to the day were fab. However, for the price we paid, we expected a little bit more.
I opted to use the bridal cottage the evening before for which we paid £450 extra. This is something I now regret, as there was no hot water and we were not able to order any food in as all the take away options were shut (on a Friday night). The hot tub also needed a good clean. So the night before/morning of my wedding was not ideal. I flagged this to the manager who advised that we should have raised the cold water issue as soon as possible, but seeing as we were trying to have morning showers on the wedding day, this did not leave us any time.
Our package included pre-drinks, wine with dinner and we also purchased a cocktail ""cart"" (cocktails on a table) and a bucket of beers. The groom, who is not a wine fan, asked for a beer with his wedding meal and was presented with a contactless card machine to pay for it at the top table. We felt this was a bit unnecessary as there was a full bucket of extra beers outside and it felt a little embarrassing having a card machine presented to us at the top table on our wedding day for one measly Corona, despite the huge amount we had paid. Also, guests were unknowingly allowed to buy beers from the bar after the meal, despite there being available beers to them already in a bucket next to the bar...
Overall the wedding was lovely, but for the price we paid we expected a bit better. Essentially, I loved the venue, but I wish we had not purchased any extras!"
V16,Holmewood Hall,"We got married at Holmewood Hall on 4th October 2024. From the first moment we stepped into the venue and I saw the magnificent Gold room I knew this would be the perfect place for us to get married. We had the most amazing day which was perfectly coordinated by the whole team at Holmewood but especially so by our personal wedding manager Lee. Lee was always quick to respond to any questions we had in the lead up to the day and nothing was too much trouble for him.
We honestly wish we could do it all over again as it was a magical day. We would recommend Holmewood Hall to anyone looking for the perfect venue."
V16,Holmewood Hall,"After getting engaged in late March this year we wanted to get married fairly quickly so booked Holmewood for the same September. The venue, grounds, accomodation were all stunning and we felt very fortunate it was within budget and the package we got was outstanding in comparison to other venues and what it included, which was far far more than other venues. We got to attend a luxe event to choose all our wedding food, canapés, cocktails and wines which should have made things easier but due to the unbelievable quality it made it harder! Our wedding planner Lee is literally the most fantastic person. He was flexible, fun, engaged and on absolutely everything. The day was ran impeccably and also smooth even with some weather concerns and speeches taking a bit longe than we thought. If you book here ask for Lee!! We had the most perfect day. Can’t fault a single things. Our guests all told us how incredible everything was with one even saying he will now longer not attend any further weddings unless it’s at Holmewood. Thank you to all the staff and as mentioned a huge special thank you to Lee! Your a legend!"
V16,Holmewood Hall,"Exceptional venue, stunning grounds, fantastic DJ, and excellent service. Highly recommended! Happiest day of my life 😊"
V17,Bourton Hall,"We got married at Bourton Hall on 08 March 2025 and our wedding planner was Harminder. The day was absolutely amazing from start to finish. All the food and drinks were of a high standard and presented beautifully which includes the wedding breakfast, canapés and cocktails, and breakfast the next day. The venue is gorgeous with lots of rooms, well maintained grounds and exclusive use. The staff are friendly and accommodating and the event was really well managed. We would like to particularly thank Harminder, who was supportive throughout the wedding planning process and the wedding day, ensuring things ran smoothly and in a timely manner. He is a great communicator, provided advice and guidance where needed and attention to detail. We really had a magical day! Thank you so much! We would happily do it all over again and would definitely recommend this venue!"
V17,Bourton Hall,"What a fabulous wedding venue! Because it's a wedding venue and not a hotel that holds the occasional wedding, they really focused on what was important and anticipated our every need. It's an elegant venue but with a comfortable feel to it. The team are incredibly accommodating and helpful and each couple is allocated their own personal wedding manager to guide them through the process and to make sure every detail is covered.
There's a beautiful chapel on site where non-religious ceremonies can be held - this was fabulous.
The food was plentiful and delicious - all our guests raved about it. Great choice of welcome drinks and canapes, wines and cocktails.
The grounds are gorgeous; a perfect backdrop for our October wedding.
The venue was exclusively ours and has beautiful bedrooms, including a huge, stunning bridal suite. Most of our guests stayed overnight and took advantage of the brilliant breakfast in the morning so it really extended the celebration."
V17,Bourton Hall,"Our wedding at Bourton Hall was better than we ever imagined. The Italianate mansion is truly spectacular inside and out however it is the team that made our day run perfectly. Our guests found the setting and the food incredible, they were very impressed! Our wedding planner Emily Sarjant was fantastic her knowledge and expertise made our day magical from start to finish, with all the special touches that she suggested. Our first dance was created in such a beautiful way it will be a memory we cherish forever. Thank you to Emily and the team at Bourton Hall. My husband would also like to note that the croquembouche was amazing and everyone should have one."
V17,Bourton Hall,"My wife and I got married at Bourton Hall in September, with our wedding managed by the wonderful Eleni. Everything about the day went as perfectly as we could've wished, right from arrival to departure the following day. The venue is stunning, and the food was lovely, and having 21 bedrooms on site was such a bonus so that all of our close friends and family could stay on site with us.
Bourton Hall did everything they could both in the run up to the day and on the day itself to alleviate all stress to ensure everything ran as seamlessly as possible, which it absolutely did.
We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall enough."
V17,Bourton Hall,"We were married on 28th July 2024. What an amazing day we had at Bourton Hall. Could not fault it! The venue is so elegant! The grounds and views were to die for. The food was out of this world with so many choices and all cooked and served to perfection. Accommodation / rooms were plentiful and luxurious. Lovely to have a chapel on site too. We had the whole place to ourselves, we felt like royalty! Lots of varied rooms and areas for people to choose where they wanted to be after the wedding breakfast. We would choose the venue all over again!"
V17,Bourton Hall,"We had both our wedding ceremony and reception at Bourton Hall and the service was superb throughout. The house and grounds are beautiful with amazing views to go with them. The staff were professional and helpful during the lead up to our wedding day and during the day as well - even when we had an emergency prior to the ceremony which caused delays, the venue staff were able to work around this to move timings back in order to allow all of our planned activities to go ahead and be fully enjoyed. All the food was delicious and we had a wonderful wedding day thanks to Bourton Hall."
V17,Bourton Hall,"We had the most perfect wedding day at Bourton Hall. Throughout the planning process and on the day, the team were so professional, which meant we could relax and know that everything was in their capable hands - Emily was an amazing wedding manager. The building is beautiful inside and out, and the grounds are stunning - there are so many places for beautiful photos, and views out over the countryside. The food was absolutely delicious, it was so hard to choose what to have! It was also so helpful to have so many places for guests to sit and chat in the evening, away from the disco room but still part of the action. Having so many bedrooms onsite (not to mention a stunning bridal suite!) was an added bonus. We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall highly enough, and have had so many comments from guests saying what a beautiful, elegant but relaxed day it was, so I know they really appreciated everything Bourton has to offer too. Thank you so much to Emily and the whole team for giving us such a perfect day!"
V17,Bourton Hall,"As the Bride and Groom we were made to feel like nothing was too much to ask and they couldn't do enough to make us feel special.
All the guests commented that it was one of the prettiest and most relaxed weddings they have been to.
We could not have asked for a better wedding day thanks to Bourton!"
V17,Bourton Hall,"I had my wedding on 10/02/2024 I am so happy I chose this venue, It is really magical. My wedding manager was just the best! Emily went above and beyond to help me on my big day! I cannot thank her enough.

One of the main things about this venue is that t has its own chappel which is really special and makes you wedding seem more traditional, however there are more options/ rooms available. I wanted the wow factor and I got it.

Some of the options that made it great

*Onsite accommodation for night before and night of the wedding is really helpful
*Exclusive use
*Dedicated wedding manager definate gamechanger! (Emily)
*Menu choices are fantastic.

Everyone commented on the food being really nice ( we had the lamb) The evening buffet was also great. I paid extra to have a meal created as having part of my culture within the food at the wedding was very important to me, they did not disappoint.
Emily was perfect in so many ways, she knew exactly my vision once i explained it to her and she made sure that it became real for me. She adapted parts of the day so that it would work better, for example bringing the canapes outside whilst photos where being taken. Helping me into my dress, looking after my phone just everything I needed she was there. She really worked hard to make sure it run perfectly and it did.

Thank you emily!!! You made my day Great."
V17,Bourton Hall,We got married at Bourton Hall on 30th July 2023. It was the most amazing day ever! We are still receiving compliments from our guests on how stunning the venue was and the whole running of the day. This was 100% down to our wedding co-ordinator Harminder. He went above and beyond to ensure our day was absolutely perfect. He literally could not have done any more! Thank you again Harminder!!
V18,B&H Buildings,Bourne & Hollingsworth was such an exceptional venue for our wedding this September. This is the perfect place for you if you want a true London wedding that feels like a fun dinner/house party but on an epic scale. We used the top floor (the studios) for our sit down dinner (think candle light and tasty roast lamb) and headed downstairs for our reception with the basement club (below and hidden) for late night dancing. The place is stunning (greenery and glass everywhere and the cocktails are insane but what really makes this place are the people. The whole staff from Matt and Lizzie to the bar team to the dinner crew made our whole day seamless and so fun. Could not recommend B&H more highly for your London wedding.
V18,B&H Buildings,"Beautiful wedding celebration in the most stylish venue - we had an intimate wedding reception (drinks, dinner and more drinks!) at the Bourne & Hollingsworth Buildings. The staff members on duty were excellent - nothing was too much trouble and they served everyone with such professionalism. We couldn’t recommend it highly enough and we haven’t stopped talking about it since. All of our guests were so impressed with the space and how stylish it was. The bar, restaurant and greenhouse are all aesthetically beautiful and the botanical vibes make for a very relaxed, but premium setting. Special shout out to Lizzie who helped us coordinate everything and Matt on the day who led the team. Thank you so much - we had the best day and we couldn’t have wished to host it in a better venue."
V18,B&H Buildings,"India & the B&H team were seamless. Flexible, responsive, kind, and easy to deal with. They made our day so special. The food was fantastic, the drinks were lovely, and the value for money was first rate!"
V19,Leez Priory,"I never in my life thought I would get married in a place like Leez priory! The whole experience from start to finish was just fantastic. The price breakdown was manageable and there was no pressure to take any upgrades offered. The things we got in our package were phenomenal and having a wedding planner was tremendous - our lady (Leanne) was an absolute god send!
They catered to all our needs and we were made to feel so comfortable and nothing was a problem! I’d highly suggest going to an event there before hand, just to get a feel of what it’s like full of people and enjoy their delicious food. We actually enjoyed their entertainer ( singer) so much we hired him for our wedding ☺️
Lee priory is just so beautiful. I can’t speak highly enough x"
V19,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory on the 7th of September 2024. Considering how long they have been a wedding venue, they were pretty flexible with some of the ideas we had for the venue styling that turned out amazingly!

The staff really made the day something special and couldn't have done enough for us. Special mention must be made for Leanne, our wedding planner, who was amazing!

Highly recommend the venue and the incredible team that helped to make our day so special!"
V19,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in October 2024. This venue is stunning both inside and out with immaculately kept grounds and interior. The hospitality in the lead up to and on the day of the wedding was fantastic. The food was also brilliant. Another great perk of this venue is the amount of on site accommodation.

A couple of drawbacks / experiences during our wedding. There are only a few toilets in the main building which kept blocking and overflowing throughout the evening which led to us taking some guests to the dressing room or honeymoon cottage to use the facilities. You are also restricted by the venue on any external food or drink suppliers and the venues optional extras for this are quite expensive for what they are.

That asaide, we had the best day and evening at Leez Priory and would certainly recommend it!"
V19,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in August 2024- great venue and experience from initial viewing to leaving the morning after the wedding. Leanne acted as our wedding planner and was friendly, professional and helpful throughout. We opted for the classic package and the food was amazing quality with everyone commenting how full they were!
The venue is beautiful with several options for ceremony both inside and out. Accommodation was great too. The whole day ran smoothly with perfect weather - we will have very happy memories of our day!"
V19,Leez Priory,"Perfect venue and very attentive staff, lovely food and great communication from start to finish"
V19,Leez Priory,"Stunning venue. Fantastic Team. Very accommodating toward our unique ""surprise"" strategy. Our guests were truly surprised. Thank you."
V19,Leez Priory,"Leez priory was the 1st and only venue we looked around when we started planning our wedding. From the moment we stepped on the premises, everything just looked so perfect and exactly what we wanted from a wedding venue. When we got assigned our wedding co-ordinator Rachel, she was just absolutely spot on with everything we asked for and nothing was too big an ask for her. She made sure the day ran as smoothly as possible and took care of any issue that arose without me knowing (which I am forever grateful for!!)
The rest of the staff were amazing and very helpful.

The venue itself is just absolutely stunning and we loved that it has the pub area as well as the dance floor so it catered to all of our guests.

All of the rooms were lovely and it was so nice being able to stay in the fisherman’s lodge onsite the night before the wedding.

We genuinely cannot recommend this venue enough and it was 100% worth the money! 10/10!"
V19,Leez Priory,"We got married on a Tuesday in October to maximise the value of what we could get for our money; and honestly, we got everything we wanted and more. Leanne, our Wedding Manager was perfect at bringing an attention to detail and seamless organisation to the big day, and in the lead up. There wasn't one moment of the day where we felt stressed, as Leanne had it covered. In one particular instance, our flowers for the bridal party's hair hadn't arrived. Within five minutes of telling Leanne that we needed this, the flowers were with our hair and make-up suppliers to add the finishing touches.

Leez Priory as a venue is the most stunning setting, and offers an incredible range of areas in which the ceremony and reception can take place. There is also the opportunity for the bridal party to make use of the Fisherman's Cottage the night before the wedding, and for people to stay in the on-site accommodation on the evening of the wedding, making it the perfect venue for people also travelling from further afield.

Leez Priory were very accommodating, welcoming and were happy to work with us to make our day as perfect as possible. The food was incredible, and a total hit with all of our guests, and so many people have commented on how incredible the day was as a whole. You wouldn't be disappointed to choose Leez Priory."
V19,Leez Priory,They catered to our every need. To when we would ask for things they hadn’t been done before they still made sure it went smoothly. Leanne was amazing she made me feel so comfortable from the start. The whole day was stunning. Beautiful venue please go view it as you will not be disappointed
V19,Leez Priory,We got married on the 26 May 2024. This venue was absolutely brilliant! They catered for every need and made sure there was no stress on the day. Leanne was kind and level headed throughout and was always one step ahead! Do not hesitate to book- do it now!
V20,London Rowing Club,"We picked this place because we wanted somewhere fairly central and casual. We fell in love with the long room and the view. Our wedding was in October so we thought we'd have it cosy but we ended up with a beautiful autumnal day so everyone was on the balcony. The fairy lights were perfect and the other rooms were great to avoid leaving. The staff was so friendly and accommodating that we would definitely recommend the venue.

The only thing that could have tainted the day is that after three visits and many emails, we were never told that the river floods (a lot). We were flexible with our day so if we knew this we would have built it into our day, instead, I was told by the photographer on the day as I got out of the taxi that we wouldn't be able to take any group photos because the area would be flooded during the cocktail hour and half that we had assigned as photo time. This would have been disappointing but we all ended up running outside after the ceremony to take photos before the tide came in. My husband and I borrowed wellies for our couple photos. We had fun doing this, but I can imagine many couples being upset! My friend's electric car also flooded and they were obviously upset."
V20,London Rowing Club,"Annabel was meticulous in her help planning the wedding. Very knowledgeable and helpful.
On the day the rest of the staff were brilliant - there wasn’t an empty glass in the house.
Great venue at a reasonable price on the London riverside."
V20,London Rowing Club,"LRC was the perfect place to celebrate our wedding this summer. The venue staff went above and beyond to ensure that everything went as planned both before and during the event. Thanks in particular to Annabel who was responsive, helpful and always put us at ease in the build up. The location is stunning - couldn’t have asked for a better day!"
V20,London Rowing Club,"We just wanted to say an enormous thank you for everything. From the moment we came to visit the LRC on a slightly grey January weekend, we knew it would be a fabulous venue for our June wedding reception and it certainly did not disappoint. It really is the most beautiful setting and we have very fond memories of our guests enjoying drinks in the sunshine with the most fantastic view over the Thames. The venue has such character and lends itself beautifully to a wedding reception. We have received so many compliments from our guests and I would encourage anyone thinking about booking their wedding at the LRC to do it, you will not regret it! We were lucky to be blessed with beautiful weather so were able to have our jazz musicians play on the balcony for the drinks reception before moving into the Long Room for our meal. It looked stunning with the tables dressed and mantles adorned with flowers. Following the meal and speeches, guests enjoyed drinks back on the balcony and in the Fairburn and Members Rooms which provide plenty of seating, whilst the Long Room was cleared and the band set up. We then partied the night away.

From start to finish, the organisation was so straight forward. Annabel was very accommodating and full of helpful advice in the run up. I knew that on the day she would ensure things ran like clock work, which of course they did. Our suppliers also commented on how helpful the LRC team were to work with. On the day the staff were brilliant and went out of their way to ensure everything ran smoothly (including borrowing some large gym fans from the rowers to put in the Long Room to keep us cool as it was an unexpectedly hot day). We really can’t thank you enough and now need to think of an excuse to host another party with you in the future!"
V20,London Rowing Club,"We got married in St. Mary's church and then had our reception in the London Rowing Club in February 2023. It far exceeded our expectations and was an incredible fabulous stress-free day with thanks to the wonderful Annabel making the day just run.

In the lead up to the event, Annabel was incredibly responsive, helpful and helped us plan the day exactly how we wanted it. She answered all our questions really quickly, always got back to us, was very flexible with what we could do and allowing us to personalise the space. Prior to the event, Annabel arranged for us to go and have a look around on a couple of additional occasions to help us plan how we would want it to look. She also gave our caterers a tour of the kitchens as they were new to the venue.

In the immediate lead up to the day, Annabel helped with our suppliers in getting chairs delivered and bringing all the wine over a day earlier. On the day, she helped to make the day flow and just dealt with things throughout the day.

The venue itself is beautiful with three rooms to use. A middle reception room, a cosy snug and the main long room. In the main long room, there is a rowing boat hanging upside down with fairly lights. The main lighting can be dimmed and gave a wonderful atmosphere for the evening meal. As our wedding was a winter wedding, it was fairly chilly so they lit fires in the main room and snug which added to the atmosphere.

We had around 90 guests - could have fitted a few more just about. We used the round tables, tablecloths, linen, plates cutlery and glasses provided and they were perfect for a wedding and looked very smart. No need to hire these. As mentioned, we did hire separate wedding chairs instead of the conference chairs provided. There's a lot of decoration in the way of rowing memorabilia on the walls which means you don't have to actually do too much to make it interesting for guests.

Overall, the perfect London wedding venue with absolutely fabulous views across the Thames with a long balcony to enjoy from. To top it off Annabel is truly amazing and so helpful."
V20,London Rowing Club,"We had our wedding (ceremony+reception) at LRC in July, and the venue itself and the team we worked with were absolutely incredible! Everything on the day went without a hitch and we heard so many compliments on the location - our guests loved the balcony and the layout inside, which included plenty of space for anyone wanting a break from dancing to sit down and relax. Would recommend to anyone looking to host an event!"
V20,London Rowing Club,"London Rowing Club is a truly fantastic venue and we were both so delighted with how our day went! The venue has real character with the classic rowing memorabilia and it’s location on the Thames, and looks amazing when it’s all set up. The layout and size of rooms I thought were perfect for our wedding of about 70 (+15ish more in the evenings) and of course the big attraction is the balcony which all of our guests adored!! (I wish I’d had more time during the day to stand out there and enjoy it 😂). Not only is it a fantastic venue in a great location but what really made this the most amazing venue was how great all of the staff, and all the recommend suppliers were! The day exceeded expectations and we got compliments on the place and the staff from all our guests. Couldn’t be happier with the venue, it was perfect for us!!"
V20,London Rowing Club,"We found the London Rowing Club while desperately combing through London locations after our original venue fell through a few months before the day.
Luckily for us it was available due to a cancellation - kismet!
From the start the charming Annabel put us very much at ease and helped us to envisage the day as we hoped it would be. She was very flexible and helpful throughout the planning process.
We were incredibly lucky with the weather on the day and the venue really came into its own - it was virtually impossible to get guests off the terrace, which is the perfect size for our smallish event (65 people) and of course offers gorgeous river views.
We were well looked after by the team and everything went off without a hitch. The interior of the space itself is lovely with a great sense of history.
Nice additional touch - table tennis was made available in the entry room for the later part of the evening!

It's a special place and I'd thoroughly recommend for anyone seeking a memorable spot to tie the knot!"
V20,London Rowing Club,"We got married at the London Rowing Club on a brilliantly sunny winter day on Saturday. All the way through in the run up (after 2 years or more of postponements), Annabel and team bent over backwards to help us arrange everything, recommended some brilliant suppliers for food (Shona Pollock comes highly recommended) and flowers (same with Steph the charityflorist.)

So many of our guests said how lovely the venue and staff were on the day, and the whole place looked a million dollars with an amazing photo set on and around the balcony and river - although we haven't seen those yet. The corkage and bar tariff prices are also incredibly reasonable for an inner London location!

I can't recommend the LRC highly enough. It will live in memory for a very long time."
V20,London Rowing Club,"The London Rowing Club team alongside the Dinner Ladies went above and beyond to ensure that we had the wedding perfectly fitting our requirements. Throughout the entire all of the suppliers worked seamlessly together to ensure the space transformed as we progressively added guests and transitioned between eating, our ceremony, more eating, music and dancing. We wouldn’t have had it any other way. The attention to detail of the team is second to none - perfect for any bride and groom seeking a beautiful event."
V21,The Prince Albert,"The team at The Prince Albert were always accommodating, made everything easy and stress-free, and helped us organise an amazing wedding party. They really knew what they were doing, and helped guide us through the process calmly, working around our schedule (which wasn't easy - we live abroad!) to make sure all our last-minute worries and concerns were sorted smoothly. The food was excellent, and the space was fantastic for our party. Can't recommend it highly enough!"
V21,The Prince Albert,"We had such a happy wedding with Harrison and this venue. Harrison was really flexible and answered any questions we had and made great suggestions when we needed seating arrangements, the schedule for the day, a florist, and more. The day was accessible to everyone and the food and drink were perfect. Thank you for making out wedding stress free and wonderful."
V21,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert was the most wonderful venue for our London wedding. We came across the venue at there wedding fair and chose alot of our suppliers from the same wedding fair.

Harrison and Lauren were always so on hand to help with any questions and did a fantastic job answering all of our questions. The staff were so friendly and helpful and made everything run like clockwork.

We couldn’t recommend The Prince Albert enough for a london wedding and would love to do it all again."
V21,The Prince Albert,"My wife and I were beyond happy with how everything went on our wedding day. Harrison, Diana, Claudio and the whole team were absolutely phenomenal! It was such a beautifully efficient operation, and we always felt like someone was there to help us when needed.

We've had dozens of compliments about the great food and how wonderfully intimate the venue was for a wedding. Some of our more traditional relatives said they were initially sceptical at the prospect of a pub wedding, but that it was one of the most beautiful and joyful weddings they’d been to. A friend of mine was also very happy that someone at the bar remembered her drink order throughout the evening! On top of that, everything ran perfectly to schedule, which is no doubt down to the high attention to detail.

It was very useful that the upstairs was free on Friday afternoon so that we could set up the space. It gave us plenty of time to do the flower arrangements, put up the bunting, and stick photos on the frame wall.

Thank you again so much for all the help and support you've given us - it really was the best day of our lives (so far)!"
V21,The Prince Albert,"My husband and I got married here in late September 2023, and I cannot recommend the Prince Albert enough!! Booking a wedding venue can be stressful and we felt like a lot of the venues we looked at gave us the ""hard sell"" but the folks at the Prince Albert helped to put us at ease every step of the way. We fell in love with how beautiful the pub was, so hired the upstairs for the ceremony, wedding breakfast and party afterwards for around 40 - 45 people. We were able to drop off decorations the night before and talk it all through with the staff, and they did such a good job of working with us and the florist to get the place looking amazing. The ceremony went off without a hitch, everybody loved the food and we had a blast in the evening. All the staff were amazing, but special shout out to Harrison and Lauren for helping us plan and run the day, and Maria for managing everything on the ground both when we dropped off the decorations and during the wedding itself. Thank you again for helping us celebrate our special day with our loved ones, for making it so stress free and so memorable!"
V21,The Prince Albert,"All you ever hear about wedding venues is that everything is a rip off, the food is meh, and there are a ton of annoying restrictions...the opposite is true of Harrison and The Prince Albert team. From Day 1, Harrison made the whole process not only easy but really fun! He was quick to respond, super knowledgeable, and very accommodating; he even helped our best man execute a surprise for us without it disrupting any timings. On the day, they decorated the place beautifully, managed to serve a 3 course dinner to 76 people unbelievably fast, and everyone raved about the food - to say they did a good job is a gross understatement, they went above and beyond. We were after ""classy fun"" and that's exactly what we got - thank you so so much!"
V21,The Prince Albert,"We had the exact wedding reception we wanted at the Prince Albert thanks to Harrison, Claudio and the other amazing staff who helped us feel so relaxed in the build up and during. We wanted a very low-key vibe and the team understood that but there were enough options for any style of wedding you wanted. The upstairs function room felt cozy and intimate while still leaving breathing room and space to dance, but you could easily rent the whole place if you wanted more guests and even choose to do your ceremony there. We had the most compliments on our food (we chose a buffet option). The team were particularly accomodating to some complicated dietary requirements and it was all delicious."
V21,The Prince Albert,"July 6, 2023 was the most memorable day of our lives! A big thank you to Harrison and the rest of the team for assisting us through out the whole process. Our guests loved the Prince Albert pub especially the sumptuous food and booze on our wedding day!

David & Dannah"
V21,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert is a Great venue for the classic Pub Wedding.
Harrison and the team did an amazing job to organize everything. The food was great and the service first class. Only sorry it was over so quickly. Thanks again for everything."
V21,The Prince Albert,"We found The Prince Albert when our original venue cancelled on us less than 2 months before our wedding. & we are so glad we did; everything happens for a reason! From the moment we met Harrison, we knew we were in safe hands, and the team at the Prince Albert made our day amazing. The pub looked beautiful and we were very greatful for the effort the team put in putting up all our decorations. We had so many compliments about the food, and we were very impressed in the swift and organised manner in whichever it was served. Everyone had a wonderful time, and we would not hesitate in recommending The Prince Albert."
V22,Kindred,"We chose Kindred for our 60 person wedding and it could not have been better. We wanted a venue where we could have the ceremony, dinner and dancing all under one roof, that was wheelchair accessible, and easy to get to on the tube, Kindred ticks all those boxes and more!
The food is incredible, we really enjoyed popping by to do all the tastings, we'll continue to come to the Cellar for food and cocktails. Many guests commented on how good the food was.
The place itself is gorgeous, inside and out. We used the whole venue, the main Hall for the ceremony, dinner and dancing, and the Library upstairs for the drinks reception and cake cutting. Also, being right next to Hammersmith station, the venue could not be easier to get to!
The staff are wonderfully attentive and helpful, both before and on the day. They were really open to the little details that made our day uniquely ours, from the drinks selections, to having a table and glasses on stage for the ceremony, to playing our music selections at the right time. Plus its a dog friendly venue!"
V22,Kindred,"We LOVE this venue! We got married here with only 12 weeks notice and Anna, the owner, and her staff went above and beyond to make the day as memorable, magical, and marvellous as we'd hoped it would be. The venue is elegant, stylish and perfect for a London, city based wedding. The food is sensational as it comes from their in-house kitchen on the ground floor and every guest remarked on how delicious their meal was. It's restaurant quality food, not your standard wedding food. The place looks stunning in all our wedding photos and the wedding cake they made us (at very short notice I might add!) was second to none. Everyone loved it. The venue was also perfect for late night dancing and drinking and merriment. It was such a pleasure - and a breeze - to work with Anna and her team on one of the most important days of my life, and I very much hope to do so again in the future. I will forever be grateful to her and all she helped us with."
V22,Kindred,"We had our wedding reception for 35 guests at Kindred, in the Library and Salon earlier this year. The day went incredibly smoothly, the staff couldn't have been more attentive and our guests raved about the food for weeks afterwards. It was the perfect sized space for our intimate celebration, really cosy and the atmosphere was great. The little touches really helped to make the day special, with espresso martinis served for the speeches and sparklers for our exit at the end of the night. Thanks again to the lovely Kindred team!"
V22,Kindred,"I cannot find a single fault in our experience with Kindred for our wedding. Not only was it a stunning venue that honestly made some of our guests gasp as they arrived, but Anna and the team were so incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. Having them support us really took so much of the wedding planning stress away and we knew we were in safe hands. I really appreciated that the team were happy to chat through ideas with me and were always keen to find creative solutions to give us the day that we had envisioned.

The food was absolutely delicious and they were so accommodating for our long list of dietary requirements from our guest. The cocktails were also so delicious. Our guests were buzzing for weeks after, as were we.

On the night, the staff were not only incredibly helpful and efficient, but also just so friendly, welcoming and complimentary. We felt thoroughly spoilt and very well looked after.

We visited so many venues and this was by far the best choice for us. The interiors made for some stunning photos and the layout of the spacing meant that whilst we had 80-100 guests, it still felt very intimate. I cannot recommend Kindred enough!"
V22,Kindred,"We would give a thousand stars if we could. Kindred hosted us for our cocktail style wedding and it was everything we could have hoped for and the perfect venue for this style of wedding. The wine, cocktails and food (incredible grazing board, canapés, bowls and pizzas) were exceptional and the team were on top of everything, friendly and nothing was ever an issue. We would HIGHLY recommend it. We have had loads of guests message us to tell us what a spectacular venue it was with the most friendly team. The venue had different spaces to suit our needs and the AV is amazing - it worked perfectly for our live music band and our DJ, and our own music playlists for our ceremony. They took the stress off planning and really did mean we could relax and not worry that everything would run smoothly. Thank you so much Kindred team for giving us the best day of our lives"
V23,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The best day of our lives and me and my now husband couldn't be more thankful to Bredenbury. Before booking Bredenbury we visited over 17 wedding venues in Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Herefordshire - we fell in love instantly, there is no need for a crazy amount of extra expense on decorations, the venue speaks for itself. The fact that it was no corkage just added to why we wanted to book and the team were so friendly. In the lead up to the wedding they were brilliant, we booked far in advance and brought over all our family members to come see the venue, they were so flexible, understanding and welcoming - they couldn't do enough for us. On the wedding day they had decorated for us by the time we had arrived and all we had to do on the day was to enjoy it - which was perfect. It really was the best day of our lives, all the comments from our family and friends was how beautiful the venue was. They kept the day running so smooth and we didn't need to think about a thing."
V23,Bredenbury Court Barns,"There truly aren't words to describe how incredible Bredenbury Court Barns and their entire team of fantastic staff were through the planning process and the day itself. They were so friendly, supportive and nothing was ever too much. From quick replies to any questions that popped to mind to planning meetings that left us feeling prepared and ready to the day being set up beyond perfectly. Our amazing wedding coordinator Lianna spent the days and months (years really!) leading up to our big day making sure everyone detail was perfect, that everything was incorporated that we'd dreamed of and made sure we didn't feel a moment of stress from start to finish. All throughout the building from the bridal booth, to the orangery to the oak barn was beautifully light and open - even with our wedding being the end of October - and we had so many compliments about this! There aren't enough words to say thank you and explain just how much we'd recommend this venue to everyone"
V23,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We had the perfect day back in July. The weather didn't go to plan but they helped make the day so special even with the last minute switches because of the rain. We had such an amazing day and the feedback from our guests about the venue, food and service was great! We cannot thank the team enough for the effort they put in throughout the whole process but especially on the day. We felt incredibly supported throughout the whole process."
V23,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The venue itself is stunning. The buildings, grounds and interior decorations are all beautiful and immaculately presented. From the moment you turn down the lane it is so picturesque, you know you've found somewhere special. It's exactly what we were imagining for our wedding venue.

The layout is perfect, with ample space for guests to mingle and move about, and great accessibility for older and disabled guests. Ours was a winter wedding, and while most of the day was inside it wasn't cramped and we could still enjoy the beautiful grounds through the expansive windows that run along the whole barn.

All of the venue is stunning, but practicality-wise the Bridal Suite warrants a special mention. Room length mirrors, plenty of room for the bridal party to get ready, have their makeup and hair done, and if there's time to relax as well. Drinks were served from 11 onwards, and it has it's own toilets and shower.

From our first meeting at Bredenbury the staff were exceptional. They gave a reassuring air of professionalism and experience, with just the right level of excitedness for our day without it feeling forced. We were really impressed by how responsive the whole team were, with speedy replies to any questions we had during the planning. This is something we particularly appreciated as we only gave ourselves 7 weeks to plan our big day.

Value for money wise it felt tricky to gauge when we were trying to choose a venue as the headline figure is rarely what you'll end up paying, with different venues charging different amounts for different things. Not the case with Bredenbury. With their No Corkage policy and generosity in being able to use whatever props they already have, any extras were non-essentials of our own choosing.

No Corkage is pretty significant. Some venues wanted to charge £20/bottle, so not having to pay this and being able to supply not only our own wine but beers, gin and soft drinks for the drinks reception and wedding breakfast was not only a massive saving but also made the occasion more personal for us. The bar staff and catering team were excellent, pouring and serving drinks, warming our mulled wine and setting up the gin bar. Once your guests have drunk you dry the venue's bar is well stocked and standard pub pricing.

We wanted a Christmas wedding and seeing in early November that they had a date available that December we couldn't resist. 7 weeks isn't long to organise a wedding with nearly 100 guests, and we couldn't have done it without the Bredenbury team being so organised. Our assigned event manager, Harriet, was brilliant in the runup and on the day, as were all the other managers and staff we spoke with. The Wedding Bible they fill out with you is a great idea and nails down all the finer details to ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible on the day.

We didn't want to have to spend the day before and morning of our wedding worrying about set up and decorations, but needn't have worried as Bredenbury did all of this for us. A meeting beforehand clarified what we wanted where; we simply dropped off boxes of stuff the day before and rocked up in the morning to find everything laid out as hoped.

This organisation extended to the third party suppliers, of which Bredenbury have an extensive list of local recommendations. We booked the ceiling lights with Cotswold Wedding Co. and didn't have to do anything else. The band, Apollo Gold (incredible!!) set up without any hassle and didn't have any issues with Bredenbury's noise limiter. Our florist Katrina Bevis hadn't been there before, but again had no problem getting everything in place on the morning.

On-site accommodation was good for close family and friends, but there's not enough for the majority of guests and the lack of a dedicated honeymoon suite is a bit of a shame. If you want privacy for your first night as a married couple it means taking over an entire lodge. The quality and comfort of the rooms is excellent, though, and the continental breakfast served the morning after in the East Lodge was delicious, with ample options for Vegan and Gluten Free.

Jenkinsons are the exclusive caterer for Bredenbury and have an extensive menu for nibbles, the wedding breakfast and dinner. The menu and ordering process is clear, and pricing is what we expected to pay. Food and service was as slick and faff-free as everything else. A real delight.

On the day, Harriet and the catering manager were absolute superstars. Zero stress, everything ran to time and as planned, and they were always available if we had any questions or needed help.

The whole day was perfect and exactly what we wanted. I don't think we could have achieved this without the exceptional organisation of Harriet and the team. The entire process was very slick, zero stress, and we wouldn't hesitate in recommending Bredenbury Court Barns to anyone looking to get married in a countryside paradise."
V23,Bredenbury Court Barns,"I want to say a massive thank you to Bredenbury Court Barns for hosting our wedding. From the start they were super amazing and accommodating to us. They won us over with their care and support even when we had a pickle in the beginning.

Olivia was super helpful from the start and throughout the year we were planning she offered huge amount of support and suggestions.

We typed in “orangery weddings” in google when we were first looking because I was keen to get a ceremony in an orangery and Bredenbury popped up after much searching. Once we saw the Orangery we cancelled every other viewing we had across the country because we felt we found the perfect place, and nothing compared to the reception with the beautiful windows that brought all the light in. The grounds were absolutely spectacular and gorgeous. It was a no brainer for us to pick such a beautiful venue. They brought my ideas to life and we were able to get support on anything from recommendation of suppliers, to ideas on decor to their favourite meals from Jenkinson’s. They fully outdid themselves in love for us. We can’t forget it.

Our wedding day was exceptional with Lianna helping us all the way. She was a breath of fresh air. She cared about all the little details and made us feel relaxed and had a good laugh with us. The fact she was there 100% of the way, before the wedding, during the wedding, and even after is unmatched! Thank you Lianna for really being there to make our wedding day smooth and relaxing.

The food was incredible too and we often think about how sad it is that we didn’t finish our second plates, we think about it a lot.

Thank you for the wonderful journey BCB, you blew us away with your integrity, kindness, and genuine support!"
V23,Bredenbury Court Barns,thank you to everyone at bredenbury court barns who made our day so special
V23,Bredenbury Court Barns,"From the moment we stepped foot into Bredenbury Court Barns, we knew this was the venue for us. It was the first and only venue we viewed as we were blown away by how gorgeous the venue is. The venue itself is absolutely stunning, with breathtaking views and impeccably maintained grounds that set the perfect backdrop for our special day.

The staff went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. From our first consultation to the last dance, their professionalism and attention to detail were exceptional. Harriet was absolutely brilliant and I don’t know what we would have done without her!

The food was another highlight—our guests are still talking about how delicious everything was! Jenkinsons are amazing, they helped us personalise our menu perfectly!

We couldn’t have asked for a more beautiful venue to have our wedding. The day couldn’t have been more perfect! Thank you to everyone at Bredenbury Court Barns for making our wedding day nothing short of magical!"
V23,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We could not have had a more perfect experience with Bredenbury Court Barns. Right from initial booking all the way through to breakfast the following morning, everything was perfect. Nothing was too much trouble for our wonderful planner, Lianna. She ensured the day ran smoothly and our months of planning turned out exactly as we’d imagined. They are available to answer any questions you have any time, they’re only an email away and get back to you so fast. The venue itself if just gorgeous, the grounds make for some wonderful photos, and the orangery lets so much light in that your ceremony photos are gorgeous. The whole place is fully air conditioned too which was great for our July wedding. The bridal suite is a perfect balance of being aesthetically pleasing and practical for getting ready in, it’s so spacious, lots of natural light, there’s plenty of plug sockets and huge mirrors so everyone has plenty of room for getting ready and no one is on top of eachother. There’s even an outside space for getting some fresh air. I’m so glad we chose to have our wedding here, it’s given us memories to cherish forever and there are zero memories of any stress!! Cannot recommend this venue enough!"
V23,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We cannot believe how lucky we fell to get married at such a beautiful venue. Right from the offset of viewing the venue, to our special day, we were taken of. No question was too silly, and so much pressure was taken off us during the planning. We managed to make everything our own and Lianna was there every step of the way. Thank you for giving us our happily ever after. We will forever be grateful."
V23,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We loved our wedding at Bredenbury the team did an amazing job providing everything we asked for and more. We especially liked that our wedding coordinator for the day, Harriet had thought of everything for us she went above and beyond and even offered to go and get my mum some more shoes when hers broke! absolute 5-star service and the food was amazing too!"

V25,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow what can I say, Brinsop is an absolutely stunning wedding venue with heaps of character and so many options of places for the ceremony and to do things. We fell in love with it as soon as we saw it and knew it was where we wanted to get married.

Right from the start, the Brinsop team were so helpful and accommodating. From giving an virtual tour then showing us around in person, Issy and the team were fantastic right the way through. Nothing was a hassle, no request too difficult and they were incredibly professional and responsive throughout the whole process.

We loved that Brinsop is an exclusive venue with accommodation on site so we could stay with the bridal party and our immediate family. All the rooms are unique and have so much character and it's fun exploring the whole place. You feel like you are in the middle of nowhere, in nature with swans, ducks and birds all around.

Throughout our planning process, Issy and the team helped us every step of the way, being incredibly flexible in managing our requests and really trying to create our vision. They even got their team to make a giant jenga that we could use on the day! They helped to create the most perfect bespoke wedding breakfast and canapes menu, and seemed so positive and excited to be part of our special day and experience.

Arriving at the venue, Issy and the team were ready and had everything prepared and ready to go. It made the process so smooth for us and meant we could really enjoy the day without any stress. Issy coordinated perfectly with all of our vendors and it really felt like she and the whole team were so happy for us and wanted to be part of our day which was amazing. Our guests commented on how friendly and responsive all the staff were and it really made the experience extra special.

I wouldn't change anything about the day and it was perfect. I would absolutely recommend Brinsop as a wedding venue and all the staff who are really invested in helping deliver your vision. Thank you so so much to the whole team for making this a day that we will look back on for many years to come with amazing memories."
V25,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow, what a perfect day we had! It really went without a hitch and that was thanks to Nina and all the staff at Brinsop. The team worked seamlessly to ensure the day was as perfect as could be, and it really was! The wedding was booked over 2 years in advance and the staff were so accommodating with all my questions, planning and site visits, they couldn’t do more to support us. Special thanks to our coordinator Nina who was a delight to work with and a credit to Brinsop. Everyone that attended agreed at how beautiful the venue and grounds were, it was a wedding people won’t forget! 10/10 would recommend to anyone!"
V25,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"It's taken me quite a while to get round to writing this review, because sadly it's quite a bittersweet one.

We were married last year on 15 June and Brinsop was our chosen venue for both our ceremony and reception. We were first attracted to brinsop by the accomodation, meaning our loved ones could stay on-site, especially my grandparents which was so important to me.

The home itself is absolutely beautiful, including ivy cottage which myself and my mum stayed in the night before the big day. It really was a picture perfect setting, and looking down from the bridal suite seeing the ceremony space being set up on the Wordsworth lawn was honestly magical. Id dreamed of an outdoor wedding on that lawn, and we were so grateful the weather cleared so we could have it. The team really did wait till the latest they could to ask us to make a call on an inside or outside wedding (despite being June, it was a gloomy day to start) which I really appreciated!

Another amazing part of hiring brinsop was the after hours space we were able to enjoy until 2am with our house guests. The games room was absolute fantastic and meant that if you wanted to go to bed you could, but you could also stay up, party and play pool. I really do think this was a highlight for our guests and would recommend massively if you can spare some budget.

On the night of the wedding, myself and my new husband actually stayed in one glamping tents which we absolutely loved. The groundsman was on site until we were ready to leave the games room, and he then took us up to our tent in one of the buggies, making sure we had plenty of blankets and even stopping off for some bottles of water for us. This was really special, and can't thank him enough.

Hugo Spritz!! Having hugos at both our welcome drinks and drinks reception after the ceremony was amazing. I'm not a fan of prosecco myself and Mark and the team made it possible for us to have Hugo's all round. We even sneaked some up to the bridal suite to have before the ceremony (thanks Nadia!). Our guests loved them, and the amount of people that have told me they now need them at their own wedding is crazy!

Onto the not so good - sadly it all started to go a little downhill when we moved things into the knot barn for our wedding breakfast. Sitting on the top table, I could see that guests at the top of the second rows of long tables didn't really even have a seat around the table and were just kind of plonked on. The seating plan hadn't been followed, and I don't think there were even enough tables laid for the service to be comfortable for people because there was a dance floor at the end of the barn (which I did not ask for).

It was quickly also brought to my attention, that one of our guests had had to put her child on her lap in order to remove the high chair so people had more space. We also lost about 5 napkins with them setting on fire from the candles because everything was just way too cramped.

I asked to speak to catering, and asked if there was anything that they could do. I was told 'well sure, if you want the whole thing to be late'. In truth I shouldn't have even had to broach this myself, as it should have been sorted by the coordination team.

The tables weren't changed, even after they'd said they'd sort after the first course and yet the whole meal still ran late. We've had so much feedback about people not having enough food, food not being easy to access on the sharing platters etc and honestly when you've waited so long for a day and had spent 25k on the venue and food alone, it really has been heartbreaking to hear. I do sometimes question why people still bring it up (even now, people talk about the dining) when it clearly upset me so much.

Whilst writing this review my husband asked my what we had for evening food - we didn't get any. It was left unannounced on a back table. I don't know what I was expecting, just not that.

The next morning, the houseguests were asked to come down to breakfast for 9am (it was on a note in the room) but as we were in the glamping area, we walked past the knot barn just before 8.30 and the food was already out. We ran down to the house to hurry everyone up, and by which time everyone arrived it had been sitting there for 20plus mins going cold.

My biggest upset was that when I fed all of the above back to brinsop, feeling pretty deflated about the catering, I was told they'd pass my feedback on and heard absolutely nothing back. 25k total with over 10k on food and drinks to hear absolutely nothing, and this was 9 months ago. I'm not saying this in would happen to anyone else, but really - it shouldn't have happened to us either."
V25,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our wedding! From start to finish, everything at Brinsop was flawless. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most magical backdrop for our special day. Our guests were blown away by the beautiful venue, the warm atmosphere, and the seamless coordination. Every detail was taken care of, and we felt so well looked after. The team was incredible, professional, friendly, and attentive. On the day itself, they ensured everything ran smoothly, allowing us to truly enjoy every moment. A special mention goes to our amazing wedding coordinator Nina!"
V25,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We had our wedding on New Year's Eve 2024 at Brinsop, and it was more perfect that we could have ever hoped for. The venue itself is stunning, with beautiful spacious rooms which slept over 40 of our guests. Our coordinator, Nina, was incredible and so supportive on the day - she kept everything running so smoothly and everything went by without a glitch. The food and drink managers Mark and Amy did the most incredible job - nothing was ever too much, they were so attentive, and the chefs the most stunning meal after we gave them a fairly vague brief of 'curry'! We had the most perfect day and we're so incredibly grateful to Brinsop and the team."
V25,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,Brinsop Court is pure magic—an unforgettable venue with an incredible team!
V25,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We were lucky enough to have our wedding at Brinsop Court in December, and it was an absolutely spectacular day. We fell in love with Brinsop as soon we set our eyes on the beautiful manor and surrounding gardens. Cate, Amy, Mark and the rest of the wonderful staff at Brinsop really go the extra mile to make you feel special, and are extremely flexible with requests in order to make your day feel more special. We honestly felt like there was no request too big leading up to the day and they really made us feel extremely comfortable leading up to the day.
On the day, Cate and her team were well on hand to help us with setting up everything and she had everything under control when there were a few hiccups. The day itself was absolutely magical, and that wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for everyone at Brinsop working extremely hard to ensure that everything went to plan and as smoothly as it could.
Thank you to everyone at Brinsop for making us feel at ease and ensuring that our wedding was an amazing day."
V25,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Brinsop, the perfect wedding venue! We got married at Brinsop in December and I can honestly say it was everything we could have hoped for and more. We found out about the venue through Hitched and was one of only two venues that we visited but as soon as we got the house we knew it was the one. We fell in love with everything about it and it was fair to say that our guests agreed with us with many saying it was the nicest venue they’d been to. We had the wonderful Nina as our coordinator and she was brilliant! Nothing was too much trouble and we had constant communication with her in the build up which helped our stress levels no end. The same can be said for all of the staff who were brilliant throughout and allowed us to have the best day of our lives with everything running seamlessly. A special mention must be given to Amy and the catering staff who put on such an incredible menu (including the tasting session that provided some of the best food we’d ever had) and ensured that the food has been one of the main things that people have mentioned to us since the wedding! We had our ceremony in the Banqueting Hall which provided the perfect setting, especially with it being a winter wedding, as it really added to the cosy atmosphere and the lounge areas/games room were perfect for the drink’s reception. We would have loved to have also had it in the courtyard, but the temperatures meant that the lounge with the fireplace was a far more appealing option on the day. We then had the wedding breakfast and reception in the knot barn which was decorated beautifully and was the perfect place for the party in the evening. Overall we really can’t thank everyone at Brinsop enough for making our day what it was, we can honestly say that we have been made to feel part of the family and already can’t wait to hopefully come back to stay in one of the cottages for our first anniversary!"
V25,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Where do I start!!
Brinop Court is the most stunning venue, it was the first venue we visited and instantly fell in love! Theres so much history to the house and we were treated like family every time we visited before the wedding and it literally felt like home the whole weekend of the wedding, my guests also agreed!!

A special thank you to Issy our coodinator who went above and beyond ti make sure everything was perfect for us. It was so easy to plan and nothing was too much to ask, even arranging our dog to be our ring bearer!! When they say Brinsop is dog friendly they really mean it!!!

What a place, what a day!! Thank you so much everyone, you all made our day perfect and it really was the best day of our lives♥️"
V25,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We got married at the gorgeous Brinsop in October this year. It’s hard to put into words how amazing the whole experience was. We honestly had the best day of our lives!!!

We fell in love with Brinsop during our first visit back in December 2022. We knew almost immediately that Brinsop was the venue we were looking for! From the outside the venue looked like a painting - from the picturesque views of the countryside, to the swans swimming on the moat! The manor house itself has so much character, and has a lovely homely feel to it as you walk around it. Our guests were equally blown away by the venue!

A big thing for us was that it’s dog friendly, which meant we could have our two dogs join us on our special day, it wouldn’t have been the same without them there! They had so much fun walking around the grounds and greeting all of our guests!

Nina, our coordinator, and her team were always available to answer any of our questions in the run up to the day. This really put us at ease, knowing we were in safe hands. On the day, Nina and the team made sure everything ran smoothly and went above and beyond to ensure our guests were looked after. A shout out to Amy who heads up catering and Mark who manages the bar. The food and drinks were absolutely fantastic!

I highly recommend this venue! There’s a reason Brinsop is an award winning venue - and when you visit it’s not hard to see why. We are already looking forward to going back there for a date night next year! Thanks for everything Team Brinsop!

V26,The Manor at Bickley,"The Manor is the perfect venue for weddings! When our wedding venue fell through 4 months before the big day, I stumbled onto the Manor at Bickley and spoke to Craig. He was most helpful and kind and went above and beyond to make sure our wedding went ahead.

We hired the venue for our two day wedding and the staff were helpful and accommodating from start to finish. All of our guests were awed by the beautiful well kept grounds and the excellent service. We can’t thank the staff enough for making our wedding dreams a reality. They thought of every detail from bringing us champagne after our civil ceremony to making sure we had our card box at the end of the night! We are excited to head back to celebrate our anniversary there!"
V26,The Manor at Bickley,"Myself and my Husband chose this venue for our wedding last week and we can’t sing The Manor’s praises enough. From our very first enquiry, to the first viewing of the venue, right though until the big day, the staff at the manor have been nothing short of brilliant! Each staff member we came across was polite and accommodating. Special mention to Craig and Vicky with whom we did most of our liaising throughout the months leading up until our wedding. Craig and Vicky were super helpful, responsive and went above and beyond to make sure that we could have the day of our dreams. Even with last minute changes due to the weather, Craig who was just incredible throughout, managed to help us sort a backup plan so our day would still go ahead seamlessly.

The rooms at the manor were spacious and modern, giving us and our wedding party lots of space for photographers and videographers to capture the special moments on our wedding morning.

The lodge that was used for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready was fabulous. The manor was very flexible in giving us early access so we could get ready on time.

The grand marquee was definitely grand! Very spacious and when decorated looked like something out of a fairytale! lots of kitchen space, a huge bar and fantastic overhead speakers for the party!

The manor was super flexible to our needs regarding access, start times, outsourcing our vendors and much more. The venue is beautiful and spacious with options for outdoor and indoor events and entertainment. The grounds were absolutely beautiful, so many lovely spots for photos not only for us as the bride and groom but for guests too!

A very special thank you to our point of contact throughout, Craig. From our first meeting, he was charming, bubbly and made us feel super welcome. He reassured us that he has experience in African/Caribbean weddings and that our wedding day would amazing and it was. He was attentive and always let us know that he was only a phone call or e-mail away and was always quick to respond and answer any questions we had.

All in all, we had the most beautiful day at The manor and we would definitely recommend this venue for a wedding or other events.

V26,The Manor at Bickley,"We hired The Manor at Bickley for my daughters wedding. Got a brilliant service from the venue. Everything was set accordingly, as per floor plan. Our guests were loved the venue grounds/facilities and the overall wedding set up.

V27,Davenport House,We are so pleased we chose Davenport House for our wedding reception. Charley and the team were so helpful and thoughtful. Putting canapés behind the bar for us and making sure everything ran so smoothly. I am obsessed with the stunning house and grounds and it was absolutely perfect! Thank you so much for making our day so special!!
V27,Davenport House,"Davenport House is a STUNNING wedding venue so how could we not have it for our big day!?

The staff were exceptional! From the moment we booked through to our big day, we had an absolute blast and could not thank each member of staff enough! Special shout out to Jared (hopefully spelt right, haha!) who made sure we were fed, watered and ensured we took 5 minutes to ourselves every moment we could - Also even saved us slices of pie wedding cake before we went to bed!

Our guests have said they have never been to a wedding so spectacular, with the most amazing food and amazing staff so could not have been happier having Davenport as our venue! 🩷"
V27,Davenport House,"I just wanted to write to say a huge, enormous thank you to Charley and all the team at Davenport House. We still can’t believe how perfect our day was, and lots of our guests have told us it’s the best wedding they’ve ever been to. The team were all a huge part of making that happen. It was incredibly seamless and well planned on the day, meaning we genuinely didn’t have to think about a thing, except for enjoying ourselves. The day ran to schedule perfectly and even certain touches we didn’t know or expect to happen were planned by you and the team, which made the day even more special. Thank you so much for giving us our dream wedding day. We can’t wait to see the full set of pictures and the video now to relive it all!"
V27,Davenport House,"Without doubt the best day of our lives. From start to finish, Davenport has exceeded expectations. From the very first impression of the venue during the open day, the incredible food tasting evening, all the way through to the day itself, including the support and preparation leading up to it. It was really important to us to pick a venue that not only ticked the fairytale box, but also come with the complete support of a wedding planner, due to our busy jobs. We were lucky enough to have Charley as ours. She really took the time to listen and get to know us, to ensure the day was tailored to exactly what we wanted. We even had our own cocktail designed, which went down an absolute storm on the day! She considered every little detail, constantly putting our minds at ease, which made the whole process so easy and enjoyable. Honestly the day couldn’t have gone smoother, any anxiety or stress faded immediately as soon as we got to the venue. It was simply perfect. So many of our guests were complimentary of just how beautiful the venue is and just how well organised the day was, and that is the perfect way to summarise Davenport. Any prospective couples thinking of selecting Davenport as their venue, hesitate no further. It will be a day you never knew was possible! We cannot thank you enough Charley and the Davenport team, if only we could live the day over and over again"
V27,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was amazing. When looking for a venue we weren't just looking for something wow, we needed to have people who were enthused and passionate about their work - we found that at Davenport House.

From our first phone call & meeting with Lizzie and Tallulah, we knew this was the place for us. Having two brides wasn’t an issue; combining British, Asian and Spanish cultures - wasn't an issue; having brides enter together – wasn’t an issue. Nothing was an issue. At Davenport House, we got it all – a picturesque venue and the best team of staff anyone could ever wish for. All our external suppliers have commented what a fantastic venue you are. All out guests have said that the service and attention to detail was second to none. The thoughtful touches like hiring a Spanish speaking waiter for the table which spoke very little English ensured that everyone felt welcomed. Guests with dietary requirements didn't feel they got a second rate meal or they were an afterthought - the food for all throughout the day was exceptional. The rooms / cottages where our guests and we stayed, spotless and comfortable. The thought behind adding some cheese and Spanish ham to the morning breakfast - so sweet!

Special shout out to Megan - wedding planner extraordinaire who kept in touch throughout the planning process and was exceptional on the day. Ian who worked tirelessly to ensure the day ran smoothly and the food was perfect, Charley who was also in charge of one bride and ensuring that everything was on point. All the staff were fantastic - polite, professional and personal.

Everyone keeps saying that this was the best wedding they have ever attended and that’s a lot of weddings between people! When we asked why, they say things like ‘the venue’, ‘the staff’, but it all came back to the inclusivity, love & joy that they felt – and you were all a part of that.

Davenport House is a stunning venue made even better by those who work there. If you want the whole package on your wedding day, we strongly recommend you book them.

Thank you to the entire Davenport House team.

Sat and Ana xx"
V27,Davenport House,"Where to begin with our beautiful venue and thanking the people who made it all happen! We got married in November at Davenport House and it was easily the best day of our lives. We chose Davenport because we wanted to host our cosy winter wedding in a big grand house in the country, with all the grandeur and class but to still feel like an intimate celebration with our family and closest friends, and it was perfect in delivering just that. It is utterly beautiful, the location was perfect and exactly what we wanted. The food was absolutely AMAZING, we had so many compliments from our guests and we are so grateful for the team in delivering such a fabulous wedding breakfast. Thank you so much to Lizzie who couldn’t do more to help us have our dream day, and Ian who delivered the best service to us and our guests (the pizza at 2am was very much appreciated)

Massive massive thank you to Charley our wedding planner, who was so so helpful throughout our wedding planning process and on the day, I can’t thank her enough. She was always there whenever I needed her, helped me so much with creating our dream day and I will be forever grateful to her for keeping me sane! Whenever I had any worries I knew she was just a phone call away, which helped me a lot when planning a wedding!

Charley, Lizzie and Ian thank you for everything - best team ever. Our day was seamless and it was all down to you and your incredible team.

V27,Davenport House,"Me and my (now) wife chose Davenport House as our wedding venue in mid 2022, to get married in September 2023, and it was the best decision we could have made. We looked at a range of Georgian style manor house type venues located in Cheshire, North Wales and the West Midlands areas. It blew all of the competition away in terms of the venue aesthetics, the balance in design (i.e. period characteristics vs modern design), the impressive condition of the property for its age plus what it offered for our wedding weekend.

Staff and service - In the UK, this is usually something that is average at best - if you're lucky. At Davenport House, the service from all staff was 10/10. I honestly don't think we've ever had better service for anything. We had a wedding planner from the start (Megan), who was an absolute saint and was fundamental in making the whole wedding a success. She was also instrumental in helping us find a way for our 'little' dog Bernie to be a part of the main event. Thanks Megan!

Accommodation - The fantastic condition, design and decor for Davenport House extends to all areas of the estate. The rooms are fantastic, very big, well maintained and cleaned religiously by the venue. We had no issues or problems from all of the guests who stayed onsite over the 3 days.

Food and drink - This got a lot of deserved praise from the guests too. We got to tailor our entire menu and it worked perfectly for what we wanted for the 3 days. The oyster bar and luxurious charcuterie board went down particularly well the day before the wedding.

I could keep writing much, much more on how fantastic this venue was for our wedding. But the best advice I could give for any interested couples is to go and visit it in person and reach out to Davenport House with any questions. Our own wedding ended up becoming both perfect and the best wedding we've ever been to. Thanks guys again!"
V27,Davenport House,"Fantastic location.
Great staff.
Beautiful place to get married.
I can wait to film here again soon thanks for having me."
V27,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was a fairytale, everything we could have dreamed of and more. Lizzie and Charley were fantastic in their support, organisation and professionalism in planning our wedding. The venue is simply spectacular- breathtaking. Our guests were blown away. The day ran so smoothly it was simply perfect. The food was out of this world our guests couldn't get enough. All the staff at the house went above and beyond to ensure we were happy and having a great day. The team were also extremely supportive of last minute changes/additions. The Davenport experience was truly wonderful and I'm sad to see it end right from our initial meetings, food tasting and finally our special day. Thank you: Lizzie, Charley, Ian and all of the team for a truly memorable day for us and our guests. Mr and Mrs Kissane"
V27,Davenport House,"We got married at Davenport House in February and they provided us with the most perfect day. Lizzie, Charley, Ian and the rest of the team were the best hosts we could have hoped for. Nothing was too much to ask and the guests all commented on the hospitality shown to them. The setting is utterly gorgeous, our weather was less than favourable so we did not make the most of the grounds but this didn't matter, the house was setting enough and so atmospheric! The food was utterly AMAZING and better than most restaurant food I have eaten. The venue feels intimate and grand at the same time.
I literally cannot recommend this place enough, they gave us the wedding we had always wanted and more!"

V29,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge on 12 May 2023 and it was incredible. The views are gorgeous and the photo opportunities are endless with beautiful floral and green surroundings. The team were super responsive throughout the process which is really reassuring and helpful when planning a wedding, and Nelson who ran the day was just fantastic. Every single detail was thought of and they run a really slick operation. This is essential as it meant I had a lot less to think about! They put me and my partner at ease throughout. The food and service on the day was fantastic, so many of our guests said this was the best food they’ve ever had at a wedding. Highly recommend! (Photos by Costa Weddings UK)"
V29,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","Pembroke where super helpful and provided a lot of guidance in helpful forms and layouts. Always available for a call and very helpful. on the day, it ran super smooth and and staff where lovely. Thank yo for making it a great day!"
V29,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge in October 2024. The whole day was magical, including the beautiful view over the autumn trees in Richmond Park. Robert made sure everything ran perfectly and helped us to find slots in the busy wedding timetable to fit in some special moments to also reflect traditions from my husband's Dutch culture. The food was great and the staff were polite and fun. All preparation with Lucy was also smooth and done with a smile. The Pembroke Lodge team ooze experience but make every wedding feel special and really listen to your wishes for the day. Highly recommend! Thank you to the whole Pembroke Lodge team, especially Robert, Lucy, the kitchen team and the staff on the day!"
V29,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park",The staff has been very helpful. They have a lot of experience. Open to any suggestions and help in critical situations.
V29,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue than Pembroke Lodge for our summer wedding. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most gorgeous backdrop for our special day. A huge thank you to our banqueting manager, Nelson, who went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly.

The team was incredibly supportive and accommodating throughout the planning process, making it an enjoyable and stress-free experience. Their professionalism and attention to detail made all the difference, and we’re so grateful for everything they did to make our day unforgettable. Highly recommend!"
V29,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We got married on the 3rd of October this year, and the team made our day magical! What a smooth day. We loved every second of it! The guests loved everything, and raved about the food and organisation.
Hiring Pembroke Lodge was easy. We had a viewing where all information was shared in detail and super clear to understand and make a decision.
On the months leading up to the big day our contact was Alice. Alice is a star. Responsive, professional, and had answers and solutions to everything.
On the day, Nelson coordinated the whole thing, minute by minute, and we are forever grateful for his politeness, professionalism and high spirits. We felt safe and in good hands. I would give Pembroke Lodge way over 5 stars if I could :)"
V29,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","My wedding went without a hitch, thanks to the amazing team at Pembroke Lodge (special thanks to Nicola & Robert)! They made sure everything was set up perfectly on the day, exactly in the way we had requested, and then ensured the day itself went as smoothly as we could've hoped. Everything looked beautiful and the stunning views made all of our guests fall in love with the venue too."
V29,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had the most perfect day. The team have all been so responsive and accommodating of our every request. The venue is beautiful and we were lucky to have gorgeous sunset views. It is truly a countryside wedding but conveniently close to London, which was important for our overseas guests. The food was fantastic and staff were professional and efficient. Would recommend to anyone."
V29,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We recently had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge, and I cannot say enough good things about the venue, the team and manager, Robert. From the moment we started planning to the big day itself, he was absolutely incredible.

Robert went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. He was always available to answer our questions, offer solutions, and provide creative suggestions that enhanced our vision. He coordinated effortlessly with our vendors, making sure everyone was on the same page, which took so much stress off our shoulders.

On the day of the wedding, he was a true rockstar! He made sure the timeline flowed perfectly, from setting up the ceremony space to ensuring the reception transitions were seamless. His dedication and hands-on approach allowed us to enjoy every moment without worrying about a single thing.

Our wedding was a dream come true, and we owe so much of that to him and the team! Thank you, for everything you all did to make our day magical."
V29,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We could not have wished for a better wedding venue for our special day! Everyone went above and beyond to make sure our day goes perfectly without us having to worry about a single thing! A big shoutout to Nelson who was absolutely brilliant and made the day feel so calm and well thought through.

The food was delicious and all the team was so welcoming and super helpful on the day.

Thank you so much, we really really appreciate all the help!"
V30,The Hackney,"If you are having a wedding for under 60 people then this is your place! From start to finish the communication and planning of the wedding was seamless and took so much of the stress out of the day. The totally customisable packages that they offer really does suit anyone’s budget and more importantly regardless of what package you end up going for it is value for money. The food was delicious and it catered to everyone’s tastes including a pregnant guest, halal, vegan and lactose intolerant and was the talking point for our guests. The venue itself is stunning! Lots of exposed brick, they had recently redecorated before our wedding and the reception room that doubled up as the dance floor was styled simply but made a statement and the outdoor covered patio area was a welcome addition. The team understood our vision from the get go and they completely nailed it, all of our guests couldn’t believe it was here! I honestly can’t recommend it enough if you’re wanting a small and intimate wedding venue but still with all the class. I would say to future couples even if you think this wouldn’t be your venue please please do have a proper look because it will change your mind, I had come across this venue multiple times over the course of a year and decided to take a leap of faith and give it a chance and we’re so happy we did."
V30,The Hackney,"We can’t recommend the Hackney highly enough. They made the whole process so easy and they offer so much in-house which we took advantage of. The food was especially great - our guests were amazed “best food I’ve ever had at a wedding” and the team took great care of us during the planning stages.

They offer a very customisable service with scalable pricing. If you’re having a fairly small wedding (under 60) then you must check out The Hackney.

We had such a perfect day and we owe so much of that to the fabulous venue. Beautiful space, so professionally run."
V30,The Hackney,"We had such a brilliant experience working with the team at The Hackney. We were regularly in touch throughout the planning process and the use of the shared spreadsheet was especially handy for keeping everyone informed.
We had to postpone our wedding two days before as we were both sick with COVID, and the team were just fantastic. They waited for us to recover and then we started to talk through options again. We were able to rebook just six months after our original date, and the team were accomodating and understanding throughout the process.
The day itself was perfect. Lots of our guests commented on the quality and quantity of the food and Hugo was great at keeping everything to time. We wish we could do it all again."
V30,The Hackney,"We had our wedding reception here and wow was it amazing. Hugo, Erika and the whole team were amazing. Every single guest commented on how delicious and plentiful the food was. The staff were amazing nothing was too much to ask and all so happy.
The venue itself was decorated amazingly, given we left our wedding stationary etc up to the venue it exceeded our expectations. I was concerned about the allowed decibel level for Dj / entertainment but it was plenty loud enough. I wish I could relive the day again, if you’re thinking about booking The Hackney do it! You will not regret!"
V30,The Hackney,"We held our wedding reception at The Hackney in July and it was truly the best experience. We opted for a standing reception for our 65 guests, serving food bowl-style for a more relaxed, less formal feel. The food was absolutely delicious and there was lots of it - it just kept coming! Our guests are still raving about how good the food was months later! Lots of good drinks options too - we especially like the cocktails here!

The staff on the night were so friendly, welcoming and were amazing with our children guests too!

The Hackney is such an aesthetic venue with exposed brick walls and existing foliage which we loved, so we kept additional decorations to a minimum. We dropped our decorations to The Hackney the day before and picked them up the day after, which was super easy! We hadn’t given them too much direction with where we wanted everything placed but when we turned up to the venue on the day it was truly perfect! The staff know exactly what they’re doing and had decorated it beautifully! The outdoor seating area is a great feature too (especially for our two greyhounds who chilled out there for the majority of the reception!)

We opted for a simple Spotify playlist for our music and their sound system was good.

The wedding planning process was super easy from start to finish, with continued support and check-ins from Hugo, from the moment we booked, to the day itself! We really enjoyed the menu tasting experience earlier in the year too, which is a great touch in the build up to the big day! The planning spreadsheet was easy to use and made us feel content and relaxed, knowing that everything was under control.

Overall, we would highly recommend The Hackney to anyone looking for an affordable, dog-friendly, wedding reception venue with a laidback vibe, delicious food and lovely friendly staff! We look forward to coming back every year to celebrate our anniversary, with an espresso martini!"
V30,The Hackney,"We hosted our wedding reception with the team at the hackney in May 2023. The planning experience was straight forward and easy to book. The availability for the venue is on the website so easy to see when they have and get it booked. We went with the 5 canapés, bowl food menu, and drinks on arrival with wine through the event. The staff were brilliant and food delicious.

We loved the vibe of the venue as we wanted a bit more of a casual event, with a relaxed feel and we were able to host our 85 guests with no issues (although limited to standing event at this size, there is enough scattered seating for anyone to sit when they wanted).

In terms of decorating, we didn't feel the need to add any extra flowers as the venue was already so made up with plants and other decorations.

We did add the photo box which I highly recommend, was great fun for our friends and family and came with a memory book. People were shy at first but really got into it. We also used the recommended baker who provided a delicious cake.

Final area to mention - pricing. Wedding venues can be really expensive and daunting before you even start paying for any food or drink. Something that really attracted us to this venue was the low spacing cost and the minimum spend with it. It meant that we were able to completely customise the experience and see where the money we were spending was going. There are many different options and packages to go with, so it's up to you.

Only thing that wasn't offered was any tasting of the food beforehand which we would've liked to have done but none the less, the food was delicious so it wasn't really needed!

To finish, we loved every moment of it and hope that many others get to experience the same. Thank you very much team at the hackney!"
V30,The Hackney,"We had our reception in July. The venue was cosy and comfortably fit 30 people without feeling too crowded or too empty (we were worried it might be too empty). We managed to fit a band in, arranged mini-golf in the venue after dinner, and customize the cocktail menu with custom recipe (that we provided before hand).

One of the biggest highlights was the food. The crispy roast pork got so many complements and indeed it was tasty. But really, all the dishes were amazing (we had a tasting session prior), it was hard to choose, but the taste of each dish was still top notch on the day itself too. I heard that the supper snacks we ordered were great too but alas, I was too busy and they were snapped up instantly!

Some other details:
* We were allowed to use the small room downstairs as a private space to put our stuff. Very handy to not mess up items.
* We went with a bar tab and kept increasing the budget each time till the end of the night instead of the all-you-can-drink. From our rough calculations, it worked out about the same going for all-you-can-drink. Of course, certain folk were heavy weights and more than made it up will be different for each crowd.
* Lighting for photos came out excellent (combination of photographer and venue lighting).
* You can adjust air conditioning to suit the weather (we had ours on the warm side due to older folk not dealing with cold too well).
* Outdoor space was a pleasant change in atmosphere for those who wanted some fresh air.

What about the review from the Bride? Bride approved this review."
V30,The Hackney,"The day was fabulous - Hugo was brilliant and flexible with what we were after. The tasting day before was such a great idea and the whole experience and guidance given made planning a wedding in c.5 months so much easier. We had vegans, last minute drop outs, ridiculously hot weather, about 3 different spotify playlists, a string quartet, florists arriving in the morning and a cake that arrived the day before - the team took it all in their stride and it seemed like a breeze. Loved it all and we've had such good feedback from guests. A fabulous whirlwind.

Two very minor points for feedback - we maxed out the guest numbers (the team did advise us against it but were very accommodating despite us also throwing musicians into the mix) and it was a little too crowded pre-lunch on such a hot day. We also put some speeches in between courses (again, we were recommended against it) and that may have been a slight mistake for the dessert timings, as the tasting day was 10/10. But, it was a perfect day in a stunning venue. Loved it - thank you guys."
V30,The Hackney,"Jon and the team were absolute superstars, hosting the perfect wedding day for us. The space is beautiful, the decor is modern and perfect. They were so accommodating for any request or question we had which we really appreciated. Guests commented on how great the cocktails were! The day ran so smoothly and we had a fantastic time."
V30,The Hackney,"From the initial phonecall to the warm welcome we got when we first visited The Hackney, we knew we were in safe hands and that we’d made the perfect choice. The venue offers the most beautiful interiors - the perfect mix of cosy, intimate and modern industrial - exactly what we were looking for!

Our entire experience with The Hackney was an absolute dream -we loved the mega organised approach to planning. Something that could have been incredibly intimidating was made so straightforward with the amazing support of Hugo the General Manager who embraced all our weird and wonderful suggestions and gave expert advice on what we could do to make things even better. We left every meeting buzzing with ideas and even more excited to welcome our closest friends and family to the big day.

The quality of the food and drinks is impeccable - every single one of our guests (even the fussiest!) has commented on how much they loved it. We absolutely loved the menu tasting, even though it made the decision even harder as everything was amazing. What makes it even better for us is living close by and being able to pop into our wedding venue for a coffee or a cocktail!

I couldn't recommend The Hackney enough - I just wish we could go back and do it all again!"
V31,PYRÁ,"We held our wedding reception at Pyra. We booked the entire venue, with the upstairs loft serving as a dance floor with bar and downstairs having tables and seating for guests.  Canapes were served upstairs and a buffet dinner was served downstairs.  We lucked out with great April weather, so guests were also able to enjoy Pyra’s patio and additional space on Lonsdale Road. We were very happy with our decision to have our reception at Pyra, and many of our guests commented on how lovely the space was, how nice the staff were, and how delicious the food was.
 
The venue:
The space is gorgeous with lots of natural light upstairs.  Guests arrived at 4pm but we had the venue for the entire day, and Pyra gave our florist access earlier to set up beautiful flower arrangements and candles - it looked stunning.  Pyra set up our welcome sign and card box too. The venue also accepted delivery of our cake on the morning of the wedding which was a huge help, set it up very nicely upstairs, and cut it for us after the formal “cake cutting” shots.  We were able to coordinate with Pyra ahead of time to arrange the space how we wanted, such as how many tables we wanted downstairs and the set-up of the loft upstairs.  They even had a microphone ready for us upstairs so we could say a few words to our guests before our cake cutting. Perfect! For the evening dancing, we were able to set the disco lighting to our colour scheme, which worked really well with candles and foliage (latter 2 provided by our florist).
 
The food:
The buffet dinner was fantastic.  Pyra gave us multiple menu items to choose from and we were able to fix a nice menu that took into account guests’ dietary restrictions.  We initially booked the venue when it had a different chef and menu.  We came in a few months before our wedding to try the new menu – our dinner was delicious then and there was no dip in quality for the buffet-style served at our reception. Fionn worked with us how to plan best - because we wanted a relaxed style with a dance floor upstairs, we ended up feeding our 80 guests in two sittings downstairs, which worked perfectly. The upstairs space can seat 60 people, which didn’t work for how we planned our event, but does look really nice in photos. The late night food served around 10pm also went down very well.
 
The staff:
The staff, including the bartenders and waiters, were hardworking, friendly and very nice to guests.  Enough staff were around that guests never had to wait long for drinks.  Members of staff cut our cake for us and also boxed up the late night food for guests to bring home.  Fionn, the day-of coordinator, was on-site for our entire reception and was very helpful, even helping coordinate our midnight bus arrival.
 
Responsiveness:
Overall we were happy with the responsiveness of the venue.  It took a little while to nail down the final details of the food menu and drinks menu/bar tab but we were ultimately very happy with the result.  As the venue hosts more weddings/ larger-scale events we’d expect this will improve.

Overall:
We highly recommend Pyra for a wedding reception. We had 80 guests in total, which worked very well for the canapes/cocktail hour upstairs (4-6pm), sit-down buffet downstairs (6-8pm, split into two seatings) and dancing upstairs (8pm-midnight).  The upstairs loft was able to fit all 80 guests plus a four-piece band.  Lonsdale Road is also a charming street that provided great photo opportunities.  We looked into several other venues, and came away happy with Pyra's quote – we were able to book the venue, food (including canapes, dinner and late night food) and a generous bar tab for roughly the amount some other London venues were charging for just their space (no food or drink included). We and our guests had a fantastic time. Thanks so much to Fionn and the Pyra team :)"
V31,PYRÁ,"We had our wedding celebration at Lula. We booked the loft and restaurant for this.

Positives:
The venue is beautiful and needs minimal decoration.
The food was amazing; the chef is truly professional and everyone loved it.
They redecorated the restaurant section and added a set of couches to make it a lounge, which was beautiful.
The staff was very hardworking, professional, and lovely.

They provided us with a lounge, a wedding breakfast space and a dance floor.

Flexibility with Cake:
The bakery was scheduled to deliver and set up the cake at 16:45, but they delivered it at 09:45 instead. The Lula team handled the situation professionally by storing the cake and setting it up at the correct time. They presented the cake beautifully and assisted in cutting it into nice pieces. It could not have been more perfect.


The list of available drinks was huge, and they were happy to make custom drinks and bring in different juices if requested in advance. The event manager tried to accommodate every wish we had, and on the day we could not have hoped for more. Most of our guests said it was one of the best weddings and most beautiful venues they had ever been to.

Negatives:
Food tasting for the wedding menu was not included, which we had assumed would be, but it was given at a 50% discount. We had to sort out the floral decoration last minute, as they had initially suggested they would arrange it for us after providing a budget, but later said we needed to find our own. At times, they were a bit slow to respond, which made us anxious, but after communicating with them, this was resolved, and communication was very swift.

In conclusion:
Lula gave us the most beautiful wedding we could have dreamt of. We highly recommend them. The venue, the food, the service were amazing, and we could not have hoped for more."
V32,Sandon Manor,"We had such a special wedding at Sandon Manor, the team made every effort to make our day so so special and we will be forever grateful for that. A dream team! The day ran so smoothly and they worked so hard. The venue is unique with lots of different spaces which unfold throughout the day, which was perfect as our wedding fell on a wet and windy autumnal day. We would highly recommend Sandon Manor!"
V32,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor provided the perfect venue for our wedding. From the initial conversations and meetings with the team, we knew we were in safe hands and had made the right choice. They kept us informed with any events, made information a bit payments clear and reassured us with any query we had.
The accommodation was exceptional and fitted our requirements perfectly, with high quality finishing touches throughout to ensure our stay was as comfortable as possible.
The wedding venue was incredible! Our ceremony took place in the gorgeously modern barn with stunning draping and greenery. Following on, we had a blissful drinks reception which was on the expertly manicured lawn (with mini golf!) and sun-trap of a courtyard. We then moved onto our wedding breakfast which was held in the main barn, seating all of our guests comfortably with space for decor and extra details. Following from dinner, the part started and the club room came to life! This was absolutely the talking point of the day and our guests raved about how incredible it was! It managed to create a club-like atmosphere, whilst maintaining the vibe, albeit at a reduced volume, in the rest of the barn. The layout of the venue was important to us, as it ensured our guests never strayed too far, to keep the momentum of the day.
The team at Sandon worked superbly with all of vendors which ensured the day ran smoothly from set up to clearing. All of our vendors commented on how much they too loved working there.
The venue, the aesthetics, the staff, everything was perfect! We would absolutely recommend to anyone getting married."
V32,Sandon Manor,"We cannot recommend Sandon Manor enough. From the quality of the service, the helpfulness and friendliness of the team, the beautiful accommodation and the most amazing venue which all or guests loved partying the night away in. To make it even more special the Manor is in amazing grounds in beautiful countryside and nature reserves.
Sandon Manor made our dream come true."
V32,Sandon Manor,"I couldn't recommend Sandon Manor highly enough - from our first enquiry to our Wedding, nothing was too much trouble. The team are so friendly and easy to communicate with, very approachable and responsive. They respond to any questions immediately and having the day before to set up with Tom was fantastic. Styaying in the Manor House and Dovecote was the icing on the cake as to be with friends and family the night before and the day after was so fabulous. On the day Tom and the team were absolutely fantastic and couldn't have done more to make our special day. We couldn't have dreamt of anywhere more perfect than Sandon Manor - a huge thank you to all the staff."
V32,Sandon Manor,"If you are considering Sandon Manor for your wedding venue, I beg you: scratch it off your list now. Yes, the house and grounds are beautiful, but the people behind it are absolutely awful. They ruined our wedding experience.

I will get straight to it. Sandon Manor has a very strict policy on guests leaving the site by 11:30pm (and no one is allowed back to the Manor unless they’re official guests staying overnight). We had lots of international guests at our wedding. Many hadn’t seen each other in years and would be jetlagged - we thought they may be keen to continue chatting after 11:30pm. With this in mind, we made a booking with Sandon Village Hall via our contacts at the church (where we were attending services and later married). They granted us access to the village hall until 1am as a contingency spill over space.

We mentioned this in passing during our online meeting with one of the Sandon Manor team a month before our wedding. Within hours, I received a voicemail from the lady in charge of Village Hall bookings saying (quote) “someone at Sandon Manor is trying to throw a spanner into the works for you”. It soon transpired that they had raised an official complaint to the parish council and pressurised the village hall team into cancelling our booking. To be clear, Sandon village Hall and Sandon Manor are entirely separate entities – there is no crossover between them whatsoever, as the owner of Sandon Manor later acknowledged.

It gets worse. Gob smacked, we asked Kate – the owner of Sandon Manor – for a call to find out what was going on. She was abhorrent, trying to justify her meddling as a necessary measure to protect her wedding license (side note: with Sandon Manor it is always about the money – once your deposit is paid they care nothing for your ‘special day’; you are just another cash cow). Did she apologise for stabbing us, her clients, in the back? No, she did not. She could not even fathom how hurt we were by being completely bypassed in the communication chain and how deceitful and disrespectful this was. My husband and I were quite literally left speechless. We’ve never experienced this sort of treatment from anyone, let alone our wedding venue - to whom we were paying many thousands of pounds. Dealing with this stress in the final month of wedding prep really took its toll on us and soured things. We no longer looked forward to our day, rather dreaded what Sandon Manor might do next.

Aside from this major incident, there were many other occasions when Sandon Manor were unhelpful and unfeeling in their interactions with us:

- We enquired if it would be possible to arrange a large pizza takeaway order instead of using Sandon Manor’s caterer for our late night food. One of the team explained on a call that this wasn’t contractually possible; we acknowledged this. We then received an email saying ‘If you are unable to follow this or any other of our T&C's we would be happy to cancel your booking.’ This was less than a month before our wedding.
- We had a harpist perform in the church. We were told she wasn’t allowed to play during our drinks reception in the grounds due to potential noise complaints (an acoustic harp at 2pm in the afternoon). No other music was permitted outside the house.
- Sandon Manor is an incredibly expensive (in hindsight, grossly overpriced) venue. But we were also hit with hidden fees when booking their accommodation option - an extra £425 ‘cleaning fee’ was added to our bill.
- At the time of booking, Sandon was running a promotion waivering the £700 fee for hiring their ceremony space. As we were marrying at the church, we asked if it would please be possible to put this towards other elements of our day i.e. using their festoon string of lights in the barn (for which they charge £450). They refused.
- We were unsure about booking the 1-bed Dovecote on the grounds as - at £499 for the weekend - it was a considerable expense. While we were deciding Sandon Manor rented it out on Air BnB (to one of our guests, which made for a very awkward conversation).

To summarise, you only get one wedding day. Kate and her team absolutely ruined ours. There are so many other lovely venues in north Hertfordshire run by decent, humane people. Please prioritise your happiness and choose wisely. I wish we had."
V32,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor is a stunning wedding venue with a great team behind it. The exclusive use of the manor for the weekend was a highlight, allowing us to relax with friends and family in the lead up to and after the big day. The Sandon team were brilliant, guiding us through the planning process and ensuring everything ran smoothly on the day. We couldn't have asked for a better place and team to help us celebrate our big day."
V32,Sandon Manor,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our special day. Holly, Tom and the rest of the brilliant team made us feel welcome from day one. Special mention to Tom for making the day run so seamlessly, so professional and accommodating of all our needs.

The venue itself is stunning, located in the beautiful Hertfordshire countryside. The Manor House makes for a tremendous location to prepare, and the Dovecote suite is a nice touch: a great addition for the groom to spend the last night. We loved the small details of the characteristic main venue, with the botanical feel to the bar a great backdrop to the barn.

It’s a shame we can’t stay every week!

Dan & Suzanne"
V32,Sandon Manor,"To Holly, Louise, Tom & Kate, wow, what can we say but the biggest thank you for the best day of our lives! When we viewed the beautiful venue over two years ago we just knew instantly Sandon Manor was the one, not just because it’s stunning, but you guys are amazing! Thank you for making all our wedding dreams come true. Forever grateful and can’t wait to return to reminisce. Lots of love, the new Mr & Mrs Jakes xxx"
V32,Sandon Manor,"From the moment we visited Sandon Manor we knew this would be our wedding venue for 9 September 2023. Seeing the spectacular finish of the house carry through to the completed venue just shows the high level of attention to detail this venue had to offer.

Holly, Tom and the rest of the team filled us with confidence right from our first interactions, annd went above and beyond on the wedding weekend itself to facilitate us, our suppliers and guests. The main house, dovecote, annex and extensive grounds were a wonderful way to have close family stay with us on site, and so handy to be able to all get ready nearby the morning of.

Thank you for making our wedding weekend a truly memorable occasion, for us and our families. We all look back on this day with the happiest, sunniest memories and Sandon Manor will always have a very special place in our hearts."
V32,Sandon Manor,"We had the most amazing wedding weekend at Sandon Manor.

The venue itself is the perfect backdrop for a wedding, our photos looked amazing from every single angle. There were so many spaces to make use of throughout the day which helped things to run incredibly smoothly and meant we didn’t need to have a ‘turnaround’ during the evening. The spaces really wowed our guests and created such a lovely atmosphere. Including the ‘club room’ dance floor that had our guests dancing until the very last song!

We stayed at the Manor House for the weekend, extending our wedding into a perfect weekend retreat. The house itself is beautiful, with lots of different areas for everyone to relax, and the perfect peaceful location to chill the night before the big day!

From our first viewing to checking out the day after our wedding, the Sandon staff were attentive, friendly and helped us feel relaxed and looked after throughout an otherwise overwhelming process. We’d highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for a beautiful, peaceful and unique wedding venue!"
V33,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Thank you so much to the entire team for making our wedding so special! Thanks to Donique, MJ, Mo, Harry and everyone else for helping us organise our day and for their professional but friendly attitude. Merchant Taylors is such a beautiful venue and offers a brilliant layout and different spaces to make the day so special!"
V33,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you all so very much for such an amazing wedding on Saturday. You all worked tirelessly to make it so special. Everything was truly wonderful and you all did me proud! Both Hugh and I couldn’t have asked for anything more in terms of being so well looked after. Our guests were so impressed and have given us so many compliments on a brilliantly well run event. Thank you all again for playing a brilliant part in our truly wonderful day of which we loved every minute
V33,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you so much for the most wonderful wedding reception at the end of April. We had the perfect day and our guests all commented on how well looked after they has been. Thank you again for all your hard work!
V33,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"We know this is very late (we have no excuse), but we wanted to say thank you for everything you and the team at Merchant Taylor's did for us on our wedding day. All the guests have since told us how much they loved the venue, food and service. Fingers crossed you get a few couples getting in touch! Again, Thank You for everything!"
V33,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"My brother and I attended the wedding today, as Florist's for the wedding party.
We were treated fantastically well by ALL the staff that we met, nothing was too much trouble and they made our task a COMPLETE pleasure.
If this is how they treat the actual wedding party then you will have a unforgettable time. Many thanks to all the staff for helping us to do our job with ease ."
V33,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Zara,

Can we thank you and your team at Merchant Taylor’s Hall for all your hard work in making Caroline and Neil’s recent wedding so very special. You, in particular, were able to deal with every question and request in a really professional manner.

Merchant Taylors’ Hall is part of the rich panoply of history and tradition, which makes this great City. All of our guests, and in particular those from abroad, were totally spell bound by the atmosphere, the food and service.

James was superb in organising the whole operation. To turn the Great Hall from a wedding ceremony hall to a banqueting suite for 110 guests, including flowers, place settings and dance floor in ninety minutes was truly remarkable.

The food and wine was of an amazing standard, we know that Merchant Taylors’ Hall has a reputation for presenting some of the finest dining in the City of London. You certainly surpassed all expectations.

We have many wonderful memories of the 10th September 2016, but it is best summed up by our daughter Caroline, “Can we do it all over again?”."
V34,Garden Museum,I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate everything that you did to make our party such a success last Friday. It was brilliant being outside on such a lovely everning. Everyone was very impressed with the venue.
V34,Garden Museum,"Thank you for all your help, advice and on-the-day support, it really made our wedding very special and it certianly went off without a hitch! The Museum looked amazing and the garden was perfect, especially as the sunshine adn the guests wanted to make the most of the beautiful surroundings."
V35,Clearwell Castle,"Can’t tell you how wonderful the team were at Clearwell. Our wedding coordinator Phaedra was exceptional. Attention to detail and everyone of the team from front of house, waiting staff, groundsmen and the DJ made our day absolutely everything we dreamed of and unique to us.

Can’t recommend highly enough and cost was outstanding value for money.

So many our guest commented on the quality of the food and that it was the best wedding they had been too! The children loved the magic of the castle and opportunity to get outside and see the grounds.

The grooms family had a fabulous time staying in the cottages the night before and our guests at both the Castle & the Wyndham had a fabulous stay on the night of the wedding.

Wish we could do it all again!"
V35,Clearwell Castle,We had our wedding at Clearwell in June and we couldn’t recommend it highly enough. From start to finish everything was perfect and they went above and beyond to ensure we had an amazing day. I’d not hesitate in recommending them to any couples. Just a gorgeous place with staff that really care in making your day all that you hope it will be.
V35,Clearwell Castle,"From the moment we first visited Clearwell, we knew this was the venue for us. From the moment we started planning to the final touches on the day, all the staff were fantastic. Ann, our wedding coordinator, was a delight to work with throughout. Nothing was too much trouble and she kept us updated throughout. The day was tailored exactly to our needs and when we arrived at the venue on the day they had prepared everything perfectly.

We did the night before package which included rooms and food the evening before. We were supplied with so much food no one went hungry. The rooms in the Wyndham and the Castle are fantastically appointed.

The venue itself is gorgeous. The cellar bar downstairs adds a whole different dimension to the occasion where you can really let your hair down.

This was an absolute dream come true venue for us. We loved every single minute."
V35,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot fault this venue at all. We initially had to change our wedding date because of lockdown and they were so supportive and empathetic.
Ann, our coordinator, is quite possibly the loveliest person on the planet. She was always happy to answer any questions and it never felt like we were being a nuisances or asking a silly question.
On the morning of the wedding she was a lovely calm presence and the whole day just ran like clockwork.
The food was out of this world with many guests saying it was the best food they’d had at a wedding and one person actually thought we’d hired a Michellin Chef!
The venue is so so beautiful with plenty of space. The downstairs cellar was a great place to party the night away, it was like an exclusive nightclub. There were lots of quieter rooms for people who wanted some peace.
The DJ was brilliant, we forgot to give a list of songs we liked but he did a great job of guessing what we liked ( he must’ve looked at our age and figured nineties dance music was our era. And he was bang on the money)
I do not have a single complaint about this venue"
V35,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot speak highly enough about Clearwell Castle as a wedding venue. The venue itself is absolutely stunning. It rained on our wedding day but the indoor space was so vast and beautiful that ourselves and our guests still had the most amazing time! Our wedding co-ordinator, Phaedra, was absolutely incredible, both before and during the wedding. She was always so professional, replied to all of my emails (there were many) and answered all queries efficiently. On the day, we genuinely could not have managed without her. The day flowed so well with her guidance and it really helped me as the Bride as I felt I didn't need to worry about anything! All the other staff at Clearwell and at the Wyndham hotel were also so wonderful! Everyone worked so hard and every member of staff was so kind to us; it just made our day incredibly special and we are so appreciative to them all. The food was great, service very quick and all the guests really enjoyed it! We had so many compliments about the staff and venue! I honestly could not recommend Clearwell castle more as a wedding venue!"
V35,Clearwell Castle,"Our wedding on 10/11/23 was just the absolute perfect day from start to finish. Our wedding planner manager, Hannah, was incredible, not just on the day but throughout the whole planning process. She ensured everything ran smoothly on the day, sparing no details ensuring everything was just perfect and to time but without being stressful. She was very accommodating with the planning meetings working around both mine and my now Husband's shift patterns.
We both stayed the night before our wedding and the night of the wedding with many of our guests travelling a distance so also staying in the Wyndham which was very convenient. Staying in Keepers cottage with the Bridesmaids the night before added to the experience with the added feature of the hot tub, the groomsmen were very jealous. The beds were very comfortable and everyone was excited to stay in a castle.
On the day of the wedding, the staff were very accommodating moving the bridal party along to the bridal suite to finish preparations earlier than originally planned. The breakfast provided was the perfect amount for a busy morning getting ready. Everything, including the gardens, were immaculately kept adding to the WOW factor of getting married in a Castle.
The canapes served and welcome drinks were well received by the guests and ourselves whilst we had photographers prior to the wedding breakfast. The food was phenomenal and great portions and I was stuffed after. The staff were very accommodating for us with a lot of people with allergies, dislikes of mushrooms so adapting the menu for these individual people. We were even able to swap out a few bottles of wine included in our package for cocktails as us as the Bride and Groom did not drink wine.
As soon as we walked in the venue the first time, we knew it was the place we wanted to get married. Everytime we went back to view the venue again I fell more and more in love. For anyone thinking about viewing or even booking this incredible venue I would say do it! We will be going back for events in the future to relive the best day of our lives."
V35,Clearwell Castle,"We got married at Clearwell castle April 2023. What can I say it's the most perfect venue and we had the most amazing day. The organisation was amazing and the staff were great on the day and even leading up to the big day. Phaedra was our wedding planner and communication with her was great throughout and on our wedding day she ensured that it all ran smoothly. I cannot recommend Clearwell castle and their staff enough. Thank you again for helping us have our dream wedding.
Kind regards

Vanessa & David x"
V35,Clearwell Castle,"We had the most amazing wedding day on the 24th of November 2023, the whole day ran so smoothly and all our guests absolutely loved the venue. The food was amazing and our guests loved the fish and chip buffet in the evening! The whole progress of planning the wedding was so straight forward and Phedera was a great wedding manager."
V35,Clearwell Castle,"Clearwell Castle exceeded all our expectations for our wedding day. The moment we stepped onto the grounds, we were captivated by its timeless charm. The staff, especially Hannah, went above and beyond to make every detail perfect, ensuring a seamless and stress-free experience. The Ball Room, where we exchanged our vows, felt like something out of a storybook. The surrounding gardens provided a stunning backdrop for photos and added to the overall enchantment of the day. Our guests were equally impressed, and many commented on the unique and romantic atmosphere. Choosing Clearwell Castle was the best decision we made for our special day; it truly felt like a fairy-tale come to life."
V35,Clearwell Castle,"We had the perfect wedding at Clearwell Castle, their team were superb in providing planning assistance from the point of our booking, guidance on all aspects of our wedding choices from registrars and suppliers, and coordination on the day of the wedding to make sure it flowed seamlessly. It was a beautiful day, and we couldn't be happier with our choice of Wedding location."
V36,Inner Temple,We got married here in 2023. Everything was perfect and the team made sure the day/food etc was just as we wanted it. Particular thanks to Priya and Eva (Pegasus) for their hard work making our wedding day and lead up so special.
V37,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"I got married at Dodford Manor in February this year. A great time was had by all and I will be recommending the venue to any friends planning weddings.

The weather was bad on the day so we didn’t get to use the outside area very much, but it didn’t matter as the inside is so lovely.

Sky was really helpful and put me at ease on the day. Questions in the lead up and on the day were answered quickly and I was made to feel like the only bride in the world!"
V37,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford was the first venue we looked at shortly after we got engaged. The staff were friendly and relaxed when we had a tour, I knew it was the place for us! I think Lydia telling my now husband that we couldn’t have fireworks due to the animals nearby but we could have a fire performer outside, sold the deal for us! I got an amazing fire performer as a surprise for my husband and the guests after we had sparklers, and it just completed an amazing day!
We heard such positive things Dodford about how professional and smooth running weddings have been from our suppliers, and you guys didn’t disappoint. You handled the day so well, we didn’t worry about a thing and just enjoyed ourselves the whole day.
We honestly had so many lovely messages and conversations after our wedding about how the venue was amazing, everything and everyone was catered for, from my 88 year old Nan, to young children who could play and enjoy the outdoors with a scoop of amazing ice cream. We honestly couldn’t have asked for a better day, we would do it again in a heartbeat if we could! Thank you for making the day so seamless! We are eternally grateful to everyone at Dodford for making our dreams come true becoming Mr and Mrs Price!"
V37,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford Manor what an incredible venue, from initial enquiry to booking, Dodford and the staff were so accommodating and well organised. Nothing was ever too much trouble, even if emails were being sent at 11pm. The day itself, wow it was absolutely incredible, as our wedding was on a budget and due to small numbers Dodford were amazing at setting out our decorations, everything was absolutely perfect and a special shout out to Kayleigh who was amazing on our wedding day. She kept us on time, always checking we were okay and just such a lovely person and really made our day perfect. Would highly recommend a Dodford to any couple due to be married they make the planning and the day an absolute dream and we want to relive it over again."
V37,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"It goes without saying that Dodford is a fab venue.... stunning set up, well maintained, clean, perfect grounds etc... but the best thing about Dodford is the team! I had super high expectations of any wedding venue I booked as I used to run a wedding venue myself (potential nightmare client 😂).... from the 1st viewing the team were fantastic. Relaxed, stress free, organised, professional, knowledgeable, flexible but mostly importantly friendly which gave me complete confidence in them delivering my perfect day.
In the run up to the big day the team are super responsive on email and phone We didn't meet our Event Manager, Lydia, until the day but I was always confident that they work as a whole team and therefore having 1 point of contact was not necessary at all.
In the day Lydia was amazing! Still relaxed and professional and the whole day ran so smoothly. Every requirement was perfect, on time, delivered exceptionally.
We had the best day, thank you to the whole team (especially Lydia!)
Vic & Tony

V37,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We honestly can’t say thank you enough for how amazing Dodford Manor Barn was, along with all the incredible staff who helped make our day truly unforgettable.

From the moment we visited, we fell in love with the beautiful landscapes, open-plan barns, and stunning large windows that flooded the space with natural light. The venue package was one of the best we saw during our search—it felt like everything we could possibly need was covered.

The team at Dodford Manor Barn were incredibly friendly and supportive throughout the entire planning process. Communication was open and consistent, which made everything feel so much more manageable and stress-free. We were even able to find all of our wonderful vendors through Dodford Manor Barn, which was a huge bonus!

As a bride who suffers from anxiety, I was unwell on the morning of the wedding. But I have to give special thanks to Kayleigh and our vendors, who were absolutely amazing and supported me through every step—they helped me feel calm, cared for, and ready to enjoy the day.

Our guests couldn’t stop talking about how stunning the venue was and how lovely the food turned out. We were also lucky enough to have sunshine all day, topped off with a beautiful sunset in the evening—it truly felt magical.

Thank you again, Dodford Manor Barn, for being such a perfect place to start our next chapter.

With love,
Carter & Emmie (24.03.2025) x"
V37,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"From the moment we booked our wedding at Dodford Manor, we knew we were in good hands—but nothing could have prepared us for just how extraordinary the experience would be. Every single detail was handled with such precision, care, and genuine warmth that it truly felt like a dream come to life.

The venue itself is breathtaking, but what made our day unforgettable was the impeccable service. The entire team operated like a well-oiled machine, making sure everything ran smoothly while keeping the atmosphere joyful and stress-free. Their attention to detail was second to none—no request was too big or too small.

We want to give a heartfelt, special shoutout to *Lydia*, our incredible Wedding Manager. From our first meeting to the final dance, she was nothing short of amazing. Lydia went above and beyond at every turn—anticipating needs before we even voiced them, coordinating flawlessly with suppliers, and offering support with a calming confidence that put us completely at ease, (apart from making me cry the second I saw her! 😂). Her passion for what she does shone through in every interaction, and our day would not have been the same without her.

Thanks to this amazing venue and its phenomenal team (especially Lydia!), we were able to truly enjoy every moment of our wedding, knowing everything was in the best possible hands. If you're considering this venue for your big day—don’t hesitate. It’s everything you hope for, and more.

We want to do it over and over!
A day we will NEVER forget!!

Thank you again and all our Love,
Mr & Mr Pargeter-Prince
Rowan & Karl xx"
V37,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We booked Dodford Manor in Feb 2024 after we viewed the space, for our wedding in March 2025. It was the only venue we viewed, but instantly fell in love with the character and variety of spaces the venue had to offer. The free corkage also really appealed to us as a great way for us to bring our own drinks at a good cost.

From start to end, the team were amazing, helping us with the planning of the day and making sure we had a great array of suppliers we could work with. The live band was a huge part of our day, and Dodford have a great mixture of acts on their supplier list.

On the day of the wedding, the groomsmen arrived at the venue to help with set up to see that our amazing event manager, Kayleigh had every single aspect of the day in hand and sorted. She sorted all table settings, decor, stationary - Everything!! Nothing was too much to ask of her and the Dodford team. The day ran impeccably well, with everything being on time and everything we asked for being sorted. Our drinks were served chilled, on time and were always around. It’s easy for venues who offer free corkage to try and limit you drinking your own drink - Not here!! There was constantly beers being topped up, wine bottles replaced and aperol spritz being taken round. Cannot fault them!

The team packed all of our bits away and ready for us to collect the next morning. We are very aware Dodford is a busy venue and wanted to make sure we wasn’t just “another wedding” but at no point was that the case. We felt like we were the one and only wedding and genuinely could not ask for more!

Thank you so so much for everything, Highly recommended!!"
V37,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We got married her a month ago today and had the most amazing day with them. Jess, Jack and the team made sure that everything ran smoothly and that they were doing everything they could for us on the day. We would 100% recommend them for anyone wishing to marry in such a beautiful setting."
V37,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We had been apprehensive booking Dodford for our reception that it was so popular in Northamptonshire that our wedding could end up looking the same as a lot of others we knew of, as we're local - but that was a ridiculous thing to worry about! The level of flexibility/customisation you get with Dodford is unmatched in our opinion; as it's such a beautiful venue to start with, you don't have to work hard to make it look good before adding in your personality as a couple!

The whole process from enquiries to final planning and the execution on the day were great. We did have a slight issue with them not inviting us to a food tasting in enough time before our wedding date (whether they forgot/we were missed off a list we don't know) but when we did raise it they invited us to a tasting at their sister venue instead (it's 2 hours away but we were available to travel thankfully). Every member of staff we encountered in our experience with Dodford were so friendly and make you feel like you are the only couple that matters for them in that moment, which we really appreciated from such a popular/busy venue. Abbie was our Event Manager on the day and provided such an elevated level of service, nothing was too much trouble and she executed our plans/vision to a tee, adding in some extra details that we loved too.

Our wedding was in December 2024, and we only had our reception at Dodford, so the ceremony barn was set up for our drinks reception with plenty of space for guests without it feeling cramped or equally like we were all rattling around in there (we had 75 guests for our reception). They don't have many photos of indoor drinks receptions in their promo so I was a little worried how it would look but the team had it set up beautifully. We also had a brass band on the mezzanine level which was really fun and festive!

What sold Dodford for us was the no daytime corkage, which meant we could really personalise our drinks reception and wedding breakfast drinks without breaking the bank. There was a slight disconnect with how and when we had requested/planned to serve some of the drinks in our planning meeting and what happened on the day, which we think may have been a slight hiccup in communication between Dodford and Jenkinsons (the caterers), but it didn't have a negative impact on our day at all!

Overall, there's a reason this is such a popular venue - it is truly perfect!"
V37,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,Dodford manor is an amazing wedding venue. From the very beginning when we first stepped into the venue to look around we fell in love. We knew we had to have our wedding there. After booking the venue we had amazing contact with the staff from booking our food tasting session. To a general email to see how our wedding planning was going. The planning meeting was well organised and we were able to talk through exactly what we wanted and no want was too big for the team.
V38,Gosfield Hall,"I never imagined my wedding would be somewhere as stunning as Gosfield hall but from the minute we saw this venue we knew it was the one for us and didn't bother viewing anymore venues as we had already made our minds up about having our wedding here! We were absolutely blown away with the natural beauty of Gosfield hall and so booked two years in advance of our wedding day! The professionalism and advice we received from Linda was super helpful and informative on the run up to our wedding as there is soo much to think about! We loved that we could have our day and evening all in one place aswell as the option weather permitting to have our wedding ceremony outside. I'm pleased to say the weather was absolutely perfect on our wedding day and we got to have our fairytale wedding outside! The package we paid for was well worth the money! Our guests were absolutely spoilt on our day and have all said it was the best wedding they've ever been too! It was amazing to have our guests stay over aswell! Jocie our wedding planner was absolutely amazing! She was sooo friendly and super accommodating and went above and beyond on our day to make it absolutely perfect with no hiccups! She even helped dress me on the day as she knew how to do up a corset dress and my mother didn't have a clue lol she made all my wedding details and decorations come to life and done such a stunning job decorating our dream venue aswell as being super supportive towards me my family and guests! The honeymoon suite is the best we've ever seen and completely took ours and our guests breaths away! Mind blowing! The food,venue,grounds,accomodation and night before accomodation were absolutely stunning and we want to thank everyone at Gosfield hall for making our day soo incredible and special and a day we and our guests will never forget! We can't wait to return to Gosfield! Thank you everyone at Gosfield what an amazing place!"
V38,Gosfield Hall,"We had previously experienced Gosfield Hall as a guest before deciding on it for our anniversary.

Our day was beautiful and went according to plan. Our guests all had great feedback about the day.

The only thing we would have changed would have been more diverse menu for the main meals."
V38,Gosfield Hall,"Gosfield hall is a beautiful location for a wedding and their packages cover all the important stuff! We didn’t have to worry about caterers, wedding coordinator or a DJ - all included! Great service, lovely food and everyone really enjoyed the day! Our coordinator Jocie was fab on the day, getting everything organised and fetching anything we needed. Couldn’t have asked for better, she knew the time line and the day flowed really smoothly!"
V38,Gosfield Hall,"We got married at Gosfield Hall and everything about it was perfect from when we arrive to view it, booking, the communication and Faye Carter our wedding Coordinator! If you want the best wedding day with no hassle, Gosfield is your place!!"
V38,Gosfield Hall,"Myself and my Wife have just got married at Gosfield Hall,
Our expensive started when we viewed the venue and we first met Linda sales manager, she welcome us in & made us feel at home, we wasn’t sure how, but she made us feel calm like this was where we was meant to be.
Once we looked around at all the venue has to offer we had already made a decision as this is such a stunning location and instantly new this was what we wanted! It was just right for us.

We did not get made to feel pressured to make any decisions immediately however we did end up booking our big say within the next few days after our visit.

Our next contact was with Ellie our wedding planner, she was very helpful and nothing was ever to much, we enjoyed the food tasting at the venue and was very impressed with the experience, it was out of this world.
Ellie helped us through all of our problems and made sure all of our plans come to life.

Now on our big day, what can I say? The staff were amazing, Ellie couldn’t have done enough every time you wanted to ask a question she was next to us any time we needed something. She was there all the way through the day/ night & even the next morning, Ellie made our day Run seamlessly.
We’ve been to many weddings before but never have we had food as amazing as we did here.
Every guest was amazed at the food quality and commented on how delicious it was!
Just to sum up if you’re thinking about booking your wedding at Gosfield Hall don’t question it just book it. You will be amazed."
V38,Gosfield Hall,"The venue is stunning and was the perfect setting for our winter wedding (so much natural light even in January). Jocie Golbourn was our assigned wedding planning specialist and she is so kind, sweet, patient and professional. All our guests loved the venue but many actually commented on how flawless and seamless the day was organised and rooms decorated and prepared from each section of the wedding and we only have Jocie and venue staff to thank for their meticulous planning and preparations. The food and drinks were delicious. Couldn’t recommend this venue enough- we actually booked the venue on a whim and were SO happy when we visited for an open day. There’s no false advertisements- it’s stunning."
V38,Gosfield Hall,"Everything, from start to finish, was exactly what we wanted and more. The preparation was helped by our wonderful personal manager, Tara, and accommodated each and every one of our requests and needs. The venue is gorgeous, food delicious, and atmosphere felt special. Our friends and family all told us that this was such a spectacular wedding for them that it was the best they've ever been to. We felt completely taken care of, kept us calm and happy throughout the day, and kept all of our suppliers in place and to standard. It felt glamourous and unique. We wish we could relive the day over and over. It really was our dream wedding."
V38,Gosfield Hall,"We got married in Gosfield Hall in May and had the most amazing wedding day that any couple could ask for. The whole experience from the arrival the night before to leaving the day after was seamlessly managed by the team at the venue.
The house and the grounds looked absolutely stunning and Ellie and the team did a brilliant job at keeping the day running smoothly without making anyone feel rushed. Everyone there was immensely friendly and helpful and we really felt that everyone who worked there was invested in making our day feel special.
We fell in love with the venue when we booked it but the whole experience exceeded out expectations so much that we wish we could do it all again!"
V38,Gosfield Hall,"I wanted to take a moment to commend and state our appreciation for Jocie. She truly was phenomenal, approachable and no task was too big.
We had 5 months to plan our wedding and we loved every moment. With us both working in the service industry it was great to have someone who was so switched on and would be an asset to have on any team."
V38,Gosfield Hall,"Having just got married at Gosfield Hall I can honestly say it was the most beautiful venue and the most perfect day. The staff were so attentive and professional. The food was outstanding and the drinks and cocktails were fabulous. They couldn’t do enough to make sure our day was everything we’d dreamt of. I have to say a special thanks to Ellie - one of the wedding coordinators on site - she went above and beyond to help us plan our day and was there from the very moment I woke up delivering fresh pastries for breakfast to the moment she made me a cup of tea to go to bed with. I can’t thank you enough Ellie, you are an absolute credit to Gosfield Hall."
V39,Kingston Estate Totnes,"When I first enquired with Kingston I thought it would be too expensive but we explained what are budget was and when we wanted to get married and they put a quote together that was affordable.
We have just had the most amazing one day wedding which didn't finish until the early hours. We got married in the Long Barn where there are chandeliers running down the middle, it was very romantic. There is this nightclub at Kingston which is very cool which everyone loved. The guests all said the venue was stunning and the food was out of this world.
A few of us stayed the night before and most of our guests stayed the night of the wedding in the cottages and barns. The staff were brilliant and they coordinated the whole day for us. I cant recommend the venue enough."
V39,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had a two day wedding at the Kingston Estate. All our guests were completely blown away by it.
Most of our friends and family had traveled far for the weekend and were not disappointed when then arrived as the cottages and barns are gorgeous. Some even have hot tubs.
Jodie and the Weddings Team organised a welcome party for the first night which was unreal along with providing street style food for everyone around 8.30 pm. At Kingston they have this really cool enormous Yurt and food hut which is used the day before the wedding and for breakfast.
On the wedding day itself we got married in the Walled Garden and there were endless canapes during the drinks reception. We then decided to eat in the Hayloft Barn which has glass windows overlooking all the gardens.
We used the clear span marquee for our reception party and had the craziest cover band before we all went into the nightclub until 3 am. The good thing about Kingston is everything is included they let you use things like cake stands, easels, knifes, speakers, microphones, all furniture at no extra cost, they set everything up for you and then clean up afterwards. We didn]t have to do anything which made everything totally stress free.

Thank you Jodie, Ellie and Charlotte it was insane !!"
V39,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had the most magical wedding at Kingston. From the moment we set foot onto the grounds, we knew it was the perfect place for our special day. It was our first viewing… and nothing else compared for us (we saw a total of 6 venues). What stood out to us the most was the variety of spaces available for each part of the day. The selection of ceremony areas, the beautiful outdoor spots for photos, the yurt for the night before party, and a special one for us… the underground nightclub for the evening! As party lovers, this was a part that sold it for us; there was somewhere for every moment.

One of the things we loved most was the flexibility to personalize every aspect of our wedding. The venue truly felt like a blank canvas that we could transform into our dream setting, but equally, we got away with doing absolutely nothing as it was beautiful all on its own.

But what truly made our experience unforgettable was the incredible staff, led by Jodie. They were not only professional and attentive but also genuinely warm and welcoming. Their support and attention to detail ensured that everything ran smoothly, allowing us to relax and fully enjoy our day.

We're hoping to return and stay in the future, for a special occasion.

It's not just a wedding venue; it's a place that holds a special spot in our hearts as the backdrop to the beginning of our happily ever after 🤍"
V39,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Kingston was perfect. Despite a rainy start, the day was amazing and Jodie was available but subtly in the background allowing the day to be ours."
V39,Kingston Estate Totnes,"After over a two and a half year wait due to Covid, our son and his wife had a wonderful wedding weekend. Jodie from Kingston Estate and her team of staff went above and beyond to ensure the wedding ran smoothly. Every detail was dealt with professionally. The accommodation, venue and food were all excellent and all our guests many from overseas had a wonderful time. The only thing Jodie could not oversee was the weather but even a little rain didn't spoil the celebrations."
V39,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue and staff were brilliant from start to finish. The venue is really multi-functional and caters for rain or shine. The weather was really unpredictable around the time of our wedding but I was a stress free bride knowing they had it in hand. The food supplier was stunning - we had a weekend package which all the guests raved about. That coupled with the unlimited drinks pages made it the perfect venue for us. A Devon treasure that feels like being on a film set - everyone loved it!
V39,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Such a beautiful venue - we loved it so much. The food was incredible and despite having a changeover of wedding planner close to the wedding day, it had no impact on our day what so ever. The venue are calm and professional and loved their approach to communication which was friendly."
V39,Kingston Estate Totnes,Fell in love with the venue on our first visit. We were particularly looking for a venue which could cater us for 3 days and sleep the majority of the the guests. The grounds were well kept especially the walled garden which is where the ceremony took place. The team were a pleasure and made the day truly special.
V39,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Our 3-day wedding celebrations were spent at the STUNNING Kingston Estate - a truly unique venue that we absolutely fell in love with. It had EVERYTHING we were looking for & more. The grounds are perfectly manicured all year round & come complete with walled garden. The cottages & main house are beautifully decorated, providing luxurious accommodation for 86 of our guests. Sarah & the team were such a pleasure to work with & couldn’t do enough for us. The catering was also top notch. Thank you"
V39,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue was great we had a few personal health issues beforehand but the team went above and beyond to make the day extra special. The wedding planner organised everything for us and they had plenty of props on site that we were free to use. We had the whole place to ourselves for the weekend it was brilliant and our friends loved the hot tub and pool.
V40,Holmewood Hall,"We were married at Holmewood Hall on 15th February 2025 and I can honestly say that it was the most magical day. We went to visit the venue and instantly fell in love with it but even we were blown away by how beautiful everything looked on the day. All of the staff were amazing - special shoutout to our personal wedding manager, Laura Pike, who was always on hand to answer any questions - she couldn’t do enough for us! The food was wonderful & we had full control over the menu. Would highly recommend this venue, you won’t regret it!"
V40,Holmewood Hall,"Holmewood Hall was an absolutely perfect wedding venue. The house is stunning, well cared for and beautifully decorated. All of the staff are so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Our Wedding Coordinator was fantastic, available from early morning of the wedding and was still there the morning after working for us. The food was excellent, drinks and canapes were amazing and the venue took care of everything for us. We had the most perfect wedding and are so pleased we chose Holmewood Hall. The Gold Room where we had our ceremony is gorgeous. Thank you for giving us a beautiful wedding!"
V40,Holmewood Hall,"I cannot fault this venue at all, the venue itself is breathtakingly beautiful with magnificent rooms and very lovingly maintained grounds. The staff are incredibly friendly, professional and efficient, our wedding coordinator Lee was a pleasure to work with and made our special day run smoothly. If you want a hassle free wedding with breathtaking grounds and the most amazing staff then this is the venue for you."
V40,Holmewood Hall,"Had the most amazing wedding here recently and cannot recommend it enough.

The venue itself is stunning and the options included in the luxe package covered everything we could've possibly wanted and made planning the wedding 100x less stressful.

The staff were all amazing from start to finish, Katie showed us around initially and then Lee was our personal wedding manager, and they were both incredible throughout. Always on hand to answer any questions and help us through the day once we got there.
We had so many comments from our guests on how lovely the staff were on the day!

A particular highlight though was the food - the tasting evening was a dream and the chef went above and beyond to provide a full vegan menu for us which wasn't limited to only a couple of options.
Again, we had so many non-vegan guests complimenting the food and saying how lovely it was!

Overall, an incredible day and an incredible venue.
Thank you so much to everyone there!"
V40,Holmewood Hall,"This place is simply just amazing 🤩
We had our wedding here on 17-12-24 and it was everything we dreamed of and more. The food, staff, decor were just perfect not forgetting the most beautiful Christmas tree 😍
Our person wedding planner Lee was an absolute god send not just having him there on the day but always being at the end of a phone to answer any questions or worry’s.
If we could go back and do it all again we would and not change a single thing.
The most perfect day at the most perfect venue ♥️"
V40,Holmewood Hall,Perfect venue for a wedding with guest numbers 60 - 100. Our guests and I moved from each room to a new room throughout the day and every room had a new surprise. The bridal suite was lush and it was great having all our guests staying under one roof. I would 100% recommend this to anyone.
V40,Holmewood Hall,"The wedding day and lead up to the day were fab. However, for the price we paid, we expected a little bit more.
I opted to use the bridal cottage the evening before for which we paid £450 extra. This is something I now regret, as there was no hot water and we were not able to order any food in as all the take away options were shut (on a Friday night). The hot tub also needed a good clean. So the night before/morning of my wedding was not ideal. I flagged this to the manager who advised that we should have raised the cold water issue as soon as possible, but seeing as we were trying to have morning showers on the wedding day, this did not leave us any time.
Our package included pre-drinks, wine with dinner and we also purchased a cocktail ""cart"" (cocktails on a table) and a bucket of beers. The groom, who is not a wine fan, asked for a beer with his wedding meal and was presented with a contactless card machine to pay for it at the top table. We felt this was a bit unnecessary as there was a full bucket of extra beers outside and it felt a little embarrassing having a card machine presented to us at the top table on our wedding day for one measly Corona, despite the huge amount we had paid. Also, guests were unknowingly allowed to buy beers from the bar after the meal, despite there being available beers to them already in a bucket next to the bar...
Overall the wedding was lovely, but for the price we paid we expected a bit better. Essentially, I loved the venue, but I wish we had not purchased any extras!"
V40,Holmewood Hall,"We got married at Holmewood Hall on 4th October 2024. From the first moment we stepped into the venue and I saw the magnificent Gold room I knew this would be the perfect place for us to get married. We had the most amazing day which was perfectly coordinated by the whole team at Holmewood but especially so by our personal wedding manager Lee. Lee was always quick to respond to any questions we had in the lead up to the day and nothing was too much trouble for him.
We honestly wish we could do it all over again as it was a magical day. We would recommend Holmewood Hall to anyone looking for the perfect venue."
V40,Holmewood Hall,"After getting engaged in late March this year we wanted to get married fairly quickly so booked Holmewood for the same September. The venue, grounds, accomodation were all stunning and we felt very fortunate it was within budget and the package we got was outstanding in comparison to other venues and what it included, which was far far more than other venues. We got to attend a luxe event to choose all our wedding food, canapés, cocktails and wines which should have made things easier but due to the unbelievable quality it made it harder! Our wedding planner Lee is literally the most fantastic person. He was flexible, fun, engaged and on absolutely everything. The day was ran impeccably and also smooth even with some weather concerns and speeches taking a bit longe than we thought. If you book here ask for Lee!! We had the most perfect day. Can’t fault a single things. Our guests all told us how incredible everything was with one even saying he will now longer not attend any further weddings unless it’s at Holmewood. Thank you to all the staff and as mentioned a huge special thank you to Lee! Your a legend!"
V40,Holmewood Hall,"Exceptional venue, stunning grounds, fantastic DJ, and excellent service. Highly recommended! Happiest day of my life 😊"
V41,Bourton Hall,"We got married at Bourton Hall on 08 March 2025 and our wedding planner was Harminder. The day was absolutely amazing from start to finish. All the food and drinks were of a high standard and presented beautifully which includes the wedding breakfast, canapés and cocktails, and breakfast the next day. The venue is gorgeous with lots of rooms, well maintained grounds and exclusive use. The staff are friendly and accommodating and the event was really well managed. We would like to particularly thank Harminder, who was supportive throughout the wedding planning process and the wedding day, ensuring things ran smoothly and in a timely manner. He is a great communicator, provided advice and guidance where needed and attention to detail. We really had a magical day! Thank you so much! We would happily do it all over again and would definitely recommend this venue!"
V41,Bourton Hall,"What a fabulous wedding venue! Because it's a wedding venue and not a hotel that holds the occasional wedding, they really focused on what was important and anticipated our every need. It's an elegant venue but with a comfortable feel to it. The team are incredibly accommodating and helpful and each couple is allocated their own personal wedding manager to guide them through the process and to make sure every detail is covered.
There's a beautiful chapel on site where non-religious ceremonies can be held - this was fabulous.
The food was plentiful and delicious - all our guests raved about it. Great choice of welcome drinks and canapes, wines and cocktails.
The grounds are gorgeous; a perfect backdrop for our October wedding.
The venue was exclusively ours and has beautiful bedrooms, including a huge, stunning bridal suite. Most of our guests stayed overnight and took advantage of the brilliant breakfast in the morning so it really extended the celebration."
V41,Bourton Hall,"Our wedding at Bourton Hall was better than we ever imagined. The Italianate mansion is truly spectacular inside and out however it is the team that made our day run perfectly. Our guests found the setting and the food incredible, they were very impressed! Our wedding planner Emily Sarjant was fantastic her knowledge and expertise made our day magical from start to finish, with all the special touches that she suggested. Our first dance was created in such a beautiful way it will be a memory we cherish forever. Thank you to Emily and the team at Bourton Hall. My husband would also like to note that the croquembouche was amazing and everyone should have one."
V41,Bourton Hall,"My wife and I got married at Bourton Hall in September, with our wedding managed by the wonderful Eleni. Everything about the day went as perfectly as we could've wished, right from arrival to departure the following day. The venue is stunning, and the food was lovely, and having 21 bedrooms on site was such a bonus so that all of our close friends and family could stay on site with us.
Bourton Hall did everything they could both in the run up to the day and on the day itself to alleviate all stress to ensure everything ran as seamlessly as possible, which it absolutely did.
We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall enough."
V41,Bourton Hall,"We were married on 28th July 2024. What an amazing day we had at Bourton Hall. Could not fault it! The venue is so elegant! The grounds and views were to die for. The food was out of this world with so many choices and all cooked and served to perfection. Accommodation / rooms were plentiful and luxurious. Lovely to have a chapel on site too. We had the whole place to ourselves, we felt like royalty! Lots of varied rooms and areas for people to choose where they wanted to be after the wedding breakfast. We would choose the venue all over again!"
V41,Bourton Hall,"We had both our wedding ceremony and reception at Bourton Hall and the service was superb throughout. The house and grounds are beautiful with amazing views to go with them. The staff were professional and helpful during the lead up to our wedding day and during the day as well - even when we had an emergency prior to the ceremony which caused delays, the venue staff were able to work around this to move timings back in order to allow all of our planned activities to go ahead and be fully enjoyed. All the food was delicious and we had a wonderful wedding day thanks to Bourton Hall."
V41,Bourton Hall,"We had the most perfect wedding day at Bourton Hall. Throughout the planning process and on the day, the team were so professional, which meant we could relax and know that everything was in their capable hands - Emily was an amazing wedding manager. The building is beautiful inside and out, and the grounds are stunning - there are so many places for beautiful photos, and views out over the countryside. The food was absolutely delicious, it was so hard to choose what to have! It was also so helpful to have so many places for guests to sit and chat in the evening, away from the disco room but still part of the action. Having so many bedrooms onsite (not to mention a stunning bridal suite!) was an added bonus. We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall highly enough, and have had so many comments from guests saying what a beautiful, elegant but relaxed day it was, so I know they really appreciated everything Bourton has to offer too. Thank you so much to Emily and the whole team for giving us such a perfect day!"
V41,Bourton Hall,"As the Bride and Groom we were made to feel like nothing was too much to ask and they couldn't do enough to make us feel special.
All the guests commented that it was one of the prettiest and most relaxed weddings they have been to.
We could not have asked for a better wedding day thanks to Bourton!"
V41,Bourton Hall,"I had my wedding on 10/02/2024 I am so happy I chose this venue, It is really magical. My wedding manager was just the best! Emily went above and beyond to help me on my big day! I cannot thank her enough.

One of the main things about this venue is that t has its own chappel which is really special and makes you wedding seem more traditional, however there are more options/ rooms available. I wanted the wow factor and I got it.

Some of the options that made it great

*Onsite accommodation for night before and night of the wedding is really helpful
*Exclusive use
*Dedicated wedding manager definate gamechanger! (Emily)
*Menu choices are fantastic.

Everyone commented on the food being really nice ( we had the lamb) The evening buffet was also great. I paid extra to have a meal created as having part of my culture within the food at the wedding was very important to me, they did not disappoint.
Emily was perfect in so many ways, she knew exactly my vision once i explained it to her and she made sure that it became real for me. She adapted parts of the day so that it would work better, for example bringing the canapes outside whilst photos where being taken. Helping me into my dress, looking after my phone just everything I needed she was there. She really worked hard to make sure it run perfectly and it did.

Thank you emily!!! You made my day Great."
V41,Bourton Hall,We got married at Bourton Hall on 30th July 2023. It was the most amazing day ever! We are still receiving compliments from our guests on how stunning the venue was and the whole running of the day. This was 100% down to our wedding co-ordinator Harminder. He went above and beyond to ensure our day was absolutely perfect. He literally could not have done any more! Thank you again Harminder!!
V42,B&H Buildings,Bourne & Hollingsworth was such an exceptional venue for our wedding this September. This is the perfect place for you if you want a true London wedding that feels like a fun dinner/house party but on an epic scale. We used the top floor (the studios) for our sit down dinner (think candle light and tasty roast lamb) and headed downstairs for our reception with the basement club (below and hidden) for late night dancing. The place is stunning (greenery and glass everywhere and the cocktails are insane but what really makes this place are the people. The whole staff from Matt and Lizzie to the bar team to the dinner crew made our whole day seamless and so fun. Could not recommend B&H more highly for your London wedding.
V42,B&H Buildings,"Beautiful wedding celebration in the most stylish venue - we had an intimate wedding reception (drinks, dinner and more drinks!) at the Bourne & Hollingsworth Buildings. The staff members on duty were excellent - nothing was too much trouble and they served everyone with such professionalism. We couldn’t recommend it highly enough and we haven’t stopped talking about it since. All of our guests were so impressed with the space and how stylish it was. The bar, restaurant and greenhouse are all aesthetically beautiful and the botanical vibes make for a very relaxed, but premium setting. Special shout out to Lizzie who helped us coordinate everything and Matt on the day who led the team. Thank you so much - we had the best day and we couldn’t have wished to host it in a better venue."
V42,B&H Buildings,"India & the B&H team were seamless. Flexible, responsive, kind, and easy to deal with. They made our day so special. The food was fantastic, the drinks were lovely, and the value for money was first rate!"
V43,Leez Priory,"I never in my life thought I would get married in a place like Leez priory! The whole experience from start to finish was just fantastic. The price breakdown was manageable and there was no pressure to take any upgrades offered. The things we got in our package were phenomenal and having a wedding planner was tremendous - our lady (Leanne) was an absolute god send!
They catered to all our needs and we were made to feel so comfortable and nothing was a problem! I’d highly suggest going to an event there before hand, just to get a feel of what it’s like full of people and enjoy their delicious food. We actually enjoyed their entertainer ( singer) so much we hired him for our wedding ☺️
Lee priory is just so beautiful. I can’t speak highly enough x"
V43,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory on the 7th of September 2024. Considering how long they have been a wedding venue, they were pretty flexible with some of the ideas we had for the venue styling that turned out amazingly!

The staff really made the day something special and couldn't have done enough for us. Special mention must be made for Leanne, our wedding planner, who was amazing!

Highly recommend the venue and the incredible team that helped to make our day so special!"
V43,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in October 2024. This venue is stunning both inside and out with immaculately kept grounds and interior. The hospitality in the lead up to and on the day of the wedding was fantastic. The food was also brilliant. Another great perk of this venue is the amount of on site accommodation.

A couple of drawbacks / experiences during our wedding. There are only a few toilets in the main building which kept blocking and overflowing throughout the evening which led to us taking some guests to the dressing room or honeymoon cottage to use the facilities. You are also restricted by the venue on any external food or drink suppliers and the venues optional extras for this are quite expensive for what they are.

That asaide, we had the best day and evening at Leez Priory and would certainly recommend it!"
V43,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in August 2024- great venue and experience from initial viewing to leaving the morning after the wedding. Leanne acted as our wedding planner and was friendly, professional and helpful throughout. We opted for the classic package and the food was amazing quality with everyone commenting how full they were!
The venue is beautiful with several options for ceremony both inside and out. Accommodation was great too. The whole day ran smoothly with perfect weather - we will have very happy memories of our day!"
V43,Leez Priory,"Perfect venue and very attentive staff, lovely food and great communication from start to finish"
V43,Leez Priory,"Stunning venue. Fantastic Team. Very accommodating toward our unique ""surprise"" strategy. Our guests were truly surprised. Thank you."
V43,Leez Priory,"Leez priory was the 1st and only venue we looked around when we started planning our wedding. From the moment we stepped on the premises, everything just looked so perfect and exactly what we wanted from a wedding venue. When we got assigned our wedding co-ordinator Rachel, she was just absolutely spot on with everything we asked for and nothing was too big an ask for her. She made sure the day ran as smoothly as possible and took care of any issue that arose without me knowing (which I am forever grateful for!!)
The rest of the staff were amazing and very helpful.

The venue itself is just absolutely stunning and we loved that it has the pub area as well as the dance floor so it catered to all of our guests.

All of the rooms were lovely and it was so nice being able to stay in the fisherman’s lodge onsite the night before the wedding.

We genuinely cannot recommend this venue enough and it was 100% worth the money! 10/10!"
V43,Leez Priory,"We got married on a Tuesday in October to maximise the value of what we could get for our money; and honestly, we got everything we wanted and more. Leanne, our Wedding Manager was perfect at bringing an attention to detail and seamless organisation to the big day, and in the lead up. There wasn't one moment of the day where we felt stressed, as Leanne had it covered. In one particular instance, our flowers for the bridal party's hair hadn't arrived. Within five minutes of telling Leanne that we needed this, the flowers were with our hair and make-up suppliers to add the finishing touches.

Leez Priory as a venue is the most stunning setting, and offers an incredible range of areas in which the ceremony and reception can take place. There is also the opportunity for the bridal party to make use of the Fisherman's Cottage the night before the wedding, and for people to stay in the on-site accommodation on the evening of the wedding, making it the perfect venue for people also travelling from further afield.

Leez Priory were very accommodating, welcoming and were happy to work with us to make our day as perfect as possible. The food was incredible, and a total hit with all of our guests, and so many people have commented on how incredible the day was as a whole. You wouldn't be disappointed to choose Leez Priory."
V43,Leez Priory,They catered to our every need. To when we would ask for things they hadn’t been done before they still made sure it went smoothly. Leanne was amazing she made me feel so comfortable from the start. The whole day was stunning. Beautiful venue please go view it as you will not be disappointed
V43,Leez Priory,We got married on the 26 May 2024. This venue was absolutely brilliant! They catered for every need and made sure there was no stress on the day. Leanne was kind and level headed throughout and was always one step ahead! Do not hesitate to book- do it now!
V44,London Rowing Club,"We picked this place because we wanted somewhere fairly central and casual. We fell in love with the long room and the view. Our wedding was in October so we thought we'd have it cosy but we ended up with a beautiful autumnal day so everyone was on the balcony. The fairy lights were perfect and the other rooms were great to avoid leaving. The staff was so friendly and accommodating that we would definitely recommend the venue.

The only thing that could have tainted the day is that after three visits and many emails, we were never told that the river floods (a lot). We were flexible with our day so if we knew this we would have built it into our day, instead, I was told by the photographer on the day as I got out of the taxi that we wouldn't be able to take any group photos because the area would be flooded during the cocktail hour and half that we had assigned as photo time. This would have been disappointing but we all ended up running outside after the ceremony to take photos before the tide came in. My husband and I borrowed wellies for our couple photos. We had fun doing this, but I can imagine many couples being upset! My friend's electric car also flooded and they were obviously upset."
V44,London Rowing Club,"Annabel was meticulous in her help planning the wedding. Very knowledgeable and helpful.
On the day the rest of the staff were brilliant - there wasn’t an empty glass in the house.
Great venue at a reasonable price on the London riverside."
V44,London Rowing Club,"LRC was the perfect place to celebrate our wedding this summer. The venue staff went above and beyond to ensure that everything went as planned both before and during the event. Thanks in particular to Annabel who was responsive, helpful and always put us at ease in the build up. The location is stunning - couldn’t have asked for a better day!"
V44,London Rowing Club,"We just wanted to say an enormous thank you for everything. From the moment we came to visit the LRC on a slightly grey January weekend, we knew it would be a fabulous venue for our June wedding reception and it certainly did not disappoint. It really is the most beautiful setting and we have very fond memories of our guests enjoying drinks in the sunshine with the most fantastic view over the Thames. The venue has such character and lends itself beautifully to a wedding reception. We have received so many compliments from our guests and I would encourage anyone thinking about booking their wedding at the LRC to do it, you will not regret it! We were lucky to be blessed with beautiful weather so were able to have our jazz musicians play on the balcony for the drinks reception before moving into the Long Room for our meal. It looked stunning with the tables dressed and mantles adorned with flowers. Following the meal and speeches, guests enjoyed drinks back on the balcony and in the Fairburn and Members Rooms which provide plenty of seating, whilst the Long Room was cleared and the band set up. We then partied the night away.

From start to finish, the organisation was so straight forward. Annabel was very accommodating and full of helpful advice in the run up. I knew that on the day she would ensure things ran like clock work, which of course they did. Our suppliers also commented on how helpful the LRC team were to work with. On the day the staff were brilliant and went out of their way to ensure everything ran smoothly (including borrowing some large gym fans from the rowers to put in the Long Room to keep us cool as it was an unexpectedly hot day). We really can’t thank you enough and now need to think of an excuse to host another party with you in the future!"
V44,London Rowing Club,"We got married in St. Mary's church and then had our reception in the London Rowing Club in February 2023. It far exceeded our expectations and was an incredible fabulous stress-free day with thanks to the wonderful Annabel making the day just run.

In the lead up to the event, Annabel was incredibly responsive, helpful and helped us plan the day exactly how we wanted it. She answered all our questions really quickly, always got back to us, was very flexible with what we could do and allowing us to personalise the space. Prior to the event, Annabel arranged for us to go and have a look around on a couple of additional occasions to help us plan how we would want it to look. She also gave our caterers a tour of the kitchens as they were new to the venue.

In the immediate lead up to the day, Annabel helped with our suppliers in getting chairs delivered and bringing all the wine over a day earlier. On the day, she helped to make the day flow and just dealt with things throughout the day.

The venue itself is beautiful with three rooms to use. A middle reception room, a cosy snug and the main long room. In the main long room, there is a rowing boat hanging upside down with fairly lights. The main lighting can be dimmed and gave a wonderful atmosphere for the evening meal. As our wedding was a winter wedding, it was fairly chilly so they lit fires in the main room and snug which added to the atmosphere.

We had around 90 guests - could have fitted a few more just about. We used the round tables, tablecloths, linen, plates cutlery and glasses provided and they were perfect for a wedding and looked very smart. No need to hire these. As mentioned, we did hire separate wedding chairs instead of the conference chairs provided. There's a lot of decoration in the way of rowing memorabilia on the walls which means you don't have to actually do too much to make it interesting for guests.

Overall, the perfect London wedding venue with absolutely fabulous views across the Thames with a long balcony to enjoy from. To top it off Annabel is truly amazing and so helpful."
V44,London Rowing Club,"We had our wedding (ceremony+reception) at LRC in July, and the venue itself and the team we worked with were absolutely incredible! Everything on the day went without a hitch and we heard so many compliments on the location - our guests loved the balcony and the layout inside, which included plenty of space for anyone wanting a break from dancing to sit down and relax. Would recommend to anyone looking to host an event!"
V44,London Rowing Club,"London Rowing Club is a truly fantastic venue and we were both so delighted with how our day went! The venue has real character with the classic rowing memorabilia and it’s location on the Thames, and looks amazing when it’s all set up. The layout and size of rooms I thought were perfect for our wedding of about 70 (+15ish more in the evenings) and of course the big attraction is the balcony which all of our guests adored!! (I wish I’d had more time during the day to stand out there and enjoy it 😂). Not only is it a fantastic venue in a great location but what really made this the most amazing venue was how great all of the staff, and all the recommend suppliers were! The day exceeded expectations and we got compliments on the place and the staff from all our guests. Couldn’t be happier with the venue, it was perfect for us!!"
V44,London Rowing Club,"We found the London Rowing Club while desperately combing through London locations after our original venue fell through a few months before the day.
Luckily for us it was available due to a cancellation - kismet!
From the start the charming Annabel put us very much at ease and helped us to envisage the day as we hoped it would be. She was very flexible and helpful throughout the planning process.
We were incredibly lucky with the weather on the day and the venue really came into its own - it was virtually impossible to get guests off the terrace, which is the perfect size for our smallish event (65 people) and of course offers gorgeous river views.
We were well looked after by the team and everything went off without a hitch. The interior of the space itself is lovely with a great sense of history.
Nice additional touch - table tennis was made available in the entry room for the later part of the evening!

It's a special place and I'd thoroughly recommend for anyone seeking a memorable spot to tie the knot!"
V44,London Rowing Club,"We got married at the London Rowing Club on a brilliantly sunny winter day on Saturday. All the way through in the run up (after 2 years or more of postponements), Annabel and team bent over backwards to help us arrange everything, recommended some brilliant suppliers for food (Shona Pollock comes highly recommended) and flowers (same with Steph the charityflorist.)

So many of our guests said how lovely the venue and staff were on the day, and the whole place looked a million dollars with an amazing photo set on and around the balcony and river - although we haven't seen those yet. The corkage and bar tariff prices are also incredibly reasonable for an inner London location!

I can't recommend the LRC highly enough. It will live in memory for a very long time."
V44,London Rowing Club,"The London Rowing Club team alongside the Dinner Ladies went above and beyond to ensure that we had the wedding perfectly fitting our requirements. Throughout the entire all of the suppliers worked seamlessly together to ensure the space transformed as we progressively added guests and transitioned between eating, our ceremony, more eating, music and dancing. We wouldn’t have had it any other way. The attention to detail of the team is second to none - perfect for any bride and groom seeking a beautiful event."
V45,The Prince Albert,"The team at The Prince Albert were always accommodating, made everything easy and stress-free, and helped us organise an amazing wedding party. They really knew what they were doing, and helped guide us through the process calmly, working around our schedule (which wasn't easy - we live abroad!) to make sure all our last-minute worries and concerns were sorted smoothly. The food was excellent, and the space was fantastic for our party. Can't recommend it highly enough!"
V45,The Prince Albert,"We had such a happy wedding with Harrison and this venue. Harrison was really flexible and answered any questions we had and made great suggestions when we needed seating arrangements, the schedule for the day, a florist, and more. The day was accessible to everyone and the food and drink were perfect. Thank you for making out wedding stress free and wonderful."
V45,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert was the most wonderful venue for our London wedding. We came across the venue at there wedding fair and chose alot of our suppliers from the same wedding fair.

Harrison and Lauren were always so on hand to help with any questions and did a fantastic job answering all of our questions. The staff were so friendly and helpful and made everything run like clockwork.

We couldn’t recommend The Prince Albert enough for a london wedding and would love to do it all again."
V45,The Prince Albert,"My wife and I were beyond happy with how everything went on our wedding day. Harrison, Diana, Claudio and the whole team were absolutely phenomenal! It was such a beautifully efficient operation, and we always felt like someone was there to help us when needed.

We've had dozens of compliments about the great food and how wonderfully intimate the venue was for a wedding. Some of our more traditional relatives said they were initially sceptical at the prospect of a pub wedding, but that it was one of the most beautiful and joyful weddings they’d been to. A friend of mine was also very happy that someone at the bar remembered her drink order throughout the evening! On top of that, everything ran perfectly to schedule, which is no doubt down to the high attention to detail.

It was very useful that the upstairs was free on Friday afternoon so that we could set up the space. It gave us plenty of time to do the flower arrangements, put up the bunting, and stick photos on the frame wall.

Thank you again so much for all the help and support you've given us - it really was the best day of our lives (so far)!"
V45,The Prince Albert,"My husband and I got married here in late September 2023, and I cannot recommend the Prince Albert enough!! Booking a wedding venue can be stressful and we felt like a lot of the venues we looked at gave us the ""hard sell"" but the folks at the Prince Albert helped to put us at ease every step of the way. We fell in love with how beautiful the pub was, so hired the upstairs for the ceremony, wedding breakfast and party afterwards for around 40 - 45 people. We were able to drop off decorations the night before and talk it all through with the staff, and they did such a good job of working with us and the florist to get the place looking amazing. The ceremony went off without a hitch, everybody loved the food and we had a blast in the evening. All the staff were amazing, but special shout out to Harrison and Lauren for helping us plan and run the day, and Maria for managing everything on the ground both when we dropped off the decorations and during the wedding itself. Thank you again for helping us celebrate our special day with our loved ones, for making it so stress free and so memorable!"
V45,The Prince Albert,"All you ever hear about wedding venues is that everything is a rip off, the food is meh, and there are a ton of annoying restrictions...the opposite is true of Harrison and The Prince Albert team. From Day 1, Harrison made the whole process not only easy but really fun! He was quick to respond, super knowledgeable, and very accommodating; he even helped our best man execute a surprise for us without it disrupting any timings. On the day, they decorated the place beautifully, managed to serve a 3 course dinner to 76 people unbelievably fast, and everyone raved about the food - to say they did a good job is a gross understatement, they went above and beyond. We were after ""classy fun"" and that's exactly what we got - thank you so so much!"
V45,The Prince Albert,"We had the exact wedding reception we wanted at the Prince Albert thanks to Harrison, Claudio and the other amazing staff who helped us feel so relaxed in the build up and during. We wanted a very low-key vibe and the team understood that but there were enough options for any style of wedding you wanted. The upstairs function room felt cozy and intimate while still leaving breathing room and space to dance, but you could easily rent the whole place if you wanted more guests and even choose to do your ceremony there. We had the most compliments on our food (we chose a buffet option). The team were particularly accomodating to some complicated dietary requirements and it was all delicious."
V45,The Prince Albert,"July 6, 2023 was the most memorable day of our lives! A big thank you to Harrison and the rest of the team for assisting us through out the whole process. Our guests loved the Prince Albert pub especially the sumptuous food and booze on our wedding day!

David & Dannah"
V45,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert is a Great venue for the classic Pub Wedding.
Harrison and the team did an amazing job to organize everything. The food was great and the service first class. Only sorry it was over so quickly. Thanks again for everything."
V45,The Prince Albert,"We found The Prince Albert when our original venue cancelled on us less than 2 months before our wedding. & we are so glad we did; everything happens for a reason! From the moment we met Harrison, we knew we were in safe hands, and the team at the Prince Albert made our day amazing. The pub looked beautiful and we were very greatful for the effort the team put in putting up all our decorations. We had so many compliments about the food, and we were very impressed in the swift and organised manner in whichever it was served. Everyone had a wonderful time, and we would not hesitate in recommending The Prince Albert."
V46,Kindred,"We chose Kindred for our 60 person wedding and it could not have been better. We wanted a venue where we could have the ceremony, dinner and dancing all under one roof, that was wheelchair accessible, and easy to get to on the tube, Kindred ticks all those boxes and more!
The food is incredible, we really enjoyed popping by to do all the tastings, we'll continue to come to the Cellar for food and cocktails. Many guests commented on how good the food was.
The place itself is gorgeous, inside and out. We used the whole venue, the main Hall for the ceremony, dinner and dancing, and the Library upstairs for the drinks reception and cake cutting. Also, being right next to Hammersmith station, the venue could not be easier to get to!
The staff are wonderfully attentive and helpful, both before and on the day. They were really open to the little details that made our day uniquely ours, from the drinks selections, to having a table and glasses on stage for the ceremony, to playing our music selections at the right time. Plus its a dog friendly venue!"
V46,Kindred,"We LOVE this venue! We got married here with only 12 weeks notice and Anna, the owner, and her staff went above and beyond to make the day as memorable, magical, and marvellous as we'd hoped it would be. The venue is elegant, stylish and perfect for a London, city based wedding. The food is sensational as it comes from their in-house kitchen on the ground floor and every guest remarked on how delicious their meal was. It's restaurant quality food, not your standard wedding food. The place looks stunning in all our wedding photos and the wedding cake they made us (at very short notice I might add!) was second to none. Everyone loved it. The venue was also perfect for late night dancing and drinking and merriment. It was such a pleasure - and a breeze - to work with Anna and her team on one of the most important days of my life, and I very much hope to do so again in the future. I will forever be grateful to her and all she helped us with."
V46,Kindred,"We had our wedding reception for 35 guests at Kindred, in the Library and Salon earlier this year. The day went incredibly smoothly, the staff couldn't have been more attentive and our guests raved about the food for weeks afterwards. It was the perfect sized space for our intimate celebration, really cosy and the atmosphere was great. The little touches really helped to make the day special, with espresso martinis served for the speeches and sparklers for our exit at the end of the night. Thanks again to the lovely Kindred team!"
V46,Kindred,"I cannot find a single fault in our experience with Kindred for our wedding. Not only was it a stunning venue that honestly made some of our guests gasp as they arrived, but Anna and the team were so incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. Having them support us really took so much of the wedding planning stress away and we knew we were in safe hands. I really appreciated that the team were happy to chat through ideas with me and were always keen to find creative solutions to give us the day that we had envisioned.

The food was absolutely delicious and they were so accommodating for our long list of dietary requirements from our guest. The cocktails were also so delicious. Our guests were buzzing for weeks after, as were we.

On the night, the staff were not only incredibly helpful and efficient, but also just so friendly, welcoming and complimentary. We felt thoroughly spoilt and very well looked after.

We visited so many venues and this was by far the best choice for us. The interiors made for some stunning photos and the layout of the spacing meant that whilst we had 80-100 guests, it still felt very intimate. I cannot recommend Kindred enough!"
V46,Kindred,"We would give a thousand stars if we could. Kindred hosted us for our cocktail style wedding and it was everything we could have hoped for and the perfect venue for this style of wedding. The wine, cocktails and food (incredible grazing board, canapés, bowls and pizzas) were exceptional and the team were on top of everything, friendly and nothing was ever an issue. We would HIGHLY recommend it. We have had loads of guests message us to tell us what a spectacular venue it was with the most friendly team. The venue had different spaces to suit our needs and the AV is amazing - it worked perfectly for our live music band and our DJ, and our own music playlists for our ceremony. They took the stress off planning and really did mean we could relax and not worry that everything would run smoothly. Thank you so much Kindred team for giving us the best day of our lives"
V47,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The best day of our lives and me and my now husband couldn't be more thankful to Bredenbury. Before booking Bredenbury we visited over 17 wedding venues in Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Herefordshire - we fell in love instantly, there is no need for a crazy amount of extra expense on decorations, the venue speaks for itself. The fact that it was no corkage just added to why we wanted to book and the team were so friendly. In the lead up to the wedding they were brilliant, we booked far in advance and brought over all our family members to come see the venue, they were so flexible, understanding and welcoming - they couldn't do enough for us. On the wedding day they had decorated for us by the time we had arrived and all we had to do on the day was to enjoy it - which was perfect. It really was the best day of our lives, all the comments from our family and friends was how beautiful the venue was. They kept the day running so smooth and we didn't need to think about a thing."
V47,Bredenbury Court Barns,"There truly aren't words to describe how incredible Bredenbury Court Barns and their entire team of fantastic staff were through the planning process and the day itself. They were so friendly, supportive and nothing was ever too much. From quick replies to any questions that popped to mind to planning meetings that left us feeling prepared and ready to the day being set up beyond perfectly. Our amazing wedding coordinator Lianna spent the days and months (years really!) leading up to our big day making sure everyone detail was perfect, that everything was incorporated that we'd dreamed of and made sure we didn't feel a moment of stress from start to finish. All throughout the building from the bridal booth, to the orangery to the oak barn was beautifully light and open - even with our wedding being the end of October - and we had so many compliments about this! There aren't enough words to say thank you and explain just how much we'd recommend this venue to everyone"
V47,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We had the perfect day back in July. The weather didn't go to plan but they helped make the day so special even with the last minute switches because of the rain. We had such an amazing day and the feedback from our guests about the venue, food and service was great! We cannot thank the team enough for the effort they put in throughout the whole process but especially on the day. We felt incredibly supported throughout the whole process."
V47,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The venue itself is stunning. The buildings, grounds and interior decorations are all beautiful and immaculately presented. From the moment you turn down the lane it is so picturesque, you know you've found somewhere special. It's exactly what we were imagining for our wedding venue.

The layout is perfect, with ample space for guests to mingle and move about, and great accessibility for older and disabled guests. Ours was a winter wedding, and while most of the day was inside it wasn't cramped and we could still enjoy the beautiful grounds through the expansive windows that run along the whole barn.

All of the venue is stunning, but practicality-wise the Bridal Suite warrants a special mention. Room length mirrors, plenty of room for the bridal party to get ready, have their makeup and hair done, and if there's time to relax as well. Drinks were served from 11 onwards, and it has it's own toilets and shower.

From our first meeting at Bredenbury the staff were exceptional. They gave a reassuring air of professionalism and experience, with just the right level of excitedness for our day without it feeling forced. We were really impressed by how responsive the whole team were, with speedy replies to any questions we had during the planning. This is something we particularly appreciated as we only gave ourselves 7 weeks to plan our big day.

Value for money wise it felt tricky to gauge when we were trying to choose a venue as the headline figure is rarely what you'll end up paying, with different venues charging different amounts for different things. Not the case with Bredenbury. With their No Corkage policy and generosity in being able to use whatever props they already have, any extras were non-essentials of our own choosing.

No Corkage is pretty significant. Some venues wanted to charge £20/bottle, so not having to pay this and being able to supply not only our own wine but beers, gin and soft drinks for the drinks reception and wedding breakfast was not only a massive saving but also made the occasion more personal for us. The bar staff and catering team were excellent, pouring and serving drinks, warming our mulled wine and setting up the gin bar. Once your guests have drunk you dry the venue's bar is well stocked and standard pub pricing.

We wanted a Christmas wedding and seeing in early November that they had a date available that December we couldn't resist. 7 weeks isn't long to organise a wedding with nearly 100 guests, and we couldn't have done it without the Bredenbury team being so organised. Our assigned event manager, Harriet, was brilliant in the runup and on the day, as were all the other managers and staff we spoke with. The Wedding Bible they fill out with you is a great idea and nails down all the finer details to ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible on the day.

We didn't want to have to spend the day before and morning of our wedding worrying about set up and decorations, but needn't have worried as Bredenbury did all of this for us. A meeting beforehand clarified what we wanted where; we simply dropped off boxes of stuff the day before and rocked up in the morning to find everything laid out as hoped.

This organisation extended to the third party suppliers, of which Bredenbury have an extensive list of local recommendations. We booked the ceiling lights with Cotswold Wedding Co. and didn't have to do anything else. The band, Apollo Gold (incredible!!) set up without any hassle and didn't have any issues with Bredenbury's noise limiter. Our florist Katrina Bevis hadn't been there before, but again had no problem getting everything in place on the morning.

On-site accommodation was good for close family and friends, but there's not enough for the majority of guests and the lack of a dedicated honeymoon suite is a bit of a shame. If you want privacy for your first night as a married couple it means taking over an entire lodge. The quality and comfort of the rooms is excellent, though, and the continental breakfast served the morning after in the East Lodge was delicious, with ample options for Vegan and Gluten Free.

Jenkinsons are the exclusive caterer for Bredenbury and have an extensive menu for nibbles, the wedding breakfast and dinner. The menu and ordering process is clear, and pricing is what we expected to pay. Food and service was as slick and faff-free as everything else. A real delight.

On the day, Harriet and the catering manager were absolute superstars. Zero stress, everything ran to time and as planned, and they were always available if we had any questions or needed help.

The whole day was perfect and exactly what we wanted. I don't think we could have achieved this without the exceptional organisation of Harriet and the team. The entire process was very slick, zero stress, and we wouldn't hesitate in recommending Bredenbury Court Barns to anyone looking to get married in a countryside paradise."
V47,Bredenbury Court Barns,"I want to say a massive thank you to Bredenbury Court Barns for hosting our wedding. From the start they were super amazing and accommodating to us. They won us over with their care and support even when we had a pickle in the beginning.

Olivia was super helpful from the start and throughout the year we were planning she offered huge amount of support and suggestions.

We typed in “orangery weddings” in google when we were first looking because I was keen to get a ceremony in an orangery and Bredenbury popped up after much searching. Once we saw the Orangery we cancelled every other viewing we had across the country because we felt we found the perfect place, and nothing compared to the reception with the beautiful windows that brought all the light in. The grounds were absolutely spectacular and gorgeous. It was a no brainer for us to pick such a beautiful venue. They brought my ideas to life and we were able to get support on anything from recommendation of suppliers, to ideas on decor to their favourite meals from Jenkinson’s. They fully outdid themselves in love for us. We can’t forget it.

Our wedding day was exceptional with Lianna helping us all the way. She was a breath of fresh air. She cared about all the little details and made us feel relaxed and had a good laugh with us. The fact she was there 100% of the way, before the wedding, during the wedding, and even after is unmatched! Thank you Lianna for really being there to make our wedding day smooth and relaxing.

The food was incredible too and we often think about how sad it is that we didn’t finish our second plates, we think about it a lot.

Thank you for the wonderful journey BCB, you blew us away with your integrity, kindness, and genuine support!"
V47,Bredenbury Court Barns,thank you to everyone at bredenbury court barns who made our day so special
V47,Bredenbury Court Barns,"From the moment we stepped foot into Bredenbury Court Barns, we knew this was the venue for us. It was the first and only venue we viewed as we were blown away by how gorgeous the venue is. The venue itself is absolutely stunning, with breathtaking views and impeccably maintained grounds that set the perfect backdrop for our special day.

The staff went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. From our first consultation to the last dance, their professionalism and attention to detail were exceptional. Harriet was absolutely brilliant and I don’t know what we would have done without her!

The food was another highlight—our guests are still talking about how delicious everything was! Jenkinsons are amazing, they helped us personalise our menu perfectly!

We couldn’t have asked for a more beautiful venue to have our wedding. The day couldn’t have been more perfect! Thank you to everyone at Bredenbury Court Barns for making our wedding day nothing short of magical!"
V47,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We could not have had a more perfect experience with Bredenbury Court Barns. Right from initial booking all the way through to breakfast the following morning, everything was perfect. Nothing was too much trouble for our wonderful planner, Lianna. She ensured the day ran smoothly and our months of planning turned out exactly as we’d imagined. They are available to answer any questions you have any time, they’re only an email away and get back to you so fast. The venue itself if just gorgeous, the grounds make for some wonderful photos, and the orangery lets so much light in that your ceremony photos are gorgeous. The whole place is fully air conditioned too which was great for our July wedding. The bridal suite is a perfect balance of being aesthetically pleasing and practical for getting ready in, it’s so spacious, lots of natural light, there’s plenty of plug sockets and huge mirrors so everyone has plenty of room for getting ready and no one is on top of eachother. There’s even an outside space for getting some fresh air. I’m so glad we chose to have our wedding here, it’s given us memories to cherish forever and there are zero memories of any stress!! Cannot recommend this venue enough!"
V47,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We cannot believe how lucky we fell to get married at such a beautiful venue. Right from the offset of viewing the venue, to our special day, we were taken of. No question was too silly, and so much pressure was taken off us during the planning. We managed to make everything our own and Lianna was there every step of the way. Thank you for giving us our happily ever after. We will forever be grateful."
V47,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We loved our wedding at Bredenbury the team did an amazing job providing everything we asked for and more. We especially liked that our wedding coordinator for the day, Harriet had thought of everything for us she went above and beyond and even offered to go and get my mum some more shoes when hers broke! absolute 5-star service and the food was amazing too!"

V49,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow what can I say, Brinsop is an absolutely stunning wedding venue with heaps of character and so many options of places for the ceremony and to do things. We fell in love with it as soon as we saw it and knew it was where we wanted to get married.

Right from the start, the Brinsop team were so helpful and accommodating. From giving an virtual tour then showing us around in person, Issy and the team were fantastic right the way through. Nothing was a hassle, no request too difficult and they were incredibly professional and responsive throughout the whole process.

We loved that Brinsop is an exclusive venue with accommodation on site so we could stay with the bridal party and our immediate family. All the rooms are unique and have so much character and it's fun exploring the whole place. You feel like you are in the middle of nowhere, in nature with swans, ducks and birds all around.

Throughout our planning process, Issy and the team helped us every step of the way, being incredibly flexible in managing our requests and really trying to create our vision. They even got their team to make a giant jenga that we could use on the day! They helped to create the most perfect bespoke wedding breakfast and canapes menu, and seemed so positive and excited to be part of our special day and experience.

Arriving at the venue, Issy and the team were ready and had everything prepared and ready to go. It made the process so smooth for us and meant we could really enjoy the day without any stress. Issy coordinated perfectly with all of our vendors and it really felt like she and the whole team were so happy for us and wanted to be part of our day which was amazing. Our guests commented on how friendly and responsive all the staff were and it really made the experience extra special.

I wouldn't change anything about the day and it was perfect. I would absolutely recommend Brinsop as a wedding venue and all the staff who are really invested in helping deliver your vision. Thank you so so much to the whole team for making this a day that we will look back on for many years to come with amazing memories."
V49,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow, what a perfect day we had! It really went without a hitch and that was thanks to Nina and all the staff at Brinsop. The team worked seamlessly to ensure the day was as perfect as could be, and it really was! The wedding was booked over 2 years in advance and the staff were so accommodating with all my questions, planning and site visits, they couldn’t do more to support us. Special thanks to our coordinator Nina who was a delight to work with and a credit to Brinsop. Everyone that attended agreed at how beautiful the venue and grounds were, it was a wedding people won’t forget! 10/10 would recommend to anyone!"
V49,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"It's taken me quite a while to get round to writing this review, because sadly it's quite a bittersweet one.

We were married last year on 15 June and Brinsop was our chosen venue for both our ceremony and reception. We were first attracted to brinsop by the accomodation, meaning our loved ones could stay on-site, especially my grandparents which was so important to me.

The home itself is absolutely beautiful, including ivy cottage which myself and my mum stayed in the night before the big day. It really was a picture perfect setting, and looking down from the bridal suite seeing the ceremony space being set up on the Wordsworth lawn was honestly magical. Id dreamed of an outdoor wedding on that lawn, and we were so grateful the weather cleared so we could have it. The team really did wait till the latest they could to ask us to make a call on an inside or outside wedding (despite being June, it was a gloomy day to start) which I really appreciated!

Another amazing part of hiring brinsop was the after hours space we were able to enjoy until 2am with our house guests. The games room was absolute fantastic and meant that if you wanted to go to bed you could, but you could also stay up, party and play pool. I really do think this was a highlight for our guests and would recommend massively if you can spare some budget.

On the night of the wedding, myself and my new husband actually stayed in one glamping tents which we absolutely loved. The groundsman was on site until we were ready to leave the games room, and he then took us up to our tent in one of the buggies, making sure we had plenty of blankets and even stopping off for some bottles of water for us. This was really special, and can't thank him enough.

Hugo Spritz!! Having hugos at both our welcome drinks and drinks reception after the ceremony was amazing. I'm not a fan of prosecco myself and Mark and the team made it possible for us to have Hugo's all round. We even sneaked some up to the bridal suite to have before the ceremony (thanks Nadia!). Our guests loved them, and the amount of people that have told me they now need them at their own wedding is crazy!

Onto the not so good - sadly it all started to go a little downhill when we moved things into the knot barn for our wedding breakfast. Sitting on the top table, I could see that guests at the top of the second rows of long tables didn't really even have a seat around the table and were just kind of plonked on. The seating plan hadn't been followed, and I don't think there were even enough tables laid for the service to be comfortable for people because there was a dance floor at the end of the barn (which I did not ask for).

It was quickly also brought to my attention, that one of our guests had had to put her child on her lap in order to remove the high chair so people had more space. We also lost about 5 napkins with them setting on fire from the candles because everything was just way too cramped.

I asked to speak to catering, and asked if there was anything that they could do. I was told 'well sure, if you want the whole thing to be late'. In truth I shouldn't have even had to broach this myself, as it should have been sorted by the coordination team.

The tables weren't changed, even after they'd said they'd sort after the first course and yet the whole meal still ran late. We've had so much feedback about people not having enough food, food not being easy to access on the sharing platters etc and honestly when you've waited so long for a day and had spent 25k on the venue and food alone, it really has been heartbreaking to hear. I do sometimes question why people still bring it up (even now, people talk about the dining) when it clearly upset me so much.

Whilst writing this review my husband asked my what we had for evening food - we didn't get any. It was left unannounced on a back table. I don't know what I was expecting, just not that.

The next morning, the houseguests were asked to come down to breakfast for 9am (it was on a note in the room) but as we were in the glamping area, we walked past the knot barn just before 8.30 and the food was already out. We ran down to the house to hurry everyone up, and by which time everyone arrived it had been sitting there for 20plus mins going cold.

My biggest upset was that when I fed all of the above back to brinsop, feeling pretty deflated about the catering, I was told they'd pass my feedback on and heard absolutely nothing back. 25k total with over 10k on food and drinks to hear absolutely nothing, and this was 9 months ago. I'm not saying this in would happen to anyone else, but really - it shouldn't have happened to us either."
V49,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our wedding! From start to finish, everything at Brinsop was flawless. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most magical backdrop for our special day. Our guests were blown away by the beautiful venue, the warm atmosphere, and the seamless coordination. Every detail was taken care of, and we felt so well looked after. The team was incredible, professional, friendly, and attentive. On the day itself, they ensured everything ran smoothly, allowing us to truly enjoy every moment. A special mention goes to our amazing wedding coordinator Nina!"
V49,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We had our wedding on New Year's Eve 2024 at Brinsop, and it was more perfect that we could have ever hoped for. The venue itself is stunning, with beautiful spacious rooms which slept over 40 of our guests. Our coordinator, Nina, was incredible and so supportive on the day - she kept everything running so smoothly and everything went by without a glitch. The food and drink managers Mark and Amy did the most incredible job - nothing was ever too much, they were so attentive, and the chefs the most stunning meal after we gave them a fairly vague brief of 'curry'! We had the most perfect day and we're so incredibly grateful to Brinsop and the team."
V49,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,Brinsop Court is pure magic—an unforgettable venue with an incredible team!
V49,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We were lucky enough to have our wedding at Brinsop Court in December, and it was an absolutely spectacular day. We fell in love with Brinsop as soon we set our eyes on the beautiful manor and surrounding gardens. Cate, Amy, Mark and the rest of the wonderful staff at Brinsop really go the extra mile to make you feel special, and are extremely flexible with requests in order to make your day feel more special. We honestly felt like there was no request too big leading up to the day and they really made us feel extremely comfortable leading up to the day.
On the day, Cate and her team were well on hand to help us with setting up everything and she had everything under control when there were a few hiccups. The day itself was absolutely magical, and that wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for everyone at Brinsop working extremely hard to ensure that everything went to plan and as smoothly as it could.
Thank you to everyone at Brinsop for making us feel at ease and ensuring that our wedding was an amazing day."
V49,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Brinsop, the perfect wedding venue! We got married at Brinsop in December and I can honestly say it was everything we could have hoped for and more. We found out about the venue through Hitched and was one of only two venues that we visited but as soon as we got the house we knew it was the one. We fell in love with everything about it and it was fair to say that our guests agreed with us with many saying it was the nicest venue they’d been to. We had the wonderful Nina as our coordinator and she was brilliant! Nothing was too much trouble and we had constant communication with her in the build up which helped our stress levels no end. The same can be said for all of the staff who were brilliant throughout and allowed us to have the best day of our lives with everything running seamlessly. A special mention must be given to Amy and the catering staff who put on such an incredible menu (including the tasting session that provided some of the best food we’d ever had) and ensured that the food has been one of the main things that people have mentioned to us since the wedding! We had our ceremony in the Banqueting Hall which provided the perfect setting, especially with it being a winter wedding, as it really added to the cosy atmosphere and the lounge areas/games room were perfect for the drink’s reception. We would have loved to have also had it in the courtyard, but the temperatures meant that the lounge with the fireplace was a far more appealing option on the day. We then had the wedding breakfast and reception in the knot barn which was decorated beautifully and was the perfect place for the party in the evening. Overall we really can’t thank everyone at Brinsop enough for making our day what it was, we can honestly say that we have been made to feel part of the family and already can’t wait to hopefully come back to stay in one of the cottages for our first anniversary!"
V49,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Where do I start!!
Brinop Court is the most stunning venue, it was the first venue we visited and instantly fell in love! Theres so much history to the house and we were treated like family every time we visited before the wedding and it literally felt like home the whole weekend of the wedding, my guests also agreed!!

A special thank you to Issy our coodinator who went above and beyond ti make sure everything was perfect for us. It was so easy to plan and nothing was too much to ask, even arranging our dog to be our ring bearer!! When they say Brinsop is dog friendly they really mean it!!!

What a place, what a day!! Thank you so much everyone, you all made our day perfect and it really was the best day of our lives♥️"
V49,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We got married at the gorgeous Brinsop in October this year. It’s hard to put into words how amazing the whole experience was. We honestly had the best day of our lives!!!

We fell in love with Brinsop during our first visit back in December 2022. We knew almost immediately that Brinsop was the venue we were looking for! From the outside the venue looked like a painting - from the picturesque views of the countryside, to the swans swimming on the moat! The manor house itself has so much character, and has a lovely homely feel to it as you walk around it. Our guests were equally blown away by the venue!

A big thing for us was that it’s dog friendly, which meant we could have our two dogs join us on our special day, it wouldn’t have been the same without them there! They had so much fun walking around the grounds and greeting all of our guests!

Nina, our coordinator, and her team were always available to answer any of our questions in the run up to the day. This really put us at ease, knowing we were in safe hands. On the day, Nina and the team made sure everything ran smoothly and went above and beyond to ensure our guests were looked after. A shout out to Amy who heads up catering and Mark who manages the bar. The food and drinks were absolutely fantastic!

I highly recommend this venue! There’s a reason Brinsop is an award winning venue - and when you visit it’s not hard to see why. We are already looking forward to going back there for a date night next year! Thanks for everything Team Brinsop!

V50,The Manor at Bickley,"The Manor is the perfect venue for weddings! When our wedding venue fell through 4 months before the big day, I stumbled onto the Manor at Bickley and spoke to Craig. He was most helpful and kind and went above and beyond to make sure our wedding went ahead.

We hired the venue for our two day wedding and the staff were helpful and accommodating from start to finish. All of our guests were awed by the beautiful well kept grounds and the excellent service. We can’t thank the staff enough for making our wedding dreams a reality. They thought of every detail from bringing us champagne after our civil ceremony to making sure we had our card box at the end of the night! We are excited to head back to celebrate our anniversary there!"
V50,The Manor at Bickley,"Myself and my Husband chose this venue for our wedding last week and we can’t sing The Manor’s praises enough. From our very first enquiry, to the first viewing of the venue, right though until the big day, the staff at the manor have been nothing short of brilliant! Each staff member we came across was polite and accommodating. Special mention to Craig and Vicky with whom we did most of our liaising throughout the months leading up until our wedding. Craig and Vicky were super helpful, responsive and went above and beyond to make sure that we could have the day of our dreams. Even with last minute changes due to the weather, Craig who was just incredible throughout, managed to help us sort a backup plan so our day would still go ahead seamlessly.

The rooms at the manor were spacious and modern, giving us and our wedding party lots of space for photographers and videographers to capture the special moments on our wedding morning.

The lodge that was used for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready was fabulous. The manor was very flexible in giving us early access so we could get ready on time.

The grand marquee was definitely grand! Very spacious and when decorated looked like something out of a fairytale! lots of kitchen space, a huge bar and fantastic overhead speakers for the party!

The manor was super flexible to our needs regarding access, start times, outsourcing our vendors and much more. The venue is beautiful and spacious with options for outdoor and indoor events and entertainment. The grounds were absolutely beautiful, so many lovely spots for photos not only for us as the bride and groom but for guests too!

A very special thank you to our point of contact throughout, Craig. From our first meeting, he was charming, bubbly and made us feel super welcome. He reassured us that he has experience in African/Caribbean weddings and that our wedding day would amazing and it was. He was attentive and always let us know that he was only a phone call or e-mail away and was always quick to respond and answer any questions we had.

All in all, we had the most beautiful day at The manor and we would definitely recommend this venue for a wedding or other events.

V50,The Manor at Bickley,"We hired The Manor at Bickley for my daughters wedding. Got a brilliant service from the venue. Everything was set accordingly, as per floor plan. Our guests were loved the venue grounds/facilities and the overall wedding set up.
Thank you to everyone at Bickley."
V50,The Manor at Bickley,"A warm and friendly service from the very helpful staff, a feeling that it is your own house! The food was amazing and the atmosphere made us and our guests feel fantastic."
V51,Davenport House,We are so pleased we chose Davenport House for our wedding reception. Charley and the team were so helpful and thoughtful. Putting canapés behind the bar for us and making sure everything ran so smoothly. I am obsessed with the stunning house and grounds and it was absolutely perfect! Thank you so much for making our day so special!!
V51,Davenport House,"Davenport House is a STUNNING wedding venue so how could we not have it for our big day!?

The staff were exceptional! From the moment we booked through to our big day, we had an absolute blast and could not thank each member of staff enough! Special shout out to Jared (hopefully spelt right, haha!) who made sure we were fed, watered and ensured we took 5 minutes to ourselves every moment we could - Also even saved us slices of pie wedding cake before we went to bed!

Our guests have said they have never been to a wedding so spectacular, with the most amazing food and amazing staff so could not have been happier having Davenport as our venue! 🩷"
V51,Davenport House,"I just wanted to write to say a huge, enormous thank you to Charley and all the team at Davenport House. We still can’t believe how perfect our day was, and lots of our guests have told us it’s the best wedding they’ve ever been to. The team were all a huge part of making that happen. It was incredibly seamless and well planned on the day, meaning we genuinely didn’t have to think about a thing, except for enjoying ourselves. The day ran to schedule perfectly and even certain touches we didn’t know or expect to happen were planned by you and the team, which made the day even more special. Thank you so much for giving us our dream wedding day. We can’t wait to see the full set of pictures and the video now to relive it all!"
V51,Davenport House,"Without doubt the best day of our lives. From start to finish, Davenport has exceeded expectations. From the very first impression of the venue during the open day, the incredible food tasting evening, all the way through to the day itself, including the support and preparation leading up to it. It was really important to us to pick a venue that not only ticked the fairytale box, but also come with the complete support of a wedding planner, due to our busy jobs. We were lucky enough to have Charley as ours. She really took the time to listen and get to know us, to ensure the day was tailored to exactly what we wanted. We even had our own cocktail designed, which went down an absolute storm on the day! She considered every little detail, constantly putting our minds at ease, which made the whole process so easy and enjoyable. Honestly the day couldn’t have gone smoother, any anxiety or stress faded immediately as soon as we got to the venue. It was simply perfect. So many of our guests were complimentary of just how beautiful the venue is and just how well organised the day was, and that is the perfect way to summarise Davenport. Any prospective couples thinking of selecting Davenport as their venue, hesitate no further. It will be a day you never knew was possible! We cannot thank you enough Charley and the Davenport team, if only we could live the day over and over again"
V51,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was amazing. When looking for a venue we weren't just looking for something wow, we needed to have people who were enthused and passionate about their work - we found that at Davenport House.

From our first phone call & meeting with Lizzie and Tallulah, we knew this was the place for us. Having two brides wasn’t an issue; combining British, Asian and Spanish cultures - wasn't an issue; having brides enter together – wasn’t an issue. Nothing was an issue. At Davenport House, we got it all – a picturesque venue and the best team of staff anyone could ever wish for. All our external suppliers have commented what a fantastic venue you are. All out guests have said that the service and attention to detail was second to none. The thoughtful touches like hiring a Spanish speaking waiter for the table which spoke very little English ensured that everyone felt welcomed. Guests with dietary requirements didn't feel they got a second rate meal or they were an afterthought - the food for all throughout the day was exceptional. The rooms / cottages where our guests and we stayed, spotless and comfortable. The thought behind adding some cheese and Spanish ham to the morning breakfast - so sweet!

Special shout out to Megan - wedding planner extraordinaire who kept in touch throughout the planning process and was exceptional on the day. Ian who worked tirelessly to ensure the day ran smoothly and the food was perfect, Charley who was also in charge of one bride and ensuring that everything was on point. All the staff were fantastic - polite, professional and personal.

Everyone keeps saying that this was the best wedding they have ever attended and that’s a lot of weddings between people! When we asked why, they say things like ‘the venue’, ‘the staff’, but it all came back to the inclusivity, love & joy that they felt – and you were all a part of that.

Davenport House is a stunning venue made even better by those who work there. If you want the whole package on your wedding day, we strongly recommend you book them.

Thank you to the entire Davenport House team.

Sat and Ana xx"
V51,Davenport House,"Where to begin with our beautiful venue and thanking the people who made it all happen! We got married in November at Davenport House and it was easily the best day of our lives. We chose Davenport because we wanted to host our cosy winter wedding in a big grand house in the country, with all the grandeur and class but to still feel like an intimate celebration with our family and closest friends, and it was perfect in delivering just that. It is utterly beautiful, the location was perfect and exactly what we wanted. The food was absolutely AMAZING, we had so many compliments from our guests and we are so grateful for the team in delivering such a fabulous wedding breakfast. Thank you so much to Lizzie who couldn’t do more to help us have our dream day, and Ian who delivered the best service to us and our guests (the pizza at 2am was very much appreciated)

Massive massive thank you to Charley our wedding planner, who was so so helpful throughout our wedding planning process and on the day, I can’t thank her enough. She was always there whenever I needed her, helped me so much with creating our dream day and I will be forever grateful to her for keeping me sane! Whenever I had any worries I knew she was just a phone call away, which helped me a lot when planning a wedding!

Charley, Lizzie and Ian thank you for everything - best team ever. Our day was seamless and it was all down to you and your incredible team.

Jess and Sam xx"
V51,Davenport House,"Me and my (now) wife chose Davenport House as our wedding venue in mid 2022, to get married in September 2023, and it was the best decision we could have made. We looked at a range of Georgian style manor house type venues located in Cheshire, North Wales and the West Midlands areas. It blew all of the competition away in terms of the venue aesthetics, the balance in design (i.e. period characteristics vs modern design), the impressive condition of the property for its age plus what it offered for our wedding weekend.

Staff and service - In the UK, this is usually something that is average at best - if you're lucky. At Davenport House, the service from all staff was 10/10. I honestly don't think we've ever had better service for anything. We had a wedding planner from the start (Megan), who was an absolute saint and was fundamental in making the whole wedding a success. She was also instrumental in helping us find a way for our 'little' dog Bernie to be a part of the main event. Thanks Megan!

Accommodation - The fantastic condition, design and decor for Davenport House extends to all areas of the estate. The rooms are fantastic, very big, well maintained and cleaned religiously by the venue. We had no issues or problems from all of the guests who stayed onsite over the 3 days.

Food and drink - This got a lot of deserved praise from the guests too. We got to tailor our entire menu and it worked perfectly for what we wanted for the 3 days. The oyster bar and luxurious charcuterie board went down particularly well the day before the wedding.

I could keep writing much, much more on how fantastic this venue was for our wedding. But the best advice I could give for any interested couples is to go and visit it in person and reach out to Davenport House with any questions. Our own wedding ended up becoming both perfect and the best wedding we've ever been to. Thanks guys again!"
V51,Davenport House,"Fantastic location.
Great staff.
Beautiful place to get married.
I can wait to film here again soon thanks for having me."
V51,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was a fairytale, everything we could have dreamed of and more. Lizzie and Charley were fantastic in their support, organisation and professionalism in planning our wedding. The venue is simply spectacular- breathtaking. Our guests were blown away. The day ran so smoothly it was simply perfect. The food was out of this world our guests couldn't get enough. All the staff at the house went above and beyond to ensure we were happy and having a great day. The team were also extremely supportive of last minute changes/additions. The Davenport experience was truly wonderful and I'm sad to see it end right from our initial meetings, food tasting and finally our special day. Thank you: Lizzie, Charley, Ian and all of the team for a truly memorable day for us and our guests. Mr and Mrs Kissane"
V51,Davenport House,"We got married at Davenport House in February and they provided us with the most perfect day. Lizzie, Charley, Ian and the rest of the team were the best hosts we could have hoped for. Nothing was too much to ask and the guests all commented on the hospitality shown to them. The setting is utterly gorgeous, our weather was less than favourable so we did not make the most of the grounds but this didn't matter, the house was setting enough and so atmospheric! The food was utterly AMAZING and better than most restaurant food I have eaten. The venue feels intimate and grand at the same time.
I literally cannot recommend this place enough, they gave us the wedding we had always wanted and more!"

V53,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge on 12 May 2023 and it was incredible. The views are gorgeous and the photo opportunities are endless with beautiful floral and green surroundings. The team were super responsive throughout the process which is really reassuring and helpful when planning a wedding, and Nelson who ran the day was just fantastic. Every single detail was thought of and they run a really slick operation. This is essential as it meant I had a lot less to think about! They put me and my partner at ease throughout. The food and service on the day was fantastic, so many of our guests said this was the best food they’ve ever had at a wedding. Highly recommend! (Photos by Costa Weddings UK)"
V53,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","Pembroke where super helpful and provided a lot of guidance in helpful forms and layouts. Always available for a call and very helpful. on the day, it ran super smooth and and staff where lovely. Thank yo for making it a great day!"
V53,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge in October 2024. The whole day was magical, including the beautiful view over the autumn trees in Richmond Park. Robert made sure everything ran perfectly and helped us to find slots in the busy wedding timetable to fit in some special moments to also reflect traditions from my husband's Dutch culture. The food was great and the staff were polite and fun. All preparation with Lucy was also smooth and done with a smile. The Pembroke Lodge team ooze experience but make every wedding feel special and really listen to your wishes for the day. Highly recommend! Thank you to the whole Pembroke Lodge team, especially Robert, Lucy, the kitchen team and the staff on the day!"
V53,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park",The staff has been very helpful. They have a lot of experience. Open to any suggestions and help in critical situations.
V53,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue than Pembroke Lodge for our summer wedding. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most gorgeous backdrop for our special day. A huge thank you to our banqueting manager, Nelson, who went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly.

The team was incredibly supportive and accommodating throughout the planning process, making it an enjoyable and stress-free experience. Their professionalism and attention to detail made all the difference, and we’re so grateful for everything they did to make our day unforgettable. Highly recommend!"
V53,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We got married on the 3rd of October this year, and the team made our day magical! What a smooth day. We loved every second of it! The guests loved everything, and raved about the food and organisation.
Hiring Pembroke Lodge was easy. We had a viewing where all information was shared in detail and super clear to understand and make a decision.
On the months leading up to the big day our contact was Alice. Alice is a star. Responsive, professional, and had answers and solutions to everything.
On the day, Nelson coordinated the whole thing, minute by minute, and we are forever grateful for his politeness, professionalism and high spirits. We felt safe and in good hands. I would give Pembroke Lodge way over 5 stars if I could :)"
V53,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","My wedding went without a hitch, thanks to the amazing team at Pembroke Lodge (special thanks to Nicola & Robert)! They made sure everything was set up perfectly on the day, exactly in the way we had requested, and then ensured the day itself went as smoothly as we could've hoped. Everything looked beautiful and the stunning views made all of our guests fall in love with the venue too."
V53,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had the most perfect day. The team have all been so responsive and accommodating of our every request. The venue is beautiful and we were lucky to have gorgeous sunset views. It is truly a countryside wedding but conveniently close to London, which was important for our overseas guests. The food was fantastic and staff were professional and efficient. Would recommend to anyone."
V53,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We recently had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge, and I cannot say enough good things about the venue, the team and manager, Robert. From the moment we started planning to the big day itself, he was absolutely incredible.

Robert went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. He was always available to answer our questions, offer solutions, and provide creative suggestions that enhanced our vision. He coordinated effortlessly with our vendors, making sure everyone was on the same page, which took so much stress off our shoulders.

On the day of the wedding, he was a true rockstar! He made sure the timeline flowed perfectly, from setting up the ceremony space to ensuring the reception transitions were seamless. His dedication and hands-on approach allowed us to enjoy every moment without worrying about a single thing.

Our wedding was a dream come true, and we owe so much of that to him and the team! Thank you, for everything you all did to make our day magical."
V53,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We could not have wished for a better wedding venue for our special day! Everyone went above and beyond to make sure our day goes perfectly without us having to worry about a single thing! A big shoutout to Nelson who was absolutely brilliant and made the day feel so calm and well thought through.

The food was delicious and all the team was so welcoming and super helpful on the day.

Thank you so much, we really really appreciate all the help!"
V54,The Hackney,"If you are having a wedding for under 60 people then this is your place! From start to finish the communication and planning of the wedding was seamless and took so much of the stress out of the day. The totally customisable packages that they offer really does suit anyone’s budget and more importantly regardless of what package you end up going for it is value for money. The food was delicious and it catered to everyone’s tastes including a pregnant guest, halal, vegan and lactose intolerant and was the talking point for our guests. The venue itself is stunning! Lots of exposed brick, they had recently redecorated before our wedding and the reception room that doubled up as the dance floor was styled simply but made a statement and the outdoor covered patio area was a welcome addition. The team understood our vision from the get go and they completely nailed it, all of our guests couldn’t believe it was here! I honestly can’t recommend it enough if you’re wanting a small and intimate wedding venue but still with all the class. I would say to future couples even if you think this wouldn’t be your venue please please do have a proper look because it will change your mind, I had come across this venue multiple times over the course of a year and decided to take a leap of faith and give it a chance and we’re so happy we did."
V54,The Hackney,"We can’t recommend the Hackney highly enough. They made the whole process so easy and they offer so much in-house which we took advantage of. The food was especially great - our guests were amazed “best food I’ve ever had at a wedding” and the team took great care of us during the planning stages.

They offer a very customisable service with scalable pricing. If you’re having a fairly small wedding (under 60) then you must check out The Hackney.

We had such a perfect day and we owe so much of that to the fabulous venue. Beautiful space, so professionally run."
V54,The Hackney,"We had such a brilliant experience working with the team at The Hackney. We were regularly in touch throughout the planning process and the use of the shared spreadsheet was especially handy for keeping everyone informed.
We had to postpone our wedding two days before as we were both sick with COVID, and the team were just fantastic. They waited for us to recover and then we started to talk through options again. We were able to rebook just six months after our original date, and the team were accomodating and understanding throughout the process.
The day itself was perfect. Lots of our guests commented on the quality and quantity of the food and Hugo was great at keeping everything to time. We wish we could do it all again."
V54,The Hackney,"We had our wedding reception here and wow was it amazing. Hugo, Erika and the whole team were amazing. Every single guest commented on how delicious and plentiful the food was. The staff were amazing nothing was too much to ask and all so happy.
The venue itself was decorated amazingly, given we left our wedding stationary etc up to the venue it exceeded our expectations. I was concerned about the allowed decibel level for Dj / entertainment but it was plenty loud enough. I wish I could relive the day again, if you’re thinking about booking The Hackney do it! You will not regret!"
V54,The Hackney,"We held our wedding reception at The Hackney in July and it was truly the best experience. We opted for a standing reception for our 65 guests, serving food bowl-style for a more relaxed, less formal feel. The food was absolutely delicious and there was lots of it - it just kept coming! Our guests are still raving about how good the food was months later! Lots of good drinks options too - we especially like the cocktails here!

The staff on the night were so friendly, welcoming and were amazing with our children guests too!

The Hackney is such an aesthetic venue with exposed brick walls and existing foliage which we loved, so we kept additional decorations to a minimum. We dropped our decorations to The Hackney the day before and picked them up the day after, which was super easy! We hadn’t given them too much direction with where we wanted everything placed but when we turned up to the venue on the day it was truly perfect! The staff know exactly what they’re doing and had decorated it beautifully! The outdoor seating area is a great feature too (especially for our two greyhounds who chilled out there for the majority of the reception!)

We opted for a simple Spotify playlist for our music and their sound system was good.

The wedding planning process was super easy from start to finish, with continued support and check-ins from Hugo, from the moment we booked, to the day itself! We really enjoyed the menu tasting experience earlier in the year too, which is a great touch in the build up to the big day! The planning spreadsheet was easy to use and made us feel content and relaxed, knowing that everything was under control.

Overall, we would highly recommend The Hackney to anyone looking for an affordable, dog-friendly, wedding reception venue with a laidback vibe, delicious food and lovely friendly staff! We look forward to coming back every year to celebrate our anniversary, with an espresso martini!"
V54,The Hackney,"We hosted our wedding reception with the team at the hackney in May 2023. The planning experience was straight forward and easy to book. The availability for the venue is on the website so easy to see when they have and get it booked. We went with the 5 canapés, bowl food menu, and drinks on arrival with wine through the event. The staff were brilliant and food delicious.

We loved the vibe of the venue as we wanted a bit more of a casual event, with a relaxed feel and we were able to host our 85 guests with no issues (although limited to standing event at this size, there is enough scattered seating for anyone to sit when they wanted).

In terms of decorating, we didn't feel the need to add any extra flowers as the venue was already so made up with plants and other decorations.

We did add the photo box which I highly recommend, was great fun for our friends and family and came with a memory book. People were shy at first but really got into it. We also used the recommended baker who provided a delicious cake.

Final area to mention - pricing. Wedding venues can be really expensive and daunting before you even start paying for any food or drink. Something that really attracted us to this venue was the low spacing cost and the minimum spend with it. It meant that we were able to completely customise the experience and see where the money we were spending was going. There are many different options and packages to go with, so it's up to you.

Only thing that wasn't offered was any tasting of the food beforehand which we would've liked to have done but none the less, the food was delicious so it wasn't really needed!

To finish, we loved every moment of it and hope that many others get to experience the same. Thank you very much team at the hackney!"
V54,The Hackney,"We had our reception in July. The venue was cosy and comfortably fit 30 people without feeling too crowded or too empty (we were worried it might be too empty). We managed to fit a band in, arranged mini-golf in the venue after dinner, and customize the cocktail menu with custom recipe (that we provided before hand).

One of the biggest highlights was the food. The crispy roast pork got so many complements and indeed it was tasty. But really, all the dishes were amazing (we had a tasting session prior), it was hard to choose, but the taste of each dish was still top notch on the day itself too. I heard that the supper snacks we ordered were great too but alas, I was too busy and they were snapped up instantly!

Some other details:
* We were allowed to use the small room downstairs as a private space to put our stuff. Very handy to not mess up items.
* We went with a bar tab and kept increasing the budget each time till the end of the night instead of the all-you-can-drink. From our rough calculations, it worked out about the same going for all-you-can-drink. Of course, certain folk were heavy weights and more than made it up will be different for each crowd.
* Lighting for photos came out excellent (combination of photographer and venue lighting).
* You can adjust air conditioning to suit the weather (we had ours on the warm side due to older folk not dealing with cold too well).
* Outdoor space was a pleasant change in atmosphere for those who wanted some fresh air.

What about the review from the Bride? Bride approved this review."
V54,The Hackney,"The day was fabulous - Hugo was brilliant and flexible with what we were after. The tasting day before was such a great idea and the whole experience and guidance given made planning a wedding in c.5 months so much easier. We had vegans, last minute drop outs, ridiculously hot weather, about 3 different spotify playlists, a string quartet, florists arriving in the morning and a cake that arrived the day before - the team took it all in their stride and it seemed like a breeze. Loved it all and we've had such good feedback from guests. A fabulous whirlwind.

Two very minor points for feedback - we maxed out the guest numbers (the team did advise us against it but were very accommodating despite us also throwing musicians into the mix) and it was a little too crowded pre-lunch on such a hot day. We also put some speeches in between courses (again, we were recommended against it) and that may have been a slight mistake for the dessert timings, as the tasting day was 10/10. But, it was a perfect day in a stunning venue. Loved it - thank you guys."
V54,The Hackney,"Jon and the team were absolute superstars, hosting the perfect wedding day for us. The space is beautiful, the decor is modern and perfect. They were so accommodating for any request or question we had which we really appreciated. Guests commented on how great the cocktails were! The day ran so smoothly and we had a fantastic time."
V54,The Hackney,"From the initial phonecall to the warm welcome we got when we first visited The Hackney, we knew we were in safe hands and that we’d made the perfect choice. The venue offers the most beautiful interiors - the perfect mix of cosy, intimate and modern industrial - exactly what we were looking for!

Our entire experience with The Hackney was an absolute dream -we loved the mega organised approach to planning. Something that could have been incredibly intimidating was made so straightforward with the amazing support of Hugo the General Manager who embraced all our weird and wonderful suggestions and gave expert advice on what we could do to make things even better. We left every meeting buzzing with ideas and even more excited to welcome our closest friends and family to the big day.

The quality of the food and drinks is impeccable - every single one of our guests (even the fussiest!) has commented on how much they loved it. We absolutely loved the menu tasting, even though it made the decision even harder as everything was amazing. What makes it even better for us is living close by and being able to pop into our wedding venue for a coffee or a cocktail!

I couldn't recommend The Hackney enough - I just wish we could go back and do it all again!"
V55,PYRÁ,"We held our wedding reception at Pyra. We booked the entire venue, with the upstairs loft serving as a dance floor with bar and downstairs having tables and seating for guests.  Canapes were served upstairs and a buffet dinner was served downstairs.  We lucked out with great April weather, so guests were also able to enjoy Pyra’s patio and additional space on Lonsdale Road. We were very happy with our decision to have our reception at Pyra, and many of our guests commented on how lovely the space was, how nice the staff were, and how delicious the food was.
 
The venue:
The space is gorgeous with lots of natural light upstairs.  Guests arrived at 4pm but we had the venue for the entire day, and Pyra gave our florist access earlier to set up beautiful flower arrangements and candles - it looked stunning.  Pyra set up our welcome sign and card box too. The venue also accepted delivery of our cake on the morning of the wedding which was a huge help, set it up very nicely upstairs, and cut it for us after the formal “cake cutting” shots.  We were able to coordinate with Pyra ahead of time to arrange the space how we wanted, such as how many tables we wanted downstairs and the set-up of the loft upstairs.  They even had a microphone ready for us upstairs so we could say a few words to our guests before our cake cutting. Perfect! For the evening dancing, we were able to set the disco lighting to our colour scheme, which worked really well with candles and foliage (latter 2 provided by our florist).
 
The food:
The buffet dinner was fantastic.  Pyra gave us multiple menu items to choose from and we were able to fix a nice menu that took into account guests’ dietary restrictions.  We initially booked the venue when it had a different chef and menu.  We came in a few months before our wedding to try the new menu – our dinner was delicious then and there was no dip in quality for the buffet-style served at our reception. Fionn worked with us how to plan best - because we wanted a relaxed style with a dance floor upstairs, we ended up feeding our 80 guests in two sittings downstairs, which worked perfectly. The upstairs space can seat 60 people, which didn’t work for how we planned our event, but does look really nice in photos. The late night food served around 10pm also went down very well.
 
The staff:
The staff, including the bartenders and waiters, were hardworking, friendly and very nice to guests.  Enough staff were around that guests never had to wait long for drinks.  Members of staff cut our cake for us and also boxed up the late night food for guests to bring home.  Fionn, the day-of coordinator, was on-site for our entire reception and was very helpful, even helping coordinate our midnight bus arrival.
 
Responsiveness:
Overall we were happy with the responsiveness of the venue.  It took a little while to nail down the final details of the food menu and drinks menu/bar tab but we were ultimately very happy with the result.  As the venue hosts more weddings/ larger-scale events we’d expect this will improve.

Overall:
We highly recommend Pyra for a wedding reception. We had 80 guests in total, which worked very well for the canapes/cocktail hour upstairs (4-6pm), sit-down buffet downstairs (6-8pm, split into two seatings) and dancing upstairs (8pm-midnight).  The upstairs loft was able to fit all 80 guests plus a four-piece band.  Lonsdale Road is also a charming street that provided great photo opportunities.  We looked into several other venues, and came away happy with Pyra's quote – we were able to book the venue, food (including canapes, dinner and late night food) and a generous bar tab for roughly the amount some other London venues were charging for just their space (no food or drink included). We and our guests had a fantastic time. Thanks so much to Fionn and the Pyra team :)"
V55,PYRÁ,"We had our wedding celebration at Lula. We booked the loft and restaurant for this.

Positives:
The venue is beautiful and needs minimal decoration.
The food was amazing; the chef is truly professional and everyone loved it.
They redecorated the restaurant section and added a set of couches to make it a lounge, which was beautiful.
The staff was very hardworking, professional, and lovely.

They provided us with a lounge, a wedding breakfast space and a dance floor.

Flexibility with Cake:
The bakery was scheduled to deliver and set up the cake at 16:45, but they delivered it at 09:45 instead. The Lula team handled the situation professionally by storing the cake and setting it up at the correct time. They presented the cake beautifully and assisted in cutting it into nice pieces. It could not have been more perfect.


The list of available drinks was huge, and they were happy to make custom drinks and bring in different juices if requested in advance. The event manager tried to accommodate every wish we had, and on the day we could not have hoped for more. Most of our guests said it was one of the best weddings and most beautiful venues they had ever been to.

Negatives:
Food tasting for the wedding menu was not included, which we had assumed would be, but it was given at a 50% discount. We had to sort out the floral decoration last minute, as they had initially suggested they would arrange it for us after providing a budget, but later said we needed to find our own. At times, they were a bit slow to respond, which made us anxious, but after communicating with them, this was resolved, and communication was very swift.

In conclusion:
Lula gave us the most beautiful wedding we could have dreamt of. We highly recommend them. The venue, the food, the service were amazing, and we could not have hoped for more."
V56,Sandon Manor,"We had such a special wedding at Sandon Manor, the team made every effort to make our day so so special and we will be forever grateful for that. A dream team! The day ran so smoothly and they worked so hard. The venue is unique with lots of different spaces which unfold throughout the day, which was perfect as our wedding fell on a wet and windy autumnal day. We would highly recommend Sandon Manor!"
V56,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor provided the perfect venue for our wedding. From the initial conversations and meetings with the team, we knew we were in safe hands and had made the right choice. They kept us informed with any events, made information a bit payments clear and reassured us with any query we had.
The accommodation was exceptional and fitted our requirements perfectly, with high quality finishing touches throughout to ensure our stay was as comfortable as possible.
The wedding venue was incredible! Our ceremony took place in the gorgeously modern barn with stunning draping and greenery. Following on, we had a blissful drinks reception which was on the expertly manicured lawn (with mini golf!) and sun-trap of a courtyard. We then moved onto our wedding breakfast which was held in the main barn, seating all of our guests comfortably with space for decor and extra details. Following from dinner, the part started and the club room came to life! This was absolutely the talking point of the day and our guests raved about how incredible it was! It managed to create a club-like atmosphere, whilst maintaining the vibe, albeit at a reduced volume, in the rest of the barn. The layout of the venue was important to us, as it ensured our guests never strayed too far, to keep the momentum of the day.
The team at Sandon worked superbly with all of vendors which ensured the day ran smoothly from set up to clearing. All of our vendors commented on how much they too loved working there.
The venue, the aesthetics, the staff, everything was perfect! We would absolutely recommend to anyone getting married."
V56,Sandon Manor,"We cannot recommend Sandon Manor enough. From the quality of the service, the helpfulness and friendliness of the team, the beautiful accommodation and the most amazing venue which all or guests loved partying the night away in. To make it even more special the Manor is in amazing grounds in beautiful countryside and nature reserves.
Sandon Manor made our dream come true."
V56,Sandon Manor,"I couldn't recommend Sandon Manor highly enough - from our first enquiry to our Wedding, nothing was too much trouble. The team are so friendly and easy to communicate with, very approachable and responsive. They respond to any questions immediately and having the day before to set up with Tom was fantastic. Styaying in the Manor House and Dovecote was the icing on the cake as to be with friends and family the night before and the day after was so fabulous. On the day Tom and the team were absolutely fantastic and couldn't have done more to make our special day. We couldn't have dreamt of anywhere more perfect than Sandon Manor - a huge thank you to all the staff."
V56,Sandon Manor,"If you are considering Sandon Manor for your wedding venue, I beg you: scratch it off your list now. Yes, the house and grounds are beautiful, but the people behind it are absolutely awful. They ruined our wedding experience.

I will get straight to it. Sandon Manor has a very strict policy on guests leaving the site by 11:30pm (and no one is allowed back to the Manor unless they’re official guests staying overnight). We had lots of international guests at our wedding. Many hadn’t seen each other in years and would be jetlagged - we thought they may be keen to continue chatting after 11:30pm. With this in mind, we made a booking with Sandon Village Hall via our contacts at the church (where we were attending services and later married). They granted us access to the village hall until 1am as a contingency spill over space.

We mentioned this in passing during our online meeting with one of the Sandon Manor team a month before our wedding. Within hours, I received a voicemail from the lady in charge of Village Hall bookings saying (quote) “someone at Sandon Manor is trying to throw a spanner into the works for you”. It soon transpired that they had raised an official complaint to the parish council and pressurised the village hall team into cancelling our booking. To be clear, Sandon village Hall and Sandon Manor are entirely separate entities – there is no crossover between them whatsoever, as the owner of Sandon Manor later acknowledged.

It gets worse. Gob smacked, we asked Kate – the owner of Sandon Manor – for a call to find out what was going on. She was abhorrent, trying to justify her meddling as a necessary measure to protect her wedding license (side note: with Sandon Manor it is always about the money – once your deposit is paid they care nothing for your ‘special day’; you are just another cash cow). Did she apologise for stabbing us, her clients, in the back? No, she did not. She could not even fathom how hurt we were by being completely bypassed in the communication chain and how deceitful and disrespectful this was. My husband and I were quite literally left speechless. We’ve never experienced this sort of treatment from anyone, let alone our wedding venue - to whom we were paying many thousands of pounds. Dealing with this stress in the final month of wedding prep really took its toll on us and soured things. We no longer looked forward to our day, rather dreaded what Sandon Manor might do next.

Aside from this major incident, there were many other occasions when Sandon Manor were unhelpful and unfeeling in their interactions with us:

- We enquired if it would be possible to arrange a large pizza takeaway order instead of using Sandon Manor’s caterer for our late night food. One of the team explained on a call that this wasn’t contractually possible; we acknowledged this. We then received an email saying ‘If you are unable to follow this or any other of our T&C's we would be happy to cancel your booking.’ This was less than a month before our wedding.
- We had a harpist perform in the church. We were told she wasn’t allowed to play during our drinks reception in the grounds due to potential noise complaints (an acoustic harp at 2pm in the afternoon). No other music was permitted outside the house.
- Sandon Manor is an incredibly expensive (in hindsight, grossly overpriced) venue. But we were also hit with hidden fees when booking their accommodation option - an extra £425 ‘cleaning fee’ was added to our bill.
- At the time of booking, Sandon was running a promotion waivering the £700 fee for hiring their ceremony space. As we were marrying at the church, we asked if it would please be possible to put this towards other elements of our day i.e. using their festoon string of lights in the barn (for which they charge £450). They refused.
- We were unsure about booking the 1-bed Dovecote on the grounds as - at £499 for the weekend - it was a considerable expense. While we were deciding Sandon Manor rented it out on Air BnB (to one of our guests, which made for a very awkward conversation).

To summarise, you only get one wedding day. Kate and her team absolutely ruined ours. There are so many other lovely venues in north Hertfordshire run by decent, humane people. Please prioritise your happiness and choose wisely. I wish we had."
V56,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor is a stunning wedding venue with a great team behind it. The exclusive use of the manor for the weekend was a highlight, allowing us to relax with friends and family in the lead up to and after the big day. The Sandon team were brilliant, guiding us through the planning process and ensuring everything ran smoothly on the day. We couldn't have asked for a better place and team to help us celebrate our big day."
V56,Sandon Manor,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our special day. Holly, Tom and the rest of the brilliant team made us feel welcome from day one. Special mention to Tom for making the day run so seamlessly, so professional and accommodating of all our needs.

The venue itself is stunning, located in the beautiful Hertfordshire countryside. The Manor House makes for a tremendous location to prepare, and the Dovecote suite is a nice touch: a great addition for the groom to spend the last night. We loved the small details of the characteristic main venue, with the botanical feel to the bar a great backdrop to the barn.

It’s a shame we can’t stay every week!

Dan & Suzanne"
V56,Sandon Manor,"To Holly, Louise, Tom & Kate, wow, what can we say but the biggest thank you for the best day of our lives! When we viewed the beautiful venue over two years ago we just knew instantly Sandon Manor was the one, not just because it’s stunning, but you guys are amazing! Thank you for making all our wedding dreams come true. Forever grateful and can’t wait to return to reminisce. Lots of love, the new Mr & Mrs Jakes xxx"
V56,Sandon Manor,"From the moment we visited Sandon Manor we knew this would be our wedding venue for 9 September 2023. Seeing the spectacular finish of the house carry through to the completed venue just shows the high level of attention to detail this venue had to offer.

Holly, Tom and the rest of the team filled us with confidence right from our first interactions, annd went above and beyond on the wedding weekend itself to facilitate us, our suppliers and guests. The main house, dovecote, annex and extensive grounds were a wonderful way to have close family stay with us on site, and so handy to be able to all get ready nearby the morning of.

Thank you for making our wedding weekend a truly memorable occasion, for us and our families. We all look back on this day with the happiest, sunniest memories and Sandon Manor will always have a very special place in our hearts."
V56,Sandon Manor,"We had the most amazing wedding weekend at Sandon Manor.

The venue itself is the perfect backdrop for a wedding, our photos looked amazing from every single angle. There were so many spaces to make use of throughout the day which helped things to run incredibly smoothly and meant we didn’t need to have a ‘turnaround’ during the evening. The spaces really wowed our guests and created such a lovely atmosphere. Including the ‘club room’ dance floor that had our guests dancing until the very last song!

We stayed at the Manor House for the weekend, extending our wedding into a perfect weekend retreat. The house itself is beautiful, with lots of different areas for everyone to relax, and the perfect peaceful location to chill the night before the big day!

From our first viewing to checking out the day after our wedding, the Sandon staff were attentive, friendly and helped us feel relaxed and looked after throughout an otherwise overwhelming process. We’d highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for a beautiful, peaceful and unique wedding venue!"
V57,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Thank you so much to the entire team for making our wedding so special! Thanks to Donique, MJ, Mo, Harry and everyone else for helping us organise our day and for their professional but friendly attitude. Merchant Taylors is such a beautiful venue and offers a brilliant layout and different spaces to make the day so special!"
V57,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you all so very much for such an amazing wedding on Saturday. You all worked tirelessly to make it so special. Everything was truly wonderful and you all did me proud! Both Hugh and I couldn’t have asked for anything more in terms of being so well looked after. Our guests were so impressed and have given us so many compliments on a brilliantly well run event. Thank you all again for playing a brilliant part in our truly wonderful day of which we loved every minute
V57,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you so much for the most wonderful wedding reception at the end of April. We had the perfect day and our guests all commented on how well looked after they has been. Thank you again for all your hard work!
V57,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"We know this is very late (we have no excuse), but we wanted to say thank you for everything you and the team at Merchant Taylor's did for us on our wedding day. All the guests have since told us how much they loved the venue, food and service. Fingers crossed you get a few couples getting in touch! Again, Thank You for everything!"
V57,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"My brother and I attended the wedding today, as Florist's for the wedding party.
We were treated fantastically well by ALL the staff that we met, nothing was too much trouble and they made our task a COMPLETE pleasure.
If this is how they treat the actual wedding party then you will have a unforgettable time. Many thanks to all the staff for helping us to do our job with ease ."
V57,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Zara,

Can we thank you and your team at Merchant Taylor’s Hall for all your hard work in making Caroline and Neil’s recent wedding so very special. You, in particular, were able to deal with every question and request in a really professional manner.

Merchant Taylors’ Hall is part of the rich panoply of history and tradition, which makes this great City. All of our guests, and in particular those from abroad, were totally spell bound by the atmosphere, the food and service.

James was superb in organising the whole operation. To turn the Great Hall from a wedding ceremony hall to a banqueting suite for 110 guests, including flowers, place settings and dance floor in ninety minutes was truly remarkable.

The food and wine was of an amazing standard, we know that Merchant Taylors’ Hall has a reputation for presenting some of the finest dining in the City of London. You certainly surpassed all expectations.

We have many wonderful memories of the 10th September 2016, but it is best summed up by our daughter Caroline, “Can we do it all over again?”."
V58,Garden Museum,I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate everything that you did to make our party such a success last Friday. It was brilliant being outside on such a lovely everning. Everyone was very impressed with the venue.
V58,Garden Museum,"Thank you for all your help, advice and on-the-day support, it really made our wedding very special and it certianly went off without a hitch! The Museum looked amazing and the garden was perfect, especially as the sunshine adn the guests wanted to make the most of the beautiful surroundings."
V59,Clearwell Castle,"Can’t tell you how wonderful the team were at Clearwell. Our wedding coordinator Phaedra was exceptional. Attention to detail and everyone of the team from front of house, waiting staff, groundsmen and the DJ made our day absolutely everything we dreamed of and unique to us.

Can’t recommend highly enough and cost was outstanding value for money.

So many our guest commented on the quality of the food and that it was the best wedding they had been too! The children loved the magic of the castle and opportunity to get outside and see the grounds.

The grooms family had a fabulous time staying in the cottages the night before and our guests at both the Castle & the Wyndham had a fabulous stay on the night of the wedding.

Wish we could do it all again!"
V59,Clearwell Castle,We had our wedding at Clearwell in June and we couldn’t recommend it highly enough. From start to finish everything was perfect and they went above and beyond to ensure we had an amazing day. I’d not hesitate in recommending them to any couples. Just a gorgeous place with staff that really care in making your day all that you hope it will be.
V59,Clearwell Castle,"From the moment we first visited Clearwell, we knew this was the venue for us. From the moment we started planning to the final touches on the day, all the staff were fantastic. Ann, our wedding coordinator, was a delight to work with throughout. Nothing was too much trouble and she kept us updated throughout. The day was tailored exactly to our needs and when we arrived at the venue on the day they had prepared everything perfectly.

We did the night before package which included rooms and food the evening before. We were supplied with so much food no one went hungry. The rooms in the Wyndham and the Castle are fantastically appointed.

The venue itself is gorgeous. The cellar bar downstairs adds a whole different dimension to the occasion where you can really let your hair down.

This was an absolute dream come true venue for us. We loved every single minute."
V59,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot fault this venue at all. We initially had to change our wedding date because of lockdown and they were so supportive and empathetic.
Ann, our coordinator, is quite possibly the loveliest person on the planet. She was always happy to answer any questions and it never felt like we were being a nuisances or asking a silly question.
On the morning of the wedding she was a lovely calm presence and the whole day just ran like clockwork.
The food was out of this world with many guests saying it was the best food they’d had at a wedding and one person actually thought we’d hired a Michellin Chef!
The venue is so so beautiful with plenty of space. The downstairs cellar was a great place to party the night away, it was like an exclusive nightclub. There were lots of quieter rooms for people who wanted some peace.
The DJ was brilliant, we forgot to give a list of songs we liked but he did a great job of guessing what we liked ( he must’ve looked at our age and figured nineties dance music was our era. And he was bang on the money)
I do not have a single complaint about this venue"
V59,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot speak highly enough about Clearwell Castle as a wedding venue. The venue itself is absolutely stunning. It rained on our wedding day but the indoor space was so vast and beautiful that ourselves and our guests still had the most amazing time! Our wedding co-ordinator, Phaedra, was absolutely incredible, both before and during the wedding. She was always so professional, replied to all of my emails (there were many) and answered all queries efficiently. On the day, we genuinely could not have managed without her. The day flowed so well with her guidance and it really helped me as the Bride as I felt I didn't need to worry about anything! All the other staff at Clearwell and at the Wyndham hotel were also so wonderful! Everyone worked so hard and every member of staff was so kind to us; it just made our day incredibly special and we are so appreciative to them all. The food was great, service very quick and all the guests really enjoyed it! We had so many compliments about the staff and venue! I honestly could not recommend Clearwell castle more as a wedding venue!"
V59,Clearwell Castle,"Our wedding on 10/11/23 was just the absolute perfect day from start to finish. Our wedding planner manager, Hannah, was incredible, not just on the day but throughout the whole planning process. She ensured everything ran smoothly on the day, sparing no details ensuring everything was just perfect and to time but without being stressful. She was very accommodating with the planning meetings working around both mine and my now Husband's shift patterns.
We both stayed the night before our wedding and the night of the wedding with many of our guests travelling a distance so also staying in the Wyndham which was very convenient. Staying in Keepers cottage with the Bridesmaids the night before added to the experience with the added feature of the hot tub, the groomsmen were very jealous. The beds were very comfortable and everyone was excited to stay in a castle.
On the day of the wedding, the staff were very accommodating moving the bridal party along to the bridal suite to finish preparations earlier than originally planned. The breakfast provided was the perfect amount for a busy morning getting ready. Everything, including the gardens, were immaculately kept adding to the WOW factor of getting married in a Castle.
The canapes served and welcome drinks were well received by the guests and ourselves whilst we had photographers prior to the wedding breakfast. The food was phenomenal and great portions and I was stuffed after. The staff were very accommodating for us with a lot of people with allergies, dislikes of mushrooms so adapting the menu for these individual people. We were even able to swap out a few bottles of wine included in our package for cocktails as us as the Bride and Groom did not drink wine.
As soon as we walked in the venue the first time, we knew it was the place we wanted to get married. Everytime we went back to view the venue again I fell more and more in love. For anyone thinking about viewing or even booking this incredible venue I would say do it! We will be going back for events in the future to relive the best day of our lives."
V59,Clearwell Castle,"We got married at Clearwell castle April 2023. What can I say it's the most perfect venue and we had the most amazing day. The organisation was amazing and the staff were great on the day and even leading up to the big day. Phaedra was our wedding planner and communication with her was great throughout and on our wedding day she ensured that it all ran smoothly. I cannot recommend Clearwell castle and their staff enough. Thank you again for helping us have our dream wedding.
Kind regards

Vanessa & David x"
V59,Clearwell Castle,"We had the most amazing wedding day on the 24th of November 2023, the whole day ran so smoothly and all our guests absolutely loved the venue. The food was amazing and our guests loved the fish and chip buffet in the evening! The whole progress of planning the wedding was so straight forward and Phedera was a great wedding manager."
V59,Clearwell Castle,"Clearwell Castle exceeded all our expectations for our wedding day. The moment we stepped onto the grounds, we were captivated by its timeless charm. The staff, especially Hannah, went above and beyond to make every detail perfect, ensuring a seamless and stress-free experience. The Ball Room, where we exchanged our vows, felt like something out of a storybook. The surrounding gardens provided a stunning backdrop for photos and added to the overall enchantment of the day. Our guests were equally impressed, and many commented on the unique and romantic atmosphere. Choosing Clearwell Castle was the best decision we made for our special day; it truly felt like a fairy-tale come to life."
V59,Clearwell Castle,"We had the perfect wedding at Clearwell Castle, their team were superb in providing planning assistance from the point of our booking, guidance on all aspects of our wedding choices from registrars and suppliers, and coordination on the day of the wedding to make sure it flowed seamlessly. It was a beautiful day, and we couldn't be happier with our choice of Wedding location."
V60,Inner Temple,We got married here in 2023. Everything was perfect and the team made sure the day/food etc was just as we wanted it. Particular thanks to Priya and Eva (Pegasus) for their hard work making our wedding day and lead up so special.
V61,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"I got married at Dodford Manor in February this year. A great time was had by all and I will be recommending the venue to any friends planning weddings.

The weather was bad on the day so we didn’t get to use the outside area very much, but it didn’t matter as the inside is so lovely.

Sky was really helpful and put me at ease on the day. Questions in the lead up and on the day were answered quickly and I was made to feel like the only bride in the world!"
V61,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford was the first venue we looked at shortly after we got engaged. The staff were friendly and relaxed when we had a tour, I knew it was the place for us! I think Lydia telling my now husband that we couldn’t have fireworks due to the animals nearby but we could have a fire performer outside, sold the deal for us! I got an amazing fire performer as a surprise for my husband and the guests after we had sparklers, and it just completed an amazing day!
We heard such positive things Dodford about how professional and smooth running weddings have been from our suppliers, and you guys didn’t disappoint. You handled the day so well, we didn’t worry about a thing and just enjoyed ourselves the whole day.
We honestly had so many lovely messages and conversations after our wedding about how the venue was amazing, everything and everyone was catered for, from my 88 year old Nan, to young children who could play and enjoy the outdoors with a scoop of amazing ice cream. We honestly couldn’t have asked for a better day, we would do it again in a heartbeat if we could! Thank you for making the day so seamless! We are eternally grateful to everyone at Dodford for making our dreams come true becoming Mr and Mrs Price!"
V61,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford Manor what an incredible venue, from initial enquiry to booking, Dodford and the staff were so accommodating and well organised. Nothing was ever too much trouble, even if emails were being sent at 11pm. The day itself, wow it was absolutely incredible, as our wedding was on a budget and due to small numbers Dodford were amazing at setting out our decorations, everything was absolutely perfect and a special shout out to Kayleigh who was amazing on our wedding day. She kept us on time, always checking we were okay and just such a lovely person and really made our day perfect. Would highly recommend a Dodford to any couple due to be married they make the planning and the day an absolute dream and we want to relive it over again."
V61,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"It goes without saying that Dodford is a fab venue.... stunning set up, well maintained, clean, perfect grounds etc... but the best thing about Dodford is the team! I had super high expectations of any wedding venue I booked as I used to run a wedding venue myself (potential nightmare client 😂).... from the 1st viewing the team were fantastic. Relaxed, stress free, organised, professional, knowledgeable, flexible but mostly importantly friendly which gave me complete confidence in them delivering my perfect day.
In the run up to the big day the team are super responsive on email and phone We didn't meet our Event Manager, Lydia, until the day but I was always confident that they work as a whole team and therefore having 1 point of contact was not necessary at all.
In the day Lydia was amazing! Still relaxed and professional and the whole day ran so smoothly. Every requirement was perfect, on time, delivered exceptionally.
We had the best day, thank you to the whole team (especially Lydia!)
Vic & Tony

V61,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We honestly can’t say thank you enough for how amazing Dodford Manor Barn was, along with all the incredible staff who helped make our day truly unforgettable.

From the moment we visited, we fell in love with the beautiful landscapes, open-plan barns, and stunning large windows that flooded the space with natural light. The venue package was one of the best we saw during our search—it felt like everything we could possibly need was covered.

The team at Dodford Manor Barn were incredibly friendly and supportive throughout the entire planning process. Communication was open and consistent, which made everything feel so much more manageable and stress-free. We were even able to find all of our wonderful vendors through Dodford Manor Barn, which was a huge bonus!

As a bride who suffers from anxiety, I was unwell on the morning of the wedding. But I have to give special thanks to Kayleigh and our vendors, who were absolutely amazing and supported me through every step—they helped me feel calm, cared for, and ready to enjoy the day.

Our guests couldn’t stop talking about how stunning the venue was and how lovely the food turned out. We were also lucky enough to have sunshine all day, topped off with a beautiful sunset in the evening—it truly felt magical.

Thank you again, Dodford Manor Barn, for being such a perfect place to start our next chapter.

With love,
Carter & Emmie (24.03.2025) x"
V61,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"From the moment we booked our wedding at Dodford Manor, we knew we were in good hands—but nothing could have prepared us for just how extraordinary the experience would be. Every single detail was handled with such precision, care, and genuine warmth that it truly felt like a dream come to life.

The venue itself is breathtaking, but what made our day unforgettable was the impeccable service. The entire team operated like a well-oiled machine, making sure everything ran smoothly while keeping the atmosphere joyful and stress-free. Their attention to detail was second to none—no request was too big or too small.

We want to give a heartfelt, special shoutout to *Lydia*, our incredible Wedding Manager. From our first meeting to the final dance, she was nothing short of amazing. Lydia went above and beyond at every turn—anticipating needs before we even voiced them, coordinating flawlessly with suppliers, and offering support with a calming confidence that put us completely at ease, (apart from making me cry the second I saw her! 😂). Her passion for what she does shone through in every interaction, and our day would not have been the same without her.

Thanks to this amazing venue and its phenomenal team (especially Lydia!), we were able to truly enjoy every moment of our wedding, knowing everything was in the best possible hands. If you're considering this venue for your big day—don’t hesitate. It’s everything you hope for, and more.

We want to do it over and over!
A day we will NEVER forget!!

Thank you again and all our Love,
Mr & Mr Pargeter-Prince
Rowan & Karl xx"
V61,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We booked Dodford Manor in Feb 2024 after we viewed the space, for our wedding in March 2025. It was the only venue we viewed, but instantly fell in love with the character and variety of spaces the venue had to offer. The free corkage also really appealed to us as a great way for us to bring our own drinks at a good cost.

From start to end, the team were amazing, helping us with the planning of the day and making sure we had a great array of suppliers we could work with. The live band was a huge part of our day, and Dodford have a great mixture of acts on their supplier list.

On the day of the wedding, the groomsmen arrived at the venue to help with set up to see that our amazing event manager, Kayleigh had every single aspect of the day in hand and sorted. She sorted all table settings, decor, stationary - Everything!! Nothing was too much to ask of her and the Dodford team. The day ran impeccably well, with everything being on time and everything we asked for being sorted. Our drinks were served chilled, on time and were always around. It’s easy for venues who offer free corkage to try and limit you drinking your own drink - Not here!! There was constantly beers being topped up, wine bottles replaced and aperol spritz being taken round. Cannot fault them!

The team packed all of our bits away and ready for us to collect the next morning. We are very aware Dodford is a busy venue and wanted to make sure we wasn’t just “another wedding” but at no point was that the case. We felt like we were the one and only wedding and genuinely could not ask for more!

Thank you so so much for everything, Highly recommended!!"
V61,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We got married her a month ago today and had the most amazing day with them. Jess, Jack and the team made sure that everything ran smoothly and that they were doing everything they could for us on the day. We would 100% recommend them for anyone wishing to marry in such a beautiful setting."
V61,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We had been apprehensive booking Dodford for our reception that it was so popular in Northamptonshire that our wedding could end up looking the same as a lot of others we knew of, as we're local - but that was a ridiculous thing to worry about! The level of flexibility/customisation you get with Dodford is unmatched in our opinion; as it's such a beautiful venue to start with, you don't have to work hard to make it look good before adding in your personality as a couple!

The whole process from enquiries to final planning and the execution on the day were great. We did have a slight issue with them not inviting us to a food tasting in enough time before our wedding date (whether they forgot/we were missed off a list we don't know) but when we did raise it they invited us to a tasting at their sister venue instead (it's 2 hours away but we were available to travel thankfully). Every member of staff we encountered in our experience with Dodford were so friendly and make you feel like you are the only couple that matters for them in that moment, which we really appreciated from such a popular/busy venue. Abbie was our Event Manager on the day and provided such an elevated level of service, nothing was too much trouble and she executed our plans/vision to a tee, adding in some extra details that we loved too.

Our wedding was in December 2024, and we only had our reception at Dodford, so the ceremony barn was set up for our drinks reception with plenty of space for guests without it feeling cramped or equally like we were all rattling around in there (we had 75 guests for our reception). They don't have many photos of indoor drinks receptions in their promo so I was a little worried how it would look but the team had it set up beautifully. We also had a brass band on the mezzanine level which was really fun and festive!

What sold Dodford for us was the no daytime corkage, which meant we could really personalise our drinks reception and wedding breakfast drinks without breaking the bank. There was a slight disconnect with how and when we had requested/planned to serve some of the drinks in our planning meeting and what happened on the day, which we think may have been a slight hiccup in communication between Dodford and Jenkinsons (the caterers), but it didn't have a negative impact on our day at all!

Overall, there's a reason this is such a popular venue - it is truly perfect!"
V61,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,Dodford manor is an amazing wedding venue. From the very beginning when we first stepped into the venue to look around we fell in love. We knew we had to have our wedding there. After booking the venue we had amazing contact with the staff from booking our food tasting session. To a general email to see how our wedding planning was going. The planning meeting was well organised and we were able to talk through exactly what we wanted and no want was too big for the team.
V62,Gosfield Hall,"I never imagined my wedding would be somewhere as stunning as Gosfield hall but from the minute we saw this venue we knew it was the one for us and didn't bother viewing anymore venues as we had already made our minds up about having our wedding here! We were absolutely blown away with the natural beauty of Gosfield hall and so booked two years in advance of our wedding day! The professionalism and advice we received from Linda was super helpful and informative on the run up to our wedding as there is soo much to think about! We loved that we could have our day and evening all in one place aswell as the option weather permitting to have our wedding ceremony outside. I'm pleased to say the weather was absolutely perfect on our wedding day and we got to have our fairytale wedding outside! The package we paid for was well worth the money! Our guests were absolutely spoilt on our day and have all said it was the best wedding they've ever been too! It was amazing to have our guests stay over aswell! Jocie our wedding planner was absolutely amazing! She was sooo friendly and super accommodating and went above and beyond on our day to make it absolutely perfect with no hiccups! She even helped dress me on the day as she knew how to do up a corset dress and my mother didn't have a clue lol she made all my wedding details and decorations come to life and done such a stunning job decorating our dream venue aswell as being super supportive towards me my family and guests! The honeymoon suite is the best we've ever seen and completely took ours and our guests breaths away! Mind blowing! The food,venue,grounds,accomodation and night before accomodation were absolutely stunning and we want to thank everyone at Gosfield hall for making our day soo incredible and special and a day we and our guests will never forget! We can't wait to return to Gosfield! Thank you everyone at Gosfield what an amazing place!"
V62,Gosfield Hall,"We had previously experienced Gosfield Hall as a guest before deciding on it for our anniversary.

Our day was beautiful and went according to plan. Our guests all had great feedback about the day.

The only thing we would have changed would have been more diverse menu for the main meals."
V62,Gosfield Hall,"Gosfield hall is a beautiful location for a wedding and their packages cover all the important stuff! We didn’t have to worry about caterers, wedding coordinator or a DJ - all included! Great service, lovely food and everyone really enjoyed the day! Our coordinator Jocie was fab on the day, getting everything organised and fetching anything we needed. Couldn’t have asked for better, she knew the time line and the day flowed really smoothly!"
V62,Gosfield Hall,"We got married at Gosfield Hall and everything about it was perfect from when we arrive to view it, booking, the communication and Faye Carter our wedding Coordinator! If you want the best wedding day with no hassle, Gosfield is your place!!"
V62,Gosfield Hall,"Myself and my Wife have just got married at Gosfield Hall,
Our expensive started when we viewed the venue and we first met Linda sales manager, she welcome us in & made us feel at home, we wasn’t sure how, but she made us feel calm like this was where we was meant to be.
Once we looked around at all the venue has to offer we had already made a decision as this is such a stunning location and instantly new this was what we wanted! It was just right for us.

We did not get made to feel pressured to make any decisions immediately however we did end up booking our big say within the next few days after our visit.

Our next contact was with Ellie our wedding planner, she was very helpful and nothing was ever to much, we enjoyed the food tasting at the venue and was very impressed with the experience, it was out of this world.
Ellie helped us through all of our problems and made sure all of our plans come to life.

Now on our big day, what can I say? The staff were amazing, Ellie couldn’t have done enough every time you wanted to ask a question she was next to us any time we needed something. She was there all the way through the day/ night & even the next morning, Ellie made our day Run seamlessly.
We’ve been to many weddings before but never have we had food as amazing as we did here.
Every guest was amazed at the food quality and commented on how delicious it was!
Just to sum up if you’re thinking about booking your wedding at Gosfield Hall don’t question it just book it. You will be amazed."
V62,Gosfield Hall,"The venue is stunning and was the perfect setting for our winter wedding (so much natural light even in January). Jocie Golbourn was our assigned wedding planning specialist and she is so kind, sweet, patient and professional. All our guests loved the venue but many actually commented on how flawless and seamless the day was organised and rooms decorated and prepared from each section of the wedding and we only have Jocie and venue staff to thank for their meticulous planning and preparations. The food and drinks were delicious. Couldn’t recommend this venue enough- we actually booked the venue on a whim and were SO happy when we visited for an open day. There’s no false advertisements- it’s stunning."
V62,Gosfield Hall,"Everything, from start to finish, was exactly what we wanted and more. The preparation was helped by our wonderful personal manager, Tara, and accommodated each and every one of our requests and needs. The venue is gorgeous, food delicious, and atmosphere felt special. Our friends and family all told us that this was such a spectacular wedding for them that it was the best they've ever been to. We felt completely taken care of, kept us calm and happy throughout the day, and kept all of our suppliers in place and to standard. It felt glamourous and unique. We wish we could relive the day over and over. It really was our dream wedding."
V62,Gosfield Hall,"We got married in Gosfield Hall in May and had the most amazing wedding day that any couple could ask for. The whole experience from the arrival the night before to leaving the day after was seamlessly managed by the team at the venue.
The house and the grounds looked absolutely stunning and Ellie and the team did a brilliant job at keeping the day running smoothly without making anyone feel rushed. Everyone there was immensely friendly and helpful and we really felt that everyone who worked there was invested in making our day feel special.
We fell in love with the venue when we booked it but the whole experience exceeded out expectations so much that we wish we could do it all again!"
V62,Gosfield Hall,"I wanted to take a moment to commend and state our appreciation for Jocie. She truly was phenomenal, approachable and no task was too big.
We had 5 months to plan our wedding and we loved every moment. With us both working in the service industry it was great to have someone who was so switched on and would be an asset to have on any team."
V62,Gosfield Hall,"Having just got married at Gosfield Hall I can honestly say it was the most beautiful venue and the most perfect day. The staff were so attentive and professional. The food was outstanding and the drinks and cocktails were fabulous. They couldn’t do enough to make sure our day was everything we’d dreamt of. I have to say a special thanks to Ellie - one of the wedding coordinators on site - she went above and beyond to help us plan our day and was there from the very moment I woke up delivering fresh pastries for breakfast to the moment she made me a cup of tea to go to bed with. I can’t thank you enough Ellie, you are an absolute credit to Gosfield Hall."
V63,Kingston Estate Totnes,"When I first enquired with Kingston I thought it would be too expensive but we explained what are budget was and when we wanted to get married and they put a quote together that was affordable.
We have just had the most amazing one day wedding which didn't finish until the early hours. We got married in the Long Barn where there are chandeliers running down the middle, it was very romantic. There is this nightclub at Kingston which is very cool which everyone loved. The guests all said the venue was stunning and the food was out of this world.
A few of us stayed the night before and most of our guests stayed the night of the wedding in the cottages and barns. The staff were brilliant and they coordinated the whole day for us. I cant recommend the venue enough."
V63,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had a two day wedding at the Kingston Estate. All our guests were completely blown away by it.
Most of our friends and family had traveled far for the weekend and were not disappointed when then arrived as the cottages and barns are gorgeous. Some even have hot tubs.
Jodie and the Weddings Team organised a welcome party for the first night which was unreal along with providing street style food for everyone around 8.30 pm. At Kingston they have this really cool enormous Yurt and food hut which is used the day before the wedding and for breakfast.
On the wedding day itself we got married in the Walled Garden and there were endless canapes during the drinks reception. We then decided to eat in the Hayloft Barn which has glass windows overlooking all the gardens.
We used the clear span marquee for our reception party and had the craziest cover band before we all went into the nightclub until 3 am. The good thing about Kingston is everything is included they let you use things like cake stands, easels, knifes, speakers, microphones, all furniture at no extra cost, they set everything up for you and then clean up afterwards. We didn]t have to do anything which made everything totally stress free.

Thank you Jodie, Ellie and Charlotte it was insane !!"
V63,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had the most magical wedding at Kingston. From the moment we set foot onto the grounds, we knew it was the perfect place for our special day. It was our first viewing… and nothing else compared for us (we saw a total of 6 venues). What stood out to us the most was the variety of spaces available for each part of the day. The selection of ceremony areas, the beautiful outdoor spots for photos, the yurt for the night before party, and a special one for us… the underground nightclub for the evening! As party lovers, this was a part that sold it for us; there was somewhere for every moment.

One of the things we loved most was the flexibility to personalize every aspect of our wedding. The venue truly felt like a blank canvas that we could transform into our dream setting, but equally, we got away with doing absolutely nothing as it was beautiful all on its own.

But what truly made our experience unforgettable was the incredible staff, led by Jodie. They were not only professional and attentive but also genuinely warm and welcoming. Their support and attention to detail ensured that everything ran smoothly, allowing us to relax and fully enjoy our day.

We're hoping to return and stay in the future, for a special occasion.

It's not just a wedding venue; it's a place that holds a special spot in our hearts as the backdrop to the beginning of our happily ever after 🤍"
V63,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Kingston was perfect. Despite a rainy start, the day was amazing and Jodie was available but subtly in the background allowing the day to be ours."
V63,Kingston Estate Totnes,"After over a two and a half year wait due to Covid, our son and his wife had a wonderful wedding weekend. Jodie from Kingston Estate and her team of staff went above and beyond to ensure the wedding ran smoothly. Every detail was dealt with professionally. The accommodation, venue and food were all excellent and all our guests many from overseas had a wonderful time. The only thing Jodie could not oversee was the weather but even a little rain didn't spoil the celebrations."
V63,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue and staff were brilliant from start to finish. The venue is really multi-functional and caters for rain or shine. The weather was really unpredictable around the time of our wedding but I was a stress free bride knowing they had it in hand. The food supplier was stunning - we had a weekend package which all the guests raved about. That coupled with the unlimited drinks pages made it the perfect venue for us. A Devon treasure that feels like being on a film set - everyone loved it!
V63,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Such a beautiful venue - we loved it so much. The food was incredible and despite having a changeover of wedding planner close to the wedding day, it had no impact on our day what so ever. The venue are calm and professional and loved their approach to communication which was friendly."
V63,Kingston Estate Totnes,Fell in love with the venue on our first visit. We were particularly looking for a venue which could cater us for 3 days and sleep the majority of the the guests. The grounds were well kept especially the walled garden which is where the ceremony took place. The team were a pleasure and made the day truly special.
V63,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Our 3-day wedding celebrations were spent at the STUNNING Kingston Estate - a truly unique venue that we absolutely fell in love with. It had EVERYTHING we were looking for & more. The grounds are perfectly manicured all year round & come complete with walled garden. The cottages & main house are beautifully decorated, providing luxurious accommodation for 86 of our guests. Sarah & the team were such a pleasure to work with & couldn’t do enough for us. The catering was also top notch. Thank you"
V63,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue was great we had a few personal health issues beforehand but the team went above and beyond to make the day extra special. The wedding planner organised everything for us and they had plenty of props on site that we were free to use. We had the whole place to ourselves for the weekend it was brilliant and our friends loved the hot tub and pool.
V64,Holmewood Hall,"We were married at Holmewood Hall on 15th February 2025 and I can honestly say that it was the most magical day. We went to visit the venue and instantly fell in love with it but even we were blown away by how beautiful everything looked on the day. All of the staff were amazing - special shoutout to our personal wedding manager, Laura Pike, who was always on hand to answer any questions - she couldn’t do enough for us! The food was wonderful & we had full control over the menu. Would highly recommend this venue, you won’t regret it!"
V64,Holmewood Hall,"Holmewood Hall was an absolutely perfect wedding venue. The house is stunning, well cared for and beautifully decorated. All of the staff are so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Our Wedding Coordinator was fantastic, available from early morning of the wedding and was still there the morning after working for us. The food was excellent, drinks and canapes were amazing and the venue took care of everything for us. We had the most perfect wedding and are so pleased we chose Holmewood Hall. The Gold Room where we had our ceremony is gorgeous. Thank you for giving us a beautiful wedding!"
V64,Holmewood Hall,"I cannot fault this venue at all, the venue itself is breathtakingly beautiful with magnificent rooms and very lovingly maintained grounds. The staff are incredibly friendly, professional and efficient, our wedding coordinator Lee was a pleasure to work with and made our special day run smoothly. If you want a hassle free wedding with breathtaking grounds and the most amazing staff then this is the venue for you."
V64,Holmewood Hall,"Had the most amazing wedding here recently and cannot recommend it enough.

The venue itself is stunning and the options included in the luxe package covered everything we could've possibly wanted and made planning the wedding 100x less stressful.

The staff were all amazing from start to finish, Katie showed us around initially and then Lee was our personal wedding manager, and they were both incredible throughout. Always on hand to answer any questions and help us through the day once we got there.
We had so many comments from our guests on how lovely the staff were on the day!

A particular highlight though was the food - the tasting evening was a dream and the chef went above and beyond to provide a full vegan menu for us which wasn't limited to only a couple of options.
Again, we had so many non-vegan guests complimenting the food and saying how lovely it was!

Overall, an incredible day and an incredible venue.
Thank you so much to everyone there!"
V64,Holmewood Hall,"This place is simply just amazing 🤩
We had our wedding here on 17-12-24 and it was everything we dreamed of and more. The food, staff, decor were just perfect not forgetting the most beautiful Christmas tree 😍
Our person wedding planner Lee was an absolute god send not just having him there on the day but always being at the end of a phone to answer any questions or worry’s.
If we could go back and do it all again we would and not change a single thing.
The most perfect day at the most perfect venue ♥️"
V64,Holmewood Hall,Perfect venue for a wedding with guest numbers 60 - 100. Our guests and I moved from each room to a new room throughout the day and every room had a new surprise. The bridal suite was lush and it was great having all our guests staying under one roof. I would 100% recommend this to anyone.
V64,Holmewood Hall,"The wedding day and lead up to the day were fab. However, for the price we paid, we expected a little bit more.
I opted to use the bridal cottage the evening before for which we paid £450 extra. This is something I now regret, as there was no hot water and we were not able to order any food in as all the take away options were shut (on a Friday night). The hot tub also needed a good clean. So the night before/morning of my wedding was not ideal. I flagged this to the manager who advised that we should have raised the cold water issue as soon as possible, but seeing as we were trying to have morning showers on the wedding day, this did not leave us any time.
Our package included pre-drinks, wine with dinner and we also purchased a cocktail ""cart"" (cocktails on a table) and a bucket of beers. The groom, who is not a wine fan, asked for a beer with his wedding meal and was presented with a contactless card machine to pay for it at the top table. We felt this was a bit unnecessary as there was a full bucket of extra beers outside and it felt a little embarrassing having a card machine presented to us at the top table on our wedding day for one measly Corona, despite the huge amount we had paid. Also, guests were unknowingly allowed to buy beers from the bar after the meal, despite there being available beers to them already in a bucket next to the bar...
Overall the wedding was lovely, but for the price we paid we expected a bit better. Essentially, I loved the venue, but I wish we had not purchased any extras!"
V64,Holmewood Hall,"We got married at Holmewood Hall on 4th October 2024. From the first moment we stepped into the venue and I saw the magnificent Gold room I knew this would be the perfect place for us to get married. We had the most amazing day which was perfectly coordinated by the whole team at Holmewood but especially so by our personal wedding manager Lee. Lee was always quick to respond to any questions we had in the lead up to the day and nothing was too much trouble for him.
We honestly wish we could do it all over again as it was a magical day. We would recommend Holmewood Hall to anyone looking for the perfect venue."
V64,Holmewood Hall,"After getting engaged in late March this year we wanted to get married fairly quickly so booked Holmewood for the same September. The venue, grounds, accomodation were all stunning and we felt very fortunate it was within budget and the package we got was outstanding in comparison to other venues and what it included, which was far far more than other venues. We got to attend a luxe event to choose all our wedding food, canapés, cocktails and wines which should have made things easier but due to the unbelievable quality it made it harder! Our wedding planner Lee is literally the most fantastic person. He was flexible, fun, engaged and on absolutely everything. The day was ran impeccably and also smooth even with some weather concerns and speeches taking a bit longe than we thought. If you book here ask for Lee!! We had the most perfect day. Can’t fault a single things. Our guests all told us how incredible everything was with one even saying he will now longer not attend any further weddings unless it’s at Holmewood. Thank you to all the staff and as mentioned a huge special thank you to Lee! Your a legend!"
V64,Holmewood Hall,"Exceptional venue, stunning grounds, fantastic DJ, and excellent service. Highly recommended! Happiest day of my life 😊"
V65,Bourton Hall,"We got married at Bourton Hall on 08 March 2025 and our wedding planner was Harminder. The day was absolutely amazing from start to finish. All the food and drinks were of a high standard and presented beautifully which includes the wedding breakfast, canapés and cocktails, and breakfast the next day. The venue is gorgeous with lots of rooms, well maintained grounds and exclusive use. The staff are friendly and accommodating and the event was really well managed. We would like to particularly thank Harminder, who was supportive throughout the wedding planning process and the wedding day, ensuring things ran smoothly and in a timely manner. He is a great communicator, provided advice and guidance where needed and attention to detail. We really had a magical day! Thank you so much! We would happily do it all over again and would definitely recommend this venue!"
V65,Bourton Hall,"What a fabulous wedding venue! Because it's a wedding venue and not a hotel that holds the occasional wedding, they really focused on what was important and anticipated our every need. It's an elegant venue but with a comfortable feel to it. The team are incredibly accommodating and helpful and each couple is allocated their own personal wedding manager to guide them through the process and to make sure every detail is covered.
There's a beautiful chapel on site where non-religious ceremonies can be held - this was fabulous.
The food was plentiful and delicious - all our guests raved about it. Great choice of welcome drinks and canapes, wines and cocktails.
The grounds are gorgeous; a perfect backdrop for our October wedding.
The venue was exclusively ours and has beautiful bedrooms, including a huge, stunning bridal suite. Most of our guests stayed overnight and took advantage of the brilliant breakfast in the morning so it really extended the celebration."
V65,Bourton Hall,"Our wedding at Bourton Hall was better than we ever imagined. The Italianate mansion is truly spectacular inside and out however it is the team that made our day run perfectly. Our guests found the setting and the food incredible, they were very impressed! Our wedding planner Emily Sarjant was fantastic her knowledge and expertise made our day magical from start to finish, with all the special touches that she suggested. Our first dance was created in such a beautiful way it will be a memory we cherish forever. Thank you to Emily and the team at Bourton Hall. My husband would also like to note that the croquembouche was amazing and everyone should have one."
V65,Bourton Hall,"My wife and I got married at Bourton Hall in September, with our wedding managed by the wonderful Eleni. Everything about the day went as perfectly as we could've wished, right from arrival to departure the following day. The venue is stunning, and the food was lovely, and having 21 bedrooms on site was such a bonus so that all of our close friends and family could stay on site with us.
Bourton Hall did everything they could both in the run up to the day and on the day itself to alleviate all stress to ensure everything ran as seamlessly as possible, which it absolutely did.
We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall enough."
V65,Bourton Hall,"We were married on 28th July 2024. What an amazing day we had at Bourton Hall. Could not fault it! The venue is so elegant! The grounds and views were to die for. The food was out of this world with so many choices and all cooked and served to perfection. Accommodation / rooms were plentiful and luxurious. Lovely to have a chapel on site too. We had the whole place to ourselves, we felt like royalty! Lots of varied rooms and areas for people to choose where they wanted to be after the wedding breakfast. We would choose the venue all over again!"
V65,Bourton Hall,"We had both our wedding ceremony and reception at Bourton Hall and the service was superb throughout. The house and grounds are beautiful with amazing views to go with them. The staff were professional and helpful during the lead up to our wedding day and during the day as well - even when we had an emergency prior to the ceremony which caused delays, the venue staff were able to work around this to move timings back in order to allow all of our planned activities to go ahead and be fully enjoyed. All the food was delicious and we had a wonderful wedding day thanks to Bourton Hall."
V65,Bourton Hall,"We had the most perfect wedding day at Bourton Hall. Throughout the planning process and on the day, the team were so professional, which meant we could relax and know that everything was in their capable hands - Emily was an amazing wedding manager. The building is beautiful inside and out, and the grounds are stunning - there are so many places for beautiful photos, and views out over the countryside. The food was absolutely delicious, it was so hard to choose what to have! It was also so helpful to have so many places for guests to sit and chat in the evening, away from the disco room but still part of the action. Having so many bedrooms onsite (not to mention a stunning bridal suite!) was an added bonus. We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall highly enough, and have had so many comments from guests saying what a beautiful, elegant but relaxed day it was, so I know they really appreciated everything Bourton has to offer too. Thank you so much to Emily and the whole team for giving us such a perfect day!"
V65,Bourton Hall,"As the Bride and Groom we were made to feel like nothing was too much to ask and they couldn't do enough to make us feel special.
All the guests commented that it was one of the prettiest and most relaxed weddings they have been to.
We could not have asked for a better wedding day thanks to Bourton!"
V65,Bourton Hall,"I had my wedding on 10/02/2024 I am so happy I chose this venue, It is really magical. My wedding manager was just the best! Emily went above and beyond to help me on my big day! I cannot thank her enough.

One of the main things about this venue is that t has its own chappel which is really special and makes you wedding seem more traditional, however there are more options/ rooms available. I wanted the wow factor and I got it.

Some of the options that made it great

*Onsite accommodation for night before and night of the wedding is really helpful
*Exclusive use
*Dedicated wedding manager definate gamechanger! (Emily)
*Menu choices are fantastic.

Everyone commented on the food being really nice ( we had the lamb) The evening buffet was also great. I paid extra to have a meal created as having part of my culture within the food at the wedding was very important to me, they did not disappoint.
Emily was perfect in so many ways, she knew exactly my vision once i explained it to her and she made sure that it became real for me. She adapted parts of the day so that it would work better, for example bringing the canapes outside whilst photos where being taken. Helping me into my dress, looking after my phone just everything I needed she was there. She really worked hard to make sure it run perfectly and it did.

Thank you emily!!! You made my day Great."
V65,Bourton Hall,We got married at Bourton Hall on 30th July 2023. It was the most amazing day ever! We are still receiving compliments from our guests on how stunning the venue was and the whole running of the day. This was 100% down to our wedding co-ordinator Harminder. He went above and beyond to ensure our day was absolutely perfect. He literally could not have done any more! Thank you again Harminder!!
V66,B&H Buildings,Bourne & Hollingsworth was such an exceptional venue for our wedding this September. This is the perfect place for you if you want a true London wedding that feels like a fun dinner/house party but on an epic scale. We used the top floor (the studios) for our sit down dinner (think candle light and tasty roast lamb) and headed downstairs for our reception with the basement club (below and hidden) for late night dancing. The place is stunning (greenery and glass everywhere and the cocktails are insane but what really makes this place are the people. The whole staff from Matt and Lizzie to the bar team to the dinner crew made our whole day seamless and so fun. Could not recommend B&H more highly for your London wedding.
V66,B&H Buildings,"Beautiful wedding celebration in the most stylish venue - we had an intimate wedding reception (drinks, dinner and more drinks!) at the Bourne & Hollingsworth Buildings. The staff members on duty were excellent - nothing was too much trouble and they served everyone with such professionalism. We couldn’t recommend it highly enough and we haven’t stopped talking about it since. All of our guests were so impressed with the space and how stylish it was. The bar, restaurant and greenhouse are all aesthetically beautiful and the botanical vibes make for a very relaxed, but premium setting. Special shout out to Lizzie who helped us coordinate everything and Matt on the day who led the team. Thank you so much - we had the best day and we couldn’t have wished to host it in a better venue."
V66,B&H Buildings,"India & the B&H team were seamless. Flexible, responsive, kind, and easy to deal with. They made our day so special. The food was fantastic, the drinks were lovely, and the value for money was first rate!"
V67,Leez Priory,"I never in my life thought I would get married in a place like Leez priory! The whole experience from start to finish was just fantastic. The price breakdown was manageable and there was no pressure to take any upgrades offered. The things we got in our package were phenomenal and having a wedding planner was tremendous - our lady (Leanne) was an absolute god send!
They catered to all our needs and we were made to feel so comfortable and nothing was a problem! I’d highly suggest going to an event there before hand, just to get a feel of what it’s like full of people and enjoy their delicious food. We actually enjoyed their entertainer ( singer) so much we hired him for our wedding ☺️
Lee priory is just so beautiful. I can’t speak highly enough x"
V67,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory on the 7th of September 2024. Considering how long they have been a wedding venue, they were pretty flexible with some of the ideas we had for the venue styling that turned out amazingly!

The staff really made the day something special and couldn't have done enough for us. Special mention must be made for Leanne, our wedding planner, who was amazing!

Highly recommend the venue and the incredible team that helped to make our day so special!"
V67,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in October 2024. This venue is stunning both inside and out with immaculately kept grounds and interior. The hospitality in the lead up to and on the day of the wedding was fantastic. The food was also brilliant. Another great perk of this venue is the amount of on site accommodation.

A couple of drawbacks / experiences during our wedding. There are only a few toilets in the main building which kept blocking and overflowing throughout the evening which led to us taking some guests to the dressing room or honeymoon cottage to use the facilities. You are also restricted by the venue on any external food or drink suppliers and the venues optional extras for this are quite expensive for what they are.

That asaide, we had the best day and evening at Leez Priory and would certainly recommend it!"
V67,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in August 2024- great venue and experience from initial viewing to leaving the morning after the wedding. Leanne acted as our wedding planner and was friendly, professional and helpful throughout. We opted for the classic package and the food was amazing quality with everyone commenting how full they were!
The venue is beautiful with several options for ceremony both inside and out. Accommodation was great too. The whole day ran smoothly with perfect weather - we will have very happy memories of our day!"
V67,Leez Priory,"Perfect venue and very attentive staff, lovely food and great communication from start to finish"
V67,Leez Priory,"Stunning venue. Fantastic Team. Very accommodating toward our unique ""surprise"" strategy. Our guests were truly surprised. Thank you."
V67,Leez Priory,"Leez priory was the 1st and only venue we looked around when we started planning our wedding. From the moment we stepped on the premises, everything just looked so perfect and exactly what we wanted from a wedding venue. When we got assigned our wedding co-ordinator Rachel, she was just absolutely spot on with everything we asked for and nothing was too big an ask for her. She made sure the day ran as smoothly as possible and took care of any issue that arose without me knowing (which I am forever grateful for!!)
The rest of the staff were amazing and very helpful.

The venue itself is just absolutely stunning and we loved that it has the pub area as well as the dance floor so it catered to all of our guests.

All of the rooms were lovely and it was so nice being able to stay in the fisherman’s lodge onsite the night before the wedding.

We genuinely cannot recommend this venue enough and it was 100% worth the money! 10/10!"
V67,Leez Priory,"We got married on a Tuesday in October to maximise the value of what we could get for our money; and honestly, we got everything we wanted and more. Leanne, our Wedding Manager was perfect at bringing an attention to detail and seamless organisation to the big day, and in the lead up. There wasn't one moment of the day where we felt stressed, as Leanne had it covered. In one particular instance, our flowers for the bridal party's hair hadn't arrived. Within five minutes of telling Leanne that we needed this, the flowers were with our hair and make-up suppliers to add the finishing touches.

Leez Priory as a venue is the most stunning setting, and offers an incredible range of areas in which the ceremony and reception can take place. There is also the opportunity for the bridal party to make use of the Fisherman's Cottage the night before the wedding, and for people to stay in the on-site accommodation on the evening of the wedding, making it the perfect venue for people also travelling from further afield.

Leez Priory were very accommodating, welcoming and were happy to work with us to make our day as perfect as possible. The food was incredible, and a total hit with all of our guests, and so many people have commented on how incredible the day was as a whole. You wouldn't be disappointed to choose Leez Priory."
V67,Leez Priory,They catered to our every need. To when we would ask for things they hadn’t been done before they still made sure it went smoothly. Leanne was amazing she made me feel so comfortable from the start. The whole day was stunning. Beautiful venue please go view it as you will not be disappointed
V67,Leez Priory,We got married on the 26 May 2024. This venue was absolutely brilliant! They catered for every need and made sure there was no stress on the day. Leanne was kind and level headed throughout and was always one step ahead! Do not hesitate to book- do it now!
V68,London Rowing Club,"We picked this place because we wanted somewhere fairly central and casual. We fell in love with the long room and the view. Our wedding was in October so we thought we'd have it cosy but we ended up with a beautiful autumnal day so everyone was on the balcony. The fairy lights were perfect and the other rooms were great to avoid leaving. The staff was so friendly and accommodating that we would definitely recommend the venue.

The only thing that could have tainted the day is that after three visits and many emails, we were never told that the river floods (a lot). We were flexible with our day so if we knew this we would have built it into our day, instead, I was told by the photographer on the day as I got out of the taxi that we wouldn't be able to take any group photos because the area would be flooded during the cocktail hour and half that we had assigned as photo time. This would have been disappointing but we all ended up running outside after the ceremony to take photos before the tide came in. My husband and I borrowed wellies for our couple photos. We had fun doing this, but I can imagine many couples being upset! My friend's electric car also flooded and they were obviously upset."
V68,London Rowing Club,"Annabel was meticulous in her help planning the wedding. Very knowledgeable and helpful.
On the day the rest of the staff were brilliant - there wasn’t an empty glass in the house.
Great venue at a reasonable price on the London riverside."
V68,London Rowing Club,"LRC was the perfect place to celebrate our wedding this summer. The venue staff went above and beyond to ensure that everything went as planned both before and during the event. Thanks in particular to Annabel who was responsive, helpful and always put us at ease in the build up. The location is stunning - couldn’t have asked for a better day!"
V68,London Rowing Club,"We just wanted to say an enormous thank you for everything. From the moment we came to visit the LRC on a slightly grey January weekend, we knew it would be a fabulous venue for our June wedding reception and it certainly did not disappoint. It really is the most beautiful setting and we have very fond memories of our guests enjoying drinks in the sunshine with the most fantastic view over the Thames. The venue has such character and lends itself beautifully to a wedding reception. We have received so many compliments from our guests and I would encourage anyone thinking about booking their wedding at the LRC to do it, you will not regret it! We were lucky to be blessed with beautiful weather so were able to have our jazz musicians play on the balcony for the drinks reception before moving into the Long Room for our meal. It looked stunning with the tables dressed and mantles adorned with flowers. Following the meal and speeches, guests enjoyed drinks back on the balcony and in the Fairburn and Members Rooms which provide plenty of seating, whilst the Long Room was cleared and the band set up. We then partied the night away.

From start to finish, the organisation was so straight forward. Annabel was very accommodating and full of helpful advice in the run up. I knew that on the day she would ensure things ran like clock work, which of course they did. Our suppliers also commented on how helpful the LRC team were to work with. On the day the staff were brilliant and went out of their way to ensure everything ran smoothly (including borrowing some large gym fans from the rowers to put in the Long Room to keep us cool as it was an unexpectedly hot day). We really can’t thank you enough and now need to think of an excuse to host another party with you in the future!"
V68,London Rowing Club,"We got married in St. Mary's church and then had our reception in the London Rowing Club in February 2023. It far exceeded our expectations and was an incredible fabulous stress-free day with thanks to the wonderful Annabel making the day just run.

In the lead up to the event, Annabel was incredibly responsive, helpful and helped us plan the day exactly how we wanted it. She answered all our questions really quickly, always got back to us, was very flexible with what we could do and allowing us to personalise the space. Prior to the event, Annabel arranged for us to go and have a look around on a couple of additional occasions to help us plan how we would want it to look. She also gave our caterers a tour of the kitchens as they were new to the venue.

In the immediate lead up to the day, Annabel helped with our suppliers in getting chairs delivered and bringing all the wine over a day earlier. On the day, she helped to make the day flow and just dealt with things throughout the day.

The venue itself is beautiful with three rooms to use. A middle reception room, a cosy snug and the main long room. In the main long room, there is a rowing boat hanging upside down with fairly lights. The main lighting can be dimmed and gave a wonderful atmosphere for the evening meal. As our wedding was a winter wedding, it was fairly chilly so they lit fires in the main room and snug which added to the atmosphere.

We had around 90 guests - could have fitted a few more just about. We used the round tables, tablecloths, linen, plates cutlery and glasses provided and they were perfect for a wedding and looked very smart. No need to hire these. As mentioned, we did hire separate wedding chairs instead of the conference chairs provided. There's a lot of decoration in the way of rowing memorabilia on the walls which means you don't have to actually do too much to make it interesting for guests.

Overall, the perfect London wedding venue with absolutely fabulous views across the Thames with a long balcony to enjoy from. To top it off Annabel is truly amazing and so helpful."
V68,London Rowing Club,"We had our wedding (ceremony+reception) at LRC in July, and the venue itself and the team we worked with were absolutely incredible! Everything on the day went without a hitch and we heard so many compliments on the location - our guests loved the balcony and the layout inside, which included plenty of space for anyone wanting a break from dancing to sit down and relax. Would recommend to anyone looking to host an event!"
V68,London Rowing Club,"London Rowing Club is a truly fantastic venue and we were both so delighted with how our day went! The venue has real character with the classic rowing memorabilia and it’s location on the Thames, and looks amazing when it’s all set up. The layout and size of rooms I thought were perfect for our wedding of about 70 (+15ish more in the evenings) and of course the big attraction is the balcony which all of our guests adored!! (I wish I’d had more time during the day to stand out there and enjoy it 😂). Not only is it a fantastic venue in a great location but what really made this the most amazing venue was how great all of the staff, and all the recommend suppliers were! The day exceeded expectations and we got compliments on the place and the staff from all our guests. Couldn’t be happier with the venue, it was perfect for us!!"
V68,London Rowing Club,"We found the London Rowing Club while desperately combing through London locations after our original venue fell through a few months before the day.
Luckily for us it was available due to a cancellation - kismet!
From the start the charming Annabel put us very much at ease and helped us to envisage the day as we hoped it would be. She was very flexible and helpful throughout the planning process.
We were incredibly lucky with the weather on the day and the venue really came into its own - it was virtually impossible to get guests off the terrace, which is the perfect size for our smallish event (65 people) and of course offers gorgeous river views.
We were well looked after by the team and everything went off without a hitch. The interior of the space itself is lovely with a great sense of history.
Nice additional touch - table tennis was made available in the entry room for the later part of the evening!

It's a special place and I'd thoroughly recommend for anyone seeking a memorable spot to tie the knot!"
V68,London Rowing Club,"We got married at the London Rowing Club on a brilliantly sunny winter day on Saturday. All the way through in the run up (after 2 years or more of postponements), Annabel and team bent over backwards to help us arrange everything, recommended some brilliant suppliers for food (Shona Pollock comes highly recommended) and flowers (same with Steph the charityflorist.)

So many of our guests said how lovely the venue and staff were on the day, and the whole place looked a million dollars with an amazing photo set on and around the balcony and river - although we haven't seen those yet. The corkage and bar tariff prices are also incredibly reasonable for an inner London location!

I can't recommend the LRC highly enough. It will live in memory for a very long time."
V68,London Rowing Club,"The London Rowing Club team alongside the Dinner Ladies went above and beyond to ensure that we had the wedding perfectly fitting our requirements. Throughout the entire all of the suppliers worked seamlessly together to ensure the space transformed as we progressively added guests and transitioned between eating, our ceremony, more eating, music and dancing. We wouldn’t have had it any other way. The attention to detail of the team is second to none - perfect for any bride and groom seeking a beautiful event."
V69,The Prince Albert,"The team at The Prince Albert were always accommodating, made everything easy and stress-free, and helped us organise an amazing wedding party. They really knew what they were doing, and helped guide us through the process calmly, working around our schedule (which wasn't easy - we live abroad!) to make sure all our last-minute worries and concerns were sorted smoothly. The food was excellent, and the space was fantastic for our party. Can't recommend it highly enough!"
V69,The Prince Albert,"We had such a happy wedding with Harrison and this venue. Harrison was really flexible and answered any questions we had and made great suggestions when we needed seating arrangements, the schedule for the day, a florist, and more. The day was accessible to everyone and the food and drink were perfect. Thank you for making out wedding stress free and wonderful."
V69,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert was the most wonderful venue for our London wedding. We came across the venue at there wedding fair and chose alot of our suppliers from the same wedding fair.

Harrison and Lauren were always so on hand to help with any questions and did a fantastic job answering all of our questions. The staff were so friendly and helpful and made everything run like clockwork.

We couldn’t recommend The Prince Albert enough for a london wedding and would love to do it all again."
V69,The Prince Albert,"My wife and I were beyond happy with how everything went on our wedding day. Harrison, Diana, Claudio and the whole team were absolutely phenomenal! It was such a beautifully efficient operation, and we always felt like someone was there to help us when needed.

We've had dozens of compliments about the great food and how wonderfully intimate the venue was for a wedding. Some of our more traditional relatives said they were initially sceptical at the prospect of a pub wedding, but that it was one of the most beautiful and joyful weddings they’d been to. A friend of mine was also very happy that someone at the bar remembered her drink order throughout the evening! On top of that, everything ran perfectly to schedule, which is no doubt down to the high attention to detail.

It was very useful that the upstairs was free on Friday afternoon so that we could set up the space. It gave us plenty of time to do the flower arrangements, put up the bunting, and stick photos on the frame wall.

Thank you again so much for all the help and support you've given us - it really was the best day of our lives (so far)!"
V69,The Prince Albert,"My husband and I got married here in late September 2023, and I cannot recommend the Prince Albert enough!! Booking a wedding venue can be stressful and we felt like a lot of the venues we looked at gave us the ""hard sell"" but the folks at the Prince Albert helped to put us at ease every step of the way. We fell in love with how beautiful the pub was, so hired the upstairs for the ceremony, wedding breakfast and party afterwards for around 40 - 45 people. We were able to drop off decorations the night before and talk it all through with the staff, and they did such a good job of working with us and the florist to get the place looking amazing. The ceremony went off without a hitch, everybody loved the food and we had a blast in the evening. All the staff were amazing, but special shout out to Harrison and Lauren for helping us plan and run the day, and Maria for managing everything on the ground both when we dropped off the decorations and during the wedding itself. Thank you again for helping us celebrate our special day with our loved ones, for making it so stress free and so memorable!"
V69,The Prince Albert,"All you ever hear about wedding venues is that everything is a rip off, the food is meh, and there are a ton of annoying restrictions...the opposite is true of Harrison and The Prince Albert team. From Day 1, Harrison made the whole process not only easy but really fun! He was quick to respond, super knowledgeable, and very accommodating; he even helped our best man execute a surprise for us without it disrupting any timings. On the day, they decorated the place beautifully, managed to serve a 3 course dinner to 76 people unbelievably fast, and everyone raved about the food - to say they did a good job is a gross understatement, they went above and beyond. We were after ""classy fun"" and that's exactly what we got - thank you so so much!"
V69,The Prince Albert,"We had the exact wedding reception we wanted at the Prince Albert thanks to Harrison, Claudio and the other amazing staff who helped us feel so relaxed in the build up and during. We wanted a very low-key vibe and the team understood that but there were enough options for any style of wedding you wanted. The upstairs function room felt cozy and intimate while still leaving breathing room and space to dance, but you could easily rent the whole place if you wanted more guests and even choose to do your ceremony there. We had the most compliments on our food (we chose a buffet option). The team were particularly accomodating to some complicated dietary requirements and it was all delicious."
V69,The Prince Albert,"July 6, 2023 was the most memorable day of our lives! A big thank you to Harrison and the rest of the team for assisting us through out the whole process. Our guests loved the Prince Albert pub especially the sumptuous food and booze on our wedding day!

David & Dannah"
V69,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert is a Great venue for the classic Pub Wedding.
Harrison and the team did an amazing job to organize everything. The food was great and the service first class. Only sorry it was over so quickly. Thanks again for everything."
V69,The Prince Albert,"We found The Prince Albert when our original venue cancelled on us less than 2 months before our wedding. & we are so glad we did; everything happens for a reason! From the moment we met Harrison, we knew we were in safe hands, and the team at the Prince Albert made our day amazing. The pub looked beautiful and we were very greatful for the effort the team put in putting up all our decorations. We had so many compliments about the food, and we were very impressed in the swift and organised manner in whichever it was served. Everyone had a wonderful time, and we would not hesitate in recommending The Prince Albert."
V70,Kindred,"We chose Kindred for our 60 person wedding and it could not have been better. We wanted a venue where we could have the ceremony, dinner and dancing all under one roof, that was wheelchair accessible, and easy to get to on the tube, Kindred ticks all those boxes and more!
The food is incredible, we really enjoyed popping by to do all the tastings, we'll continue to come to the Cellar for food and cocktails. Many guests commented on how good the food was.
The place itself is gorgeous, inside and out. We used the whole venue, the main Hall for the ceremony, dinner and dancing, and the Library upstairs for the drinks reception and cake cutting. Also, being right next to Hammersmith station, the venue could not be easier to get to!
The staff are wonderfully attentive and helpful, both before and on the day. They were really open to the little details that made our day uniquely ours, from the drinks selections, to having a table and glasses on stage for the ceremony, to playing our music selections at the right time. Plus its a dog friendly venue!"
V70,Kindred,"We LOVE this venue! We got married here with only 12 weeks notice and Anna, the owner, and her staff went above and beyond to make the day as memorable, magical, and marvellous as we'd hoped it would be. The venue is elegant, stylish and perfect for a London, city based wedding. The food is sensational as it comes from their in-house kitchen on the ground floor and every guest remarked on how delicious their meal was. It's restaurant quality food, not your standard wedding food. The place looks stunning in all our wedding photos and the wedding cake they made us (at very short notice I might add!) was second to none. Everyone loved it. The venue was also perfect for late night dancing and drinking and merriment. It was such a pleasure - and a breeze - to work with Anna and her team on one of the most important days of my life, and I very much hope to do so again in the future. I will forever be grateful to her and all she helped us with."
V70,Kindred,"We had our wedding reception for 35 guests at Kindred, in the Library and Salon earlier this year. The day went incredibly smoothly, the staff couldn't have been more attentive and our guests raved about the food for weeks afterwards. It was the perfect sized space for our intimate celebration, really cosy and the atmosphere was great. The little touches really helped to make the day special, with espresso martinis served for the speeches and sparklers for our exit at the end of the night. Thanks again to the lovely Kindred team!"
V70,Kindred,"I cannot find a single fault in our experience with Kindred for our wedding. Not only was it a stunning venue that honestly made some of our guests gasp as they arrived, but Anna and the team were so incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. Having them support us really took so much of the wedding planning stress away and we knew we were in safe hands. I really appreciated that the team were happy to chat through ideas with me and were always keen to find creative solutions to give us the day that we had envisioned.

The food was absolutely delicious and they were so accommodating for our long list of dietary requirements from our guest. The cocktails were also so delicious. Our guests were buzzing for weeks after, as were we.

On the night, the staff were not only incredibly helpful and efficient, but also just so friendly, welcoming and complimentary. We felt thoroughly spoilt and very well looked after.

We visited so many venues and this was by far the best choice for us. The interiors made for some stunning photos and the layout of the spacing meant that whilst we had 80-100 guests, it still felt very intimate. I cannot recommend Kindred enough!"
V70,Kindred,"We would give a thousand stars if we could. Kindred hosted us for our cocktail style wedding and it was everything we could have hoped for and the perfect venue for this style of wedding. The wine, cocktails and food (incredible grazing board, canapés, bowls and pizzas) were exceptional and the team were on top of everything, friendly and nothing was ever an issue. We would HIGHLY recommend it. We have had loads of guests message us to tell us what a spectacular venue it was with the most friendly team. The venue had different spaces to suit our needs and the AV is amazing - it worked perfectly for our live music band and our DJ, and our own music playlists for our ceremony. They took the stress off planning and really did mean we could relax and not worry that everything would run smoothly. Thank you so much Kindred team for giving us the best day of our lives"
V71,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The best day of our lives and me and my now husband couldn't be more thankful to Bredenbury. Before booking Bredenbury we visited over 17 wedding venues in Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Herefordshire - we fell in love instantly, there is no need for a crazy amount of extra expense on decorations, the venue speaks for itself. The fact that it was no corkage just added to why we wanted to book and the team were so friendly. In the lead up to the wedding they were brilliant, we booked far in advance and brought over all our family members to come see the venue, they were so flexible, understanding and welcoming - they couldn't do enough for us. On the wedding day they had decorated for us by the time we had arrived and all we had to do on the day was to enjoy it - which was perfect. It really was the best day of our lives, all the comments from our family and friends was how beautiful the venue was. They kept the day running so smooth and we didn't need to think about a thing."
V71,Bredenbury Court Barns,"There truly aren't words to describe how incredible Bredenbury Court Barns and their entire team of fantastic staff were through the planning process and the day itself. They were so friendly, supportive and nothing was ever too much. From quick replies to any questions that popped to mind to planning meetings that left us feeling prepared and ready to the day being set up beyond perfectly. Our amazing wedding coordinator Lianna spent the days and months (years really!) leading up to our big day making sure everyone detail was perfect, that everything was incorporated that we'd dreamed of and made sure we didn't feel a moment of stress from start to finish. All throughout the building from the bridal booth, to the orangery to the oak barn was beautifully light and open - even with our wedding being the end of October - and we had so many compliments about this! There aren't enough words to say thank you and explain just how much we'd recommend this venue to everyone"
V71,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We had the perfect day back in July. The weather didn't go to plan but they helped make the day so special even with the last minute switches because of the rain. We had such an amazing day and the feedback from our guests about the venue, food and service was great! We cannot thank the team enough for the effort they put in throughout the whole process but especially on the day. We felt incredibly supported throughout the whole process."
V71,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The venue itself is stunning. The buildings, grounds and interior decorations are all beautiful and immaculately presented. From the moment you turn down the lane it is so picturesque, you know you've found somewhere special. It's exactly what we were imagining for our wedding venue.

The layout is perfect, with ample space for guests to mingle and move about, and great accessibility for older and disabled guests. Ours was a winter wedding, and while most of the day was inside it wasn't cramped and we could still enjoy the beautiful grounds through the expansive windows that run along the whole barn.

All of the venue is stunning, but practicality-wise the Bridal Suite warrants a special mention. Room length mirrors, plenty of room for the bridal party to get ready, have their makeup and hair done, and if there's time to relax as well. Drinks were served from 11 onwards, and it has it's own toilets and shower.

From our first meeting at Bredenbury the staff were exceptional. They gave a reassuring air of professionalism and experience, with just the right level of excitedness for our day without it feeling forced. We were really impressed by how responsive the whole team were, with speedy replies to any questions we had during the planning. This is something we particularly appreciated as we only gave ourselves 7 weeks to plan our big day.

Value for money wise it felt tricky to gauge when we were trying to choose a venue as the headline figure is rarely what you'll end up paying, with different venues charging different amounts for different things. Not the case with Bredenbury. With their No Corkage policy and generosity in being able to use whatever props they already have, any extras were non-essentials of our own choosing.

No Corkage is pretty significant. Some venues wanted to charge £20/bottle, so not having to pay this and being able to supply not only our own wine but beers, gin and soft drinks for the drinks reception and wedding breakfast was not only a massive saving but also made the occasion more personal for us. The bar staff and catering team were excellent, pouring and serving drinks, warming our mulled wine and setting up the gin bar. Once your guests have drunk you dry the venue's bar is well stocked and standard pub pricing.

We wanted a Christmas wedding and seeing in early November that they had a date available that December we couldn't resist. 7 weeks isn't long to organise a wedding with nearly 100 guests, and we couldn't have done it without the Bredenbury team being so organised. Our assigned event manager, Harriet, was brilliant in the runup and on the day, as were all the other managers and staff we spoke with. The Wedding Bible they fill out with you is a great idea and nails down all the finer details to ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible on the day.

We didn't want to have to spend the day before and morning of our wedding worrying about set up and decorations, but needn't have worried as Bredenbury did all of this for us. A meeting beforehand clarified what we wanted where; we simply dropped off boxes of stuff the day before and rocked up in the morning to find everything laid out as hoped.

This organisation extended to the third party suppliers, of which Bredenbury have an extensive list of local recommendations. We booked the ceiling lights with Cotswold Wedding Co. and didn't have to do anything else. The band, Apollo Gold (incredible!!) set up without any hassle and didn't have any issues with Bredenbury's noise limiter. Our florist Katrina Bevis hadn't been there before, but again had no problem getting everything in place on the morning.

On-site accommodation was good for close family and friends, but there's not enough for the majority of guests and the lack of a dedicated honeymoon suite is a bit of a shame. If you want privacy for your first night as a married couple it means taking over an entire lodge. The quality and comfort of the rooms is excellent, though, and the continental breakfast served the morning after in the East Lodge was delicious, with ample options for Vegan and Gluten Free.

Jenkinsons are the exclusive caterer for Bredenbury and have an extensive menu for nibbles, the wedding breakfast and dinner. The menu and ordering process is clear, and pricing is what we expected to pay. Food and service was as slick and faff-free as everything else. A real delight.

On the day, Harriet and the catering manager were absolute superstars. Zero stress, everything ran to time and as planned, and they were always available if we had any questions or needed help.

The whole day was perfect and exactly what we wanted. I don't think we could have achieved this without the exceptional organisation of Harriet and the team. The entire process was very slick, zero stress, and we wouldn't hesitate in recommending Bredenbury Court Barns to anyone looking to get married in a countryside paradise."
V71,Bredenbury Court Barns,"I want to say a massive thank you to Bredenbury Court Barns for hosting our wedding. From the start they were super amazing and accommodating to us. They won us over with their care and support even when we had a pickle in the beginning.

Olivia was super helpful from the start and throughout the year we were planning she offered huge amount of support and suggestions.

We typed in “orangery weddings” in google when we were first looking because I was keen to get a ceremony in an orangery and Bredenbury popped up after much searching. Once we saw the Orangery we cancelled every other viewing we had across the country because we felt we found the perfect place, and nothing compared to the reception with the beautiful windows that brought all the light in. The grounds were absolutely spectacular and gorgeous. It was a no brainer for us to pick such a beautiful venue. They brought my ideas to life and we were able to get support on anything from recommendation of suppliers, to ideas on decor to their favourite meals from Jenkinson’s. They fully outdid themselves in love for us. We can’t forget it.

Our wedding day was exceptional with Lianna helping us all the way. She was a breath of fresh air. She cared about all the little details and made us feel relaxed and had a good laugh with us. The fact she was there 100% of the way, before the wedding, during the wedding, and even after is unmatched! Thank you Lianna for really being there to make our wedding day smooth and relaxing.

The food was incredible too and we often think about how sad it is that we didn’t finish our second plates, we think about it a lot.

Thank you for the wonderful journey BCB, you blew us away with your integrity, kindness, and genuine support!"
V71,Bredenbury Court Barns,thank you to everyone at bredenbury court barns who made our day so special
V71,Bredenbury Court Barns,"From the moment we stepped foot into Bredenbury Court Barns, we knew this was the venue for us. It was the first and only venue we viewed as we were blown away by how gorgeous the venue is. The venue itself is absolutely stunning, with breathtaking views and impeccably maintained grounds that set the perfect backdrop for our special day.

The staff went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. From our first consultation to the last dance, their professionalism and attention to detail were exceptional. Harriet was absolutely brilliant and I don’t know what we would have done without her!

The food was another highlight—our guests are still talking about how delicious everything was! Jenkinsons are amazing, they helped us personalise our menu perfectly!

We couldn’t have asked for a more beautiful venue to have our wedding. The day couldn’t have been more perfect! Thank you to everyone at Bredenbury Court Barns for making our wedding day nothing short of magical!"
V71,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We could not have had a more perfect experience with Bredenbury Court Barns. Right from initial booking all the way through to breakfast the following morning, everything was perfect. Nothing was too much trouble for our wonderful planner, Lianna. She ensured the day ran smoothly and our months of planning turned out exactly as we’d imagined. They are available to answer any questions you have any time, they’re only an email away and get back to you so fast. The venue itself if just gorgeous, the grounds make for some wonderful photos, and the orangery lets so much light in that your ceremony photos are gorgeous. The whole place is fully air conditioned too which was great for our July wedding. The bridal suite is a perfect balance of being aesthetically pleasing and practical for getting ready in, it’s so spacious, lots of natural light, there’s plenty of plug sockets and huge mirrors so everyone has plenty of room for getting ready and no one is on top of eachother. There’s even an outside space for getting some fresh air. I’m so glad we chose to have our wedding here, it’s given us memories to cherish forever and there are zero memories of any stress!! Cannot recommend this venue enough!"
V71,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We cannot believe how lucky we fell to get married at such a beautiful venue. Right from the offset of viewing the venue, to our special day, we were taken of. No question was too silly, and so much pressure was taken off us during the planning. We managed to make everything our own and Lianna was there every step of the way. Thank you for giving us our happily ever after. We will forever be grateful."
V71,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We loved our wedding at Bredenbury the team did an amazing job providing everything we asked for and more. We especially liked that our wedding coordinator for the day, Harriet had thought of everything for us she went above and beyond and even offered to go and get my mum some more shoes when hers broke! absolute 5-star service and the food was amazing too!"
V72,art'otel London Battersea Power Station,N/A
V73,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow what can I say, Brinsop is an absolutely stunning wedding venue with heaps of character and so many options of places for the ceremony and to do things. We fell in love with it as soon as we saw it and knew it was where we wanted to get married.

Right from the start, the Brinsop team were so helpful and accommodating. From giving an virtual tour then showing us around in person, Issy and the team were fantastic right the way through. Nothing was a hassle, no request too difficult and they were incredibly professional and responsive throughout the whole process.

We loved that Brinsop is an exclusive venue with accommodation on site so we could stay with the bridal party and our immediate family. All the rooms are unique and have so much character and it's fun exploring the whole place. You feel like you are in the middle of nowhere, in nature with swans, ducks and birds all around.

Throughout our planning process, Issy and the team helped us every step of the way, being incredibly flexible in managing our requests and really trying to create our vision. They even got their team to make a giant jenga that we could use on the day! They helped to create the most perfect bespoke wedding breakfast and canapes menu, and seemed so positive and excited to be part of our special day and experience.

Arriving at the venue, Issy and the team were ready and had everything prepared and ready to go. It made the process so smooth for us and meant we could really enjoy the day without any stress. Issy coordinated perfectly with all of our vendors and it really felt like she and the whole team were so happy for us and wanted to be part of our day which was amazing. Our guests commented on how friendly and responsive all the staff were and it really made the experience extra special.

I wouldn't change anything about the day and it was perfect. I would absolutely recommend Brinsop as a wedding venue and all the staff who are really invested in helping deliver your vision. Thank you so so much to the whole team for making this a day that we will look back on for many years to come with amazing memories."
V73,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow, what a perfect day we had! It really went without a hitch and that was thanks to Nina and all the staff at Brinsop. The team worked seamlessly to ensure the day was as perfect as could be, and it really was! The wedding was booked over 2 years in advance and the staff were so accommodating with all my questions, planning and site visits, they couldn’t do more to support us. Special thanks to our coordinator Nina who was a delight to work with and a credit to Brinsop. Everyone that attended agreed at how beautiful the venue and grounds were, it was a wedding people won’t forget! 10/10 would recommend to anyone!"
V73,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"It's taken me quite a while to get round to writing this review, because sadly it's quite a bittersweet one.

We were married last year on 15 June and Brinsop was our chosen venue for both our ceremony and reception. We were first attracted to brinsop by the accomodation, meaning our loved ones could stay on-site, especially my grandparents which was so important to me.

The home itself is absolutely beautiful, including ivy cottage which myself and my mum stayed in the night before the big day. It really was a picture perfect setting, and looking down from the bridal suite seeing the ceremony space being set up on the Wordsworth lawn was honestly magical. Id dreamed of an outdoor wedding on that lawn, and we were so grateful the weather cleared so we could have it. The team really did wait till the latest they could to ask us to make a call on an inside or outside wedding (despite being June, it was a gloomy day to start) which I really appreciated!

Another amazing part of hiring brinsop was the after hours space we were able to enjoy until 2am with our house guests. The games room was absolute fantastic and meant that if you wanted to go to bed you could, but you could also stay up, party and play pool. I really do think this was a highlight for our guests and would recommend massively if you can spare some budget.

On the night of the wedding, myself and my new husband actually stayed in one glamping tents which we absolutely loved. The groundsman was on site until we were ready to leave the games room, and he then took us up to our tent in one of the buggies, making sure we had plenty of blankets and even stopping off for some bottles of water for us. This was really special, and can't thank him enough.

Hugo Spritz!! Having hugos at both our welcome drinks and drinks reception after the ceremony was amazing. I'm not a fan of prosecco myself and Mark and the team made it possible for us to have Hugo's all round. We even sneaked some up to the bridal suite to have before the ceremony (thanks Nadia!). Our guests loved them, and the amount of people that have told me they now need them at their own wedding is crazy!

Onto the not so good - sadly it all started to go a little downhill when we moved things into the knot barn for our wedding breakfast. Sitting on the top table, I could see that guests at the top of the second rows of long tables didn't really even have a seat around the table and were just kind of plonked on. The seating plan hadn't been followed, and I don't think there were even enough tables laid for the service to be comfortable for people because there was a dance floor at the end of the barn (which I did not ask for).

It was quickly also brought to my attention, that one of our guests had had to put her child on her lap in order to remove the high chair so people had more space. We also lost about 5 napkins with them setting on fire from the candles because everything was just way too cramped.

I asked to speak to catering, and asked if there was anything that they could do. I was told 'well sure, if you want the whole thing to be late'. In truth I shouldn't have even had to broach this myself, as it should have been sorted by the coordination team.

The tables weren't changed, even after they'd said they'd sort after the first course and yet the whole meal still ran late. We've had so much feedback about people not having enough food, food not being easy to access on the sharing platters etc and honestly when you've waited so long for a day and had spent 25k on the venue and food alone, it really has been heartbreaking to hear. I do sometimes question why people still bring it up (even now, people talk about the dining) when it clearly upset me so much.

Whilst writing this review my husband asked my what we had for evening food - we didn't get any. It was left unannounced on a back table. I don't know what I was expecting, just not that.

The next morning, the houseguests were asked to come down to breakfast for 9am (it was on a note in the room) but as we were in the glamping area, we walked past the knot barn just before 8.30 and the food was already out. We ran down to the house to hurry everyone up, and by which time everyone arrived it had been sitting there for 20plus mins going cold.

My biggest upset was that when I fed all of the above back to brinsop, feeling pretty deflated about the catering, I was told they'd pass my feedback on and heard absolutely nothing back. 25k total with over 10k on food and drinks to hear absolutely nothing, and this was 9 months ago. I'm not saying this in would happen to anyone else, but really - it shouldn't have happened to us either."
V73,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our wedding! From start to finish, everything at Brinsop was flawless. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most magical backdrop for our special day. Our guests were blown away by the beautiful venue, the warm atmosphere, and the seamless coordination. Every detail was taken care of, and we felt so well looked after. The team was incredible, professional, friendly, and attentive. On the day itself, they ensured everything ran smoothly, allowing us to truly enjoy every moment. A special mention goes to our amazing wedding coordinator Nina!"
V73,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We had our wedding on New Year's Eve 2024 at Brinsop, and it was more perfect that we could have ever hoped for. The venue itself is stunning, with beautiful spacious rooms which slept over 40 of our guests. Our coordinator, Nina, was incredible and so supportive on the day - she kept everything running so smoothly and everything went by without a glitch. The food and drink managers Mark and Amy did the most incredible job - nothing was ever too much, they were so attentive, and the chefs the most stunning meal after we gave them a fairly vague brief of 'curry'! We had the most perfect day and we're so incredibly grateful to Brinsop and the team."
V73,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,Brinsop Court is pure magic—an unforgettable venue with an incredible team!
V73,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We were lucky enough to have our wedding at Brinsop Court in December, and it was an absolutely spectacular day. We fell in love with Brinsop as soon we set our eyes on the beautiful manor and surrounding gardens. Cate, Amy, Mark and the rest of the wonderful staff at Brinsop really go the extra mile to make you feel special, and are extremely flexible with requests in order to make your day feel more special. We honestly felt like there was no request too big leading up to the day and they really made us feel extremely comfortable leading up to the day.
On the day, Cate and her team were well on hand to help us with setting up everything and she had everything under control when there were a few hiccups. The day itself was absolutely magical, and that wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for everyone at Brinsop working extremely hard to ensure that everything went to plan and as smoothly as it could.
Thank you to everyone at Brinsop for making us feel at ease and ensuring that our wedding was an amazing day."
V73,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Brinsop, the perfect wedding venue! We got married at Brinsop in December and I can honestly say it was everything we could have hoped for and more. We found out about the venue through Hitched and was one of only two venues that we visited but as soon as we got the house we knew it was the one. We fell in love with everything about it and it was fair to say that our guests agreed with us with many saying it was the nicest venue they’d been to. We had the wonderful Nina as our coordinator and she was brilliant! Nothing was too much trouble and we had constant communication with her in the build up which helped our stress levels no end. The same can be said for all of the staff who were brilliant throughout and allowed us to have the best day of our lives with everything running seamlessly. A special mention must be given to Amy and the catering staff who put on such an incredible menu (including the tasting session that provided some of the best food we’d ever had) and ensured that the food has been one of the main things that people have mentioned to us since the wedding! We had our ceremony in the Banqueting Hall which provided the perfect setting, especially with it being a winter wedding, as it really added to the cosy atmosphere and the lounge areas/games room were perfect for the drink’s reception. We would have loved to have also had it in the courtyard, but the temperatures meant that the lounge with the fireplace was a far more appealing option on the day. We then had the wedding breakfast and reception in the knot barn which was decorated beautifully and was the perfect place for the party in the evening. Overall we really can’t thank everyone at Brinsop enough for making our day what it was, we can honestly say that we have been made to feel part of the family and already can’t wait to hopefully come back to stay in one of the cottages for our first anniversary!"
V73,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Where do I start!!
Brinop Court is the most stunning venue, it was the first venue we visited and instantly fell in love! Theres so much history to the house and we were treated like family every time we visited before the wedding and it literally felt like home the whole weekend of the wedding, my guests also agreed!!

A special thank you to Issy our coodinator who went above and beyond ti make sure everything was perfect for us. It was so easy to plan and nothing was too much to ask, even arranging our dog to be our ring bearer!! When they say Brinsop is dog friendly they really mean it!!!

What a place, what a day!! Thank you so much everyone, you all made our day perfect and it really was the best day of our lives♥️"
V73,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We got married at the gorgeous Brinsop in October this year. It’s hard to put into words how amazing the whole experience was. We honestly had the best day of our lives!!!

We fell in love with Brinsop during our first visit back in December 2022. We knew almost immediately that Brinsop was the venue we were looking for! From the outside the venue looked like a painting - from the picturesque views of the countryside, to the swans swimming on the moat! The manor house itself has so much character, and has a lovely homely feel to it as you walk around it. Our guests were equally blown away by the venue!

A big thing for us was that it’s dog friendly, which meant we could have our two dogs join us on our special day, it wouldn’t have been the same without them there! They had so much fun walking around the grounds and greeting all of our guests!

Nina, our coordinator, and her team were always available to answer any of our questions in the run up to the day. This really put us at ease, knowing we were in safe hands. On the day, Nina and the team made sure everything ran smoothly and went above and beyond to ensure our guests were looked after. A shout out to Amy who heads up catering and Mark who manages the bar. The food and drinks were absolutely fantastic!

I highly recommend this venue! There’s a reason Brinsop is an award winning venue - and when you visit it’s not hard to see why. We are already looking forward to going back there for a date night next year! Thanks for everything Team Brinsop!

V74,The Manor at Bickley,"The Manor is the perfect venue for weddings! When our wedding venue fell through 4 months before the big day, I stumbled onto the Manor at Bickley and spoke to Craig. He was most helpful and kind and went above and beyond to make sure our wedding went ahead.

We hired the venue for our two day wedding and the staff were helpful and accommodating from start to finish. All of our guests were awed by the beautiful well kept grounds and the excellent service. We can’t thank the staff enough for making our wedding dreams a reality. They thought of every detail from bringing us champagne after our civil ceremony to making sure we had our card box at the end of the night! We are excited to head back to celebrate our anniversary there!"
V74,The Manor at Bickley,"Myself and my Husband chose this venue for our wedding last week and we can’t sing The Manor’s praises enough. From our very first enquiry, to the first viewing of the venue, right though until the big day, the staff at the manor have been nothing short of brilliant! Each staff member we came across was polite and accommodating. Special mention to Craig and Vicky with whom we did most of our liaising throughout the months leading up until our wedding. Craig and Vicky were super helpful, responsive and went above and beyond to make sure that we could have the day of our dreams. Even with last minute changes due to the weather, Craig who was just incredible throughout, managed to help us sort a backup plan so our day would still go ahead seamlessly.

The rooms at the manor were spacious and modern, giving us and our wedding party lots of space for photographers and videographers to capture the special moments on our wedding morning.

The lodge that was used for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready was fabulous. The manor was very flexible in giving us early access so we could get ready on time.

The grand marquee was definitely grand! Very spacious and when decorated looked like something out of a fairytale! lots of kitchen space, a huge bar and fantastic overhead speakers for the party!

The manor was super flexible to our needs regarding access, start times, outsourcing our vendors and much more. The venue is beautiful and spacious with options for outdoor and indoor events and entertainment. The grounds were absolutely beautiful, so many lovely spots for photos not only for us as the bride and groom but for guests too!

A very special thank you to our point of contact throughout, Craig. From our first meeting, he was charming, bubbly and made us feel super welcome. He reassured us that he has experience in African/Caribbean weddings and that our wedding day would amazing and it was. He was attentive and always let us know that he was only a phone call or e-mail away and was always quick to respond and answer any questions we had.

All in all, we had the most beautiful day at The manor and we would definitely recommend this venue for a wedding or other events.

V74,The Manor at Bickley,"We hired The Manor at Bickley for my daughters wedding. Got a brilliant service from the venue. Everything was set accordingly, as per floor plan. Our guests were loved the venue grounds/facilities and the overall wedding set up.
Thank you to everyone at Bickley."
V74,The Manor at Bickley,"A warm and friendly service from the very helpful staff, a feeling that it is your own house! The food was amazing and the atmosphere made us and our guests feel fantastic."
V75,Davenport House,We are so pleased we chose Davenport House for our wedding reception. Charley and the team were so helpful and thoughtful. Putting canapés behind the bar for us and making sure everything ran so smoothly. I am obsessed with the stunning house and grounds and it was absolutely perfect! Thank you so much for making our day so special!!
V75,Davenport House,"Davenport House is a STUNNING wedding venue so how could we not have it for our big day!?

The staff were exceptional! From the moment we booked through to our big day, we had an absolute blast and could not thank each member of staff enough! Special shout out to Jared (hopefully spelt right, haha!) who made sure we were fed, watered and ensured we took 5 minutes to ourselves every moment we could - Also even saved us slices of pie wedding cake before we went to bed!

Our guests have said they have never been to a wedding so spectacular, with the most amazing food and amazing staff so could not have been happier having Davenport as our venue! 🩷"
V75,Davenport House,"I just wanted to write to say a huge, enormous thank you to Charley and all the team at Davenport House. We still can’t believe how perfect our day was, and lots of our guests have told us it’s the best wedding they’ve ever been to. The team were all a huge part of making that happen. It was incredibly seamless and well planned on the day, meaning we genuinely didn’t have to think about a thing, except for enjoying ourselves. The day ran to schedule perfectly and even certain touches we didn’t know or expect to happen were planned by you and the team, which made the day even more special. Thank you so much for giving us our dream wedding day. We can’t wait to see the full set of pictures and the video now to relive it all!"
V75,Davenport House,"Without doubt the best day of our lives. From start to finish, Davenport has exceeded expectations. From the very first impression of the venue during the open day, the incredible food tasting evening, all the way through to the day itself, including the support and preparation leading up to it. It was really important to us to pick a venue that not only ticked the fairytale box, but also come with the complete support of a wedding planner, due to our busy jobs. We were lucky enough to have Charley as ours. She really took the time to listen and get to know us, to ensure the day was tailored to exactly what we wanted. We even had our own cocktail designed, which went down an absolute storm on the day! She considered every little detail, constantly putting our minds at ease, which made the whole process so easy and enjoyable. Honestly the day couldn’t have gone smoother, any anxiety or stress faded immediately as soon as we got to the venue. It was simply perfect. So many of our guests were complimentary of just how beautiful the venue is and just how well organised the day was, and that is the perfect way to summarise Davenport. Any prospective couples thinking of selecting Davenport as their venue, hesitate no further. It will be a day you never knew was possible! We cannot thank you enough Charley and the Davenport team, if only we could live the day over and over again"
V75,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was amazing. When looking for a venue we weren't just looking for something wow, we needed to have people who were enthused and passionate about their work - we found that at Davenport House.

From our first phone call & meeting with Lizzie and Tallulah, we knew this was the place for us. Having two brides wasn’t an issue; combining British, Asian and Spanish cultures - wasn't an issue; having brides enter together – wasn’t an issue. Nothing was an issue. At Davenport House, we got it all – a picturesque venue and the best team of staff anyone could ever wish for. All our external suppliers have commented what a fantastic venue you are. All out guests have said that the service and attention to detail was second to none. The thoughtful touches like hiring a Spanish speaking waiter for the table which spoke very little English ensured that everyone felt welcomed. Guests with dietary requirements didn't feel they got a second rate meal or they were an afterthought - the food for all throughout the day was exceptional. The rooms / cottages where our guests and we stayed, spotless and comfortable. The thought behind adding some cheese and Spanish ham to the morning breakfast - so sweet!

Special shout out to Megan - wedding planner extraordinaire who kept in touch throughout the planning process and was exceptional on the day. Ian who worked tirelessly to ensure the day ran smoothly and the food was perfect, Charley who was also in charge of one bride and ensuring that everything was on point. All the staff were fantastic - polite, professional and personal.

Everyone keeps saying that this was the best wedding they have ever attended and that’s a lot of weddings between people! When we asked why, they say things like ‘the venue’, ‘the staff’, but it all came back to the inclusivity, love & joy that they felt – and you were all a part of that.

Davenport House is a stunning venue made even better by those who work there. If you want the whole package on your wedding day, we strongly recommend you book them.

Thank you to the entire Davenport House team.

Sat and Ana xx"
V75,Davenport House,"Where to begin with our beautiful venue and thanking the people who made it all happen! We got married in November at Davenport House and it was easily the best day of our lives. We chose Davenport because we wanted to host our cosy winter wedding in a big grand house in the country, with all the grandeur and class but to still feel like an intimate celebration with our family and closest friends, and it was perfect in delivering just that. It is utterly beautiful, the location was perfect and exactly what we wanted. The food was absolutely AMAZING, we had so many compliments from our guests and we are so grateful for the team in delivering such a fabulous wedding breakfast. Thank you so much to Lizzie who couldn’t do more to help us have our dream day, and Ian who delivered the best service to us and our guests (the pizza at 2am was very much appreciated)

Massive massive thank you to Charley our wedding planner, who was so so helpful throughout our wedding planning process and on the day, I can’t thank her enough. She was always there whenever I needed her, helped me so much with creating our dream day and I will be forever grateful to her for keeping me sane! Whenever I had any worries I knew she was just a phone call away, which helped me a lot when planning a wedding!

Charley, Lizzie and Ian thank you for everything - best team ever. Our day was seamless and it was all down to you and your incredible team.

Jess and Sam xx"
V75,Davenport House,"Me and my (now) wife chose Davenport House as our wedding venue in mid 2022, to get married in September 2023, and it was the best decision we could have made. We looked at a range of Georgian style manor house type venues located in Cheshire, North Wales and the West Midlands areas. It blew all of the competition away in terms of the venue aesthetics, the balance in design (i.e. period characteristics vs modern design), the impressive condition of the property for its age plus what it offered for our wedding weekend.

Staff and service - In the UK, this is usually something that is average at best - if you're lucky. At Davenport House, the service from all staff was 10/10. I honestly don't think we've ever had better service for anything. We had a wedding planner from the start (Megan), who was an absolute saint and was fundamental in making the whole wedding a success. She was also instrumental in helping us find a way for our 'little' dog Bernie to be a part of the main event. Thanks Megan!

Accommodation - The fantastic condition, design and decor for Davenport House extends to all areas of the estate. The rooms are fantastic, very big, well maintained and cleaned religiously by the venue. We had no issues or problems from all of the guests who stayed onsite over the 3 days.

Food and drink - This got a lot of deserved praise from the guests too. We got to tailor our entire menu and it worked perfectly for what we wanted for the 3 days. The oyster bar and luxurious charcuterie board went down particularly well the day before the wedding.

I could keep writing much, much more on how fantastic this venue was for our wedding. But the best advice I could give for any interested couples is to go and visit it in person and reach out to Davenport House with any questions. Our own wedding ended up becoming both perfect and the best wedding we've ever been to. Thanks guys again!"
V75,Davenport House,"Fantastic location.
Great staff.
Beautiful place to get married.
I can wait to film here again soon thanks for having me."
V75,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was a fairytale, everything we could have dreamed of and more. Lizzie and Charley were fantastic in their support, organisation and professionalism in planning our wedding. The venue is simply spectacular- breathtaking. Our guests were blown away. The day ran so smoothly it was simply perfect. The food was out of this world our guests couldn't get enough. All the staff at the house went above and beyond to ensure we were happy and having a great day. The team were also extremely supportive of last minute changes/additions. The Davenport experience was truly wonderful and I'm sad to see it end right from our initial meetings, food tasting and finally our special day. Thank you: Lizzie, Charley, Ian and all of the team for a truly memorable day for us and our guests. Mr and Mrs Kissane"
V75,Davenport House,"We got married at Davenport House in February and they provided us with the most perfect day. Lizzie, Charley, Ian and the rest of the team were the best hosts we could have hoped for. Nothing was too much to ask and the guests all commented on the hospitality shown to them. The setting is utterly gorgeous, our weather was less than favourable so we did not make the most of the grounds but this didn't matter, the house was setting enough and so atmospheric! The food was utterly AMAZING and better than most restaurant food I have eaten. The venue feels intimate and grand at the same time.
I literally cannot recommend this place enough, they gave us the wedding we had always wanted and more!"

V77,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge on 12 May 2023 and it was incredible. The views are gorgeous and the photo opportunities are endless with beautiful floral and green surroundings. The team were super responsive throughout the process which is really reassuring and helpful when planning a wedding, and Nelson who ran the day was just fantastic. Every single detail was thought of and they run a really slick operation. This is essential as it meant I had a lot less to think about! They put me and my partner at ease throughout. The food and service on the day was fantastic, so many of our guests said this was the best food they’ve ever had at a wedding. Highly recommend! (Photos by Costa Weddings UK)"

V77,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge in October 2024. The whole day was magical, including the beautiful view over the autumn trees in Richmond Park. Robert made sure everything ran perfectly and helped us to find slots in the busy wedding timetable to fit in some special moments to also reflect traditions from my husband's Dutch culture. The food was great and the staff were polite and fun. All preparation with Lucy was also smooth and done with a smile. The Pembroke Lodge team ooze experience but make every wedding feel special and really listen to your wishes for the day. Highly recommend! Thank you to the whole Pembroke Lodge team, especially Robert, Lucy, the kitchen team and the staff on the day!"

V77,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue than Pembroke Lodge for our summer wedding. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most gorgeous backdrop for our special day. A huge thank you to our banqueting manager, Nelson, who went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly.

The team was incredibly supportive and accommodating throughout the planning process, making it an enjoyable and stress-free experience.

V77,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We got married on the 3rd of October this year, and the team made our day magical! What a smooth day. We loved every second of it! The guests loved everything, and raved about the food and organisation.
Hiring Pembroke Lodge was easy. We had a viewing where all information was shared in detail and super clear to understand and make a decision.
On the months leading up to the big day our contact was Alice. Alice is a star. Responsive, professional, and had answers and solutions to everything.
On the day, Nelson coordinated the whole thing, minute by minute, and we are forever grateful for his politeness, professionalism and high spirits. We felt safe and in good hands. I would give Pembroke Lodge way over 5 stars if I could :)"
V77,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","My wedding went without a hitch, thanks to the amazing team at Pembroke Lodge (special thanks to Nicola & Robert)! They made sure everything was set up perfectly on the day, exactly in the way we had requested, and then ensured the day itself went as smoothly as we could've hoped. Everything looked beautiful and the stunning views made all of our guests fall in love with the venue too."
V77,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had the most perfect day. The team have all been so responsive and accommodating of our every request. The venue is beautiful and we were lucky to have gorgeous sunset views. It is truly a countryside wedding but conveniently close to London, which was important for our overseas guests. The food was fantastic and staff were professional and efficient. Would recommend to anyone."
V77,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We recently had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge, and I cannot say enough good things about the venue, the team and manager, Robert. From the moment we started planning to the big day itself, he was absolutely incredible.

Robert went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. He was always available to answer our questions, offer solutions, and provide creative suggestions that enhanced our vision. He coordinated effortlessly with our vendors, making sure everyone was on the same page, which took so much stress off our shoulders.

On the day of the wedding, he was a true rockstar! He made sure the timeline flowed perfectly, from setting up the ceremony space to ensuring the reception transitions were seamless. His dedication and hands-on approach allowed us to enjoy every moment without worrying about a single thing.

Our wedding was a dream come true, and we owe so much of that to him and the team! Thank you, for everything you all did to make our day magical."

The food was delicious and all the team was so welcoming and super helpful on the day.

Thank you so much, we really really appreciate all the help!"
V78,The Hackney,"If you are having a wedding for under 60 people then this is your place! From start to finish the communication and planning of the wedding was seamless and took so much of the stress out of the day. The totally customisable packages that they offer really does suit anyone’s budget and more importantly regardless of what package you end up going for it is value for money. The food was delicious and it catered to everyone’s tastes including a pregnant guest, halal, vegan and lactose intolerant and was the talking point for our guests. The venue itself is stunning! Lots of exposed brick, they had recently redecorated before our wedding and the reception room that doubled up as the dance floor was styled simply but made a statement and the outdoor covered patio area was a welcome addition. The team understood our vision from the get go and they completely nailed it, all of our guests couldn’t believe it was here! I honestly can’t recommend it enough if you’re wanting a small and intimate wedding venue but still with all the class. I would say to future couples even if you think this wouldn’t be your venue please please do have a proper look because it will change your mind, I had come across this venue multiple times over the course of a year and decided to take a leap of faith and give it a chance and we’re so happy we did."
V78,The Hackney,"We can’t recommend the Hackney highly enough. They made the whole process so easy and they offer so much in-house which we took advantage of. The food was especially great - our guests were amazed “best food I’ve ever had at a wedding” and the team took great care of us during the planning stages.

They offer a very customisable service with scalable pricing. If you’re having a fairly small wedding (under 60) then you must check out The Hackney.

We had such a perfect day and we owe so much of that to the fabulous venue. Beautiful space, so professionally run."
V78,The Hackney,"We had such a brilliant experience working with the team at The Hackney. We were regularly in touch throughout the planning process and the use of the shared spreadsheet was especially handy for keeping everyone informed.
We had to postpone our wedding two days before as we were both sick with COVID, and the team were just fantastic. They waited for us to recover and then we started to talk through options again. We were able to rebook just six months after our original date, and the team were accomodating and understanding throughout the process.
The day itself was perfect. Lots of our guests commented on the quality and quantity of the food and Hugo was great at keeping everything to time. We wish we could do it all again."
V78,The Hackney,"We had our wedding reception here and wow was it amazing. Hugo, Erika and the whole team were amazing. Every single guest commented on how delicious and plentiful the food was. The staff were amazing nothing was too much to ask and all so happy.
The venue itself was decorated amazingly, given we left our wedding stationary etc up to the venue it exceeded our expectations. I was concerned about the allowed decibel level for Dj / entertainment but it was plenty loud enough. I wish I could relive the day again, if you’re thinking about booking The Hackney do it! You will not regret!"
V78,The Hackney,"We held our wedding reception at The Hackney in July and it was truly the best experience. We opted for a standing reception for our 65 guests, serving food bowl-style for a more relaxed, less formal feel. The food was absolutely delicious and there was lots of it - it just kept coming! Our guests are still raving about how good the food was months later! Lots of good drinks options too - we especially like the cocktails here!

The staff on the night were so friendly, welcoming and were amazing with our children guests too!

The Hackney is such an aesthetic venue with exposed brick walls and existing foliage which we loved, so we kept additional decorations to a minimum. We dropped our decorations to The Hackney the day before and picked them up the day after, which was super easy! We hadn’t given them too much direction with where we wanted everything placed but when we turned up to the venue on the day it was truly perfect! The staff know exactly what they’re doing and had decorated it beautifully! The outdoor seating area is a great feature too (especially for our two greyhounds who chilled out there for the majority of the reception!)

We opted for a simple Spotify playlist for our music and their sound system was good.

The wedding planning process was super easy from start to finish, with continued support and check-ins from Hugo, from the moment we booked, to the day itself! We really enjoyed the menu tasting experience earlier in the year too, which is a great touch in the build up to the big day! The planning spreadsheet was easy to use and made us feel content and relaxed, knowing that everything was under control.

Overall, we would highly recommend The Hackney to anyone looking for an affordable, dog-friendly, wedding reception venue with a laidback vibe, delicious food and lovely friendly staff! We look forward to coming back every year to celebrate our anniversary, with an espresso martini!"
V78,The Hackney,"We hosted our wedding reception with the team at the hackney in May 2023. The planning experience was straight forward and easy to book. The availability for the venue is on the website so easy to see when they have and get it booked. We went with the 5 canapés, bowl food menu, and drinks on arrival with wine through the event. The staff were brilliant and food delicious.

We loved the vibe of the venue as we wanted a bit more of a casual event, with a relaxed feel and we were able to host our 85 guests with no issues (although limited to standing event at this size, there is enough scattered seating for anyone to sit when they wanted).

In terms of decorating, we didn't feel the need to add any extra flowers as the venue was already so made up with plants and other decorations.

We did add the photo box which I highly recommend, was great fun for our friends and family and came with a memory book. People were shy at first but really got into it. We also used the recommended baker who provided a delicious cake.

Final area to mention - pricing. Wedding venues can be really expensive and daunting before you even start paying for any food or drink. Something that really attracted us to this venue was the low spacing cost and the minimum spend with it. It meant that we were able to completely customise the experience and see where the money we were spending was going. There are many different options and packages to go with, so it's up to you.

Only thing that wasn't offered was any tasting of the food beforehand which we would've liked to have done but none the less, the food was delicious so it wasn't really needed!

To finish, we loved every moment of it and hope that many others get to experience the same. Thank you very much team at the hackney!"
V78,The Hackney,"We had our reception in July. The venue was cosy and comfortably fit 30 people without feeling too crowded or too empty (we were worried it might be too empty). We managed to fit a band in, arranged mini-golf in the venue after dinner, and customize the cocktail menu with custom recipe (that we provided before hand).

One of the biggest highlights was the food. The crispy roast pork got so many complements and indeed it was tasty. But really, all the dishes were amazing (we had a tasting session prior), it was hard to choose, but the taste of each dish was still top notch on the day itself too. I heard that the supper snacks we ordered were great too but alas, I was too busy and they were snapped up instantly!

Some other details:
* We were allowed to use the small room downstairs as a private space to put our stuff. Very handy to not mess up items.
* We went with a bar tab and kept increasing the budget each time till the end of the night instead of the all-you-can-drink. From our rough calculations, it worked out about the same going for all-you-can-drink. Of course, certain folk were heavy weights and more than made it up will be different for each crowd.
* Lighting for photos came out excellent (combination of photographer and venue lighting).
* You can adjust air conditioning to suit the weather (we had ours on the warm side due to older folk not dealing with cold too well).
* Outdoor space was a pleasant change in atmosphere for those who wanted some fresh air.

What about the review from the Bride? Bride approved this review."
V78,The Hackney,"The day was fabulous - Hugo was brilliant and flexible with what we were after. The tasting day before was such a great idea and the whole experience and guidance given made planning a wedding in c.5 months so much easier. We had vegans, last minute drop outs, ridiculously hot weather, about 3 different spotify playlists, a string quartet, florists arriving in the morning and a cake that arrived the day before - the team took it all in their stride and it seemed like a breeze. Loved it all and we've had such good feedback from guests. A fabulous whirlwind.

Two very minor points for feedback - we maxed out the guest numbers (the team did advise us against it but were very accommodating despite us also throwing musicians into the mix) and it was a little too crowded pre-lunch on such a hot day. We also put some speeches in between courses (again, we were recommended against it) and that may have been a slight mistake for the dessert timings, as the tasting day was 10/10. But, it was a perfect day in a stunning venue. Loved it - thank you guys."
V78,The Hackney,"Jon and the team were absolute superstars, hosting the perfect wedding day for us. The space is beautiful, the decor is modern and perfect. They were so accommodating for any request or question we had which we really appreciated. Guests commented on how great the cocktails were! The day ran so smoothly and we had a fantastic time."
V78,The Hackney,"From the initial phonecall to the warm welcome we got when we first visited The Hackney, we knew we were in safe hands and that we’d made the perfect choice. The venue offers the most beautiful interiors - the perfect mix of cosy, intimate and modern industrial - exactly what we were looking for!

Our entire experience with The Hackney was an absolute dream -we loved the mega organised approach to planning. Something that could have been incredibly intimidating was made so straightforward with the amazing support of Hugo the General Manager who embraced all our weird and wonderful suggestions and gave expert advice on what we could do to make things even better. We left every meeting buzzing with ideas and even more excited to welcome our closest friends and family to the big day.

The quality of the food and drinks is impeccable - every single one of our guests (even the fussiest!) has commented on how much they loved it. We absolutely loved the menu tasting, even though it made the decision even harder as everything was amazing. What makes it even better for us is living close by and being able to pop into our wedding venue for a coffee or a cocktail!

I couldn't recommend The Hackney enough - I just wish we could go back and do it all again!"
V79,PYRÁ,"We held our wedding reception at Pyra. We booked the entire venue, with the upstairs loft serving as a dance floor with bar and downstairs having tables and seating for guests.  Canapes were served upstairs and a buffet dinner was served downstairs.  We lucked out with great April weather, so guests were also able to enjoy Pyra’s patio and additional space on Lonsdale Road. We were very happy with our decision to have our reception at Pyra, and many of our guests commented on how lovely the space was, how nice the staff were, and how delicious the food was.
 
The venue:
The space is gorgeous with lots of natural light upstairs.  Guests arrived at 4pm but we had the venue for the entire day, and Pyra gave our florist access earlier to set up beautiful flower arrangements and candles - it looked stunning.  Pyra set up our welcome sign and card box too. The venue also accepted delivery of our cake on the morning of the wedding which was a huge help, set it up very nicely upstairs, and cut it for us after the formal “cake cutting” shots.  We were able to coordinate with Pyra ahead of time to arrange the space how we wanted, such as how many tables we wanted downstairs and the set-up of the loft upstairs.  They even had a microphone ready for us upstairs so we could say a few words to our guests before our cake cutting. Perfect! For the evening dancing, we were able to set the disco lighting to our colour scheme, which worked really well with candles and foliage (latter 2 provided by our florist).
 
The food:
The buffet dinner was fantastic.  Pyra gave us multiple menu items to choose from and we were able to fix a nice menu that took into account guests’ dietary restrictions.  We initially booked the venue when it had a different chef and menu.  We came in a few months before our wedding to try the new menu – our dinner was delicious then and there was no dip in quality for the buffet-style served at our reception. Fionn worked with us how to plan best - because we wanted a relaxed style with a dance floor upstairs, we ended up feeding our 80 guests in two sittings downstairs, which worked perfectly. The upstairs space can seat 60 people, which didn’t work for how we planned our event, but does look really nice in photos. The late night food served around 10pm also went down very well.
 
The staff:
The staff, including the bartenders and waiters, were hardworking, friendly and very nice to guests.  Enough staff were around that guests never had to wait long for drinks.  Members of staff cut our cake for us and also boxed up the late night food for guests to bring home.  Fionn, the day-of coordinator, was on-site for our entire reception and was very helpful, even helping coordinate our midnight bus arrival.
 
Responsiveness:
Overall we were happy with the responsiveness of the venue.  It took a little while to nail down the final details of the food menu and drinks menu/bar tab but we were ultimately very happy with the result.  As the venue hosts more weddings/ larger-scale events we’d expect this will improve.

Overall:
We highly recommend Pyra for a wedding reception. We had 80 guests in total, which worked very well for the canapes/cocktail hour upstairs (4-6pm), sit-down buffet downstairs (6-8pm, split into two seatings) and dancing upstairs (8pm-midnight).  The upstairs loft was able to fit all 80 guests plus a four-piece band.  Lonsdale Road is also a charming street that provided great photo opportunities.  We looked into several other venues, and came away happy with Pyra's quote – we were able to book the venue, food (including canapes, dinner and late night food) and a generous bar tab for roughly the amount some other London venues were charging for just their space (no food or drink included). We and our guests had a fantastic time. Thanks so much to Fionn and the Pyra team :)"
V79,PYRÁ,"We had our wedding celebration at Lula. We booked the loft and restaurant for this.

Positives:
The venue is beautiful and needs minimal decoration.
The food was amazing; the chef is truly professional and everyone loved it.
They redecorated the restaurant section and added a set of couches to make it a lounge, which was beautiful.
The staff was very hardworking, professional, and lovely.

They provided us with a lounge, a wedding breakfast space and a dance floor.

Flexibility with Cake:
The bakery was scheduled to deliver and set up the cake at 16:45, but they delivered it at 09:45 instead. The Lula team handled the situation professionally by storing the cake and setting it up at the correct time. They presented the cake beautifully and assisted in cutting it into nice pieces. It could not have been more perfect.


The list of available drinks was huge, and they were happy to make custom drinks and bring in different juices if requested in advance. The event manager tried to accommodate every wish we had, and on the day we could not have hoped for more. Most of our guests said it was one of the best weddings and most beautiful venues they had ever been to.

Negatives:
Food tasting for the wedding menu was not included, which we had assumed would be, but it was given at a 50% discount. We had to sort out the floral decoration last minute, as they had initially suggested they would arrange it for us after providing a budget, but later said we needed to find our own. At times, they were a bit slow to respond, which made us anxious, but after communicating with them, this was resolved, and communication was very swift.

In conclusion:
Lula gave us the most beautiful wedding we could have dreamt of. We highly recommend them. The venue, the food, the service were amazing, and we could not have hoped for more."
V80,Sandon Manor,"We had such a special wedding at Sandon Manor, the team made every effort to make our day so so special and we will be forever grateful for that. A dream team! The day ran so smoothly and they worked so hard. The venue is unique with lots of different spaces which unfold throughout the day, which was perfect as our wedding fell on a wet and windy autumnal day. We would highly recommend Sandon Manor!"
V80,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor provided the perfect venue for our wedding. From the initial conversations and meetings with the team, we knew we were in safe hands and had made the right choice. They kept us informed with any events, made information a bit payments clear and reassured us with any query we had.
The accommodation was exceptional and fitted our requirements perfectly, with high quality finishing touches throughout to ensure our stay was as comfortable as possible.
The wedding venue was incredible! Our ceremony took place in the gorgeously modern barn with stunning draping and greenery. Following on, we had a blissful drinks reception which was on the expertly manicured lawn (with mini golf!) and sun-trap of a courtyard. We then moved onto our wedding breakfast which was held in the main barn, seating all of our guests comfortably with space for decor and extra details. Following from dinner, the part started and the club room came to life! This was absolutely the talking point of the day and our guests raved about how incredible it was! It managed to create a club-like atmosphere, whilst maintaining the vibe, albeit at a reduced volume, in the rest of the barn. The layout of the venue was important to us, as it ensured our guests never strayed too far, to keep the momentum of the day.
The team at Sandon worked superbly with all of vendors which ensured the day ran smoothly from set up to clearing. All of our vendors commented on how much they too loved working there.
The venue, the aesthetics, the staff, everything was perfect! We would absolutely recommend to anyone getting married."
V80,Sandon Manor,"We cannot recommend Sandon Manor enough. From the quality of the service, the helpfulness and friendliness of the team, the beautiful accommodation and the most amazing venue which all or guests loved partying the night away in. To make it even more special the Manor is in amazing grounds in beautiful countryside and nature reserves.
Sandon Manor made our dream come true."
V80,Sandon Manor,"I couldn't recommend Sandon Manor highly enough - from our first enquiry to our Wedding, nothing was too much trouble. The team are so friendly and easy to communicate with, very approachable and responsive. They respond to any questions immediately and having the day before to set up with Tom was fantastic. Styaying in the Manor House and Dovecote was the icing on the cake as to be with friends and family the night before and the day after was so fabulous. On the day Tom and the team were absolutely fantastic and couldn't have done more to make our special day. We couldn't have dreamt of anywhere more perfect than Sandon Manor - a huge thank you to all the staff."
V80,Sandon Manor,"If you are considering Sandon Manor for your wedding venue, I beg you: scratch it off your list now. Yes, the house and grounds are beautiful, but the people behind it are absolutely awful. They ruined our wedding experience.

I will get straight to it. Sandon Manor has a very strict policy on guests leaving the site by 11:30pm (and no one is allowed back to the Manor unless they’re official guests staying overnight). We had lots of international guests at our wedding. Many hadn’t seen each other in years and would be jetlagged - we thought they may be keen to continue chatting after 11:30pm. With this in mind, we made a booking with Sandon Village Hall via our contacts at the church (where we were attending services and later married). They granted us access to the village hall until 1am as a contingency spill over space.

We mentioned this in passing during our online meeting with one of the Sandon Manor team a month before our wedding. Within hours, I received a voicemail from the lady in charge of Village Hall bookings saying (quote) “someone at Sandon Manor is trying to throw a spanner into the works for you”. It soon transpired that they had raised an official complaint to the parish council and pressurised the village hall team into cancelling our booking. To be clear, Sandon village Hall and Sandon Manor are entirely separate entities – there is no crossover between them whatsoever, as the owner of Sandon Manor later acknowledged.

It gets worse. Gob smacked, we asked Kate – the owner of Sandon Manor – for a call to find out what was going on. She was abhorrent, trying to justify her meddling as a necessary measure to protect her wedding license (side note: with Sandon Manor it is always about the money – once your deposit is paid they care nothing for your ‘special day’; you are just another cash cow). Did she apologise for stabbing us, her clients, in the back? No, she did not. She could not even fathom how hurt we were by being completely bypassed in the communication chain and how deceitful and disrespectful this was. My husband and I were quite literally left speechless. We’ve never experienced this sort of treatment from anyone, let alone our wedding venue - to whom we were paying many thousands of pounds. Dealing with this stress in the final month of wedding prep really took its toll on us and soured things. We no longer looked forward to our day, rather dreaded what Sandon Manor might do next.

Aside from this major incident, there were many other occasions when Sandon Manor were unhelpful and unfeeling in their interactions with us:

- We enquired if it would be possible to arrange a large pizza takeaway order instead of using Sandon Manor’s caterer for our late night food. One of the team explained on a call that this wasn’t contractually possible; we acknowledged this. We then received an email saying ‘If you are unable to follow this or any other of our T&C's we would be happy to cancel your booking.’ This was less than a month before our wedding.
- We had a harpist perform in the church. We were told she wasn’t allowed to play during our drinks reception in the grounds due to potential noise complaints (an acoustic harp at 2pm in the afternoon). No other music was permitted outside the house.
- Sandon Manor is an incredibly expensive (in hindsight, grossly overpriced) venue. But we were also hit with hidden fees when booking their accommodation option - an extra £425 ‘cleaning fee’ was added to our bill.
- At the time of booking, Sandon was running a promotion waivering the £700 fee for hiring their ceremony space. As we were marrying at the church, we asked if it would please be possible to put this towards other elements of our day i.e. using their festoon string of lights in the barn (for which they charge £450). They refused.
- We were unsure about booking the 1-bed Dovecote on the grounds as - at £499 for the weekend - it was a considerable expense. While we were deciding Sandon Manor rented it out on Air BnB (to one of our guests, which made for a very awkward conversation).

To summarise, you only get one wedding day. Kate and her team absolutely ruined ours. There are so many other lovely venues in north Hertfordshire run by decent, humane people. Please prioritise your happiness and choose wisely. I wish we had."
V80,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor is a stunning wedding venue with a great team behind it. The exclusive use of the manor for the weekend was a highlight, allowing us to relax with friends and family in the lead up to and after the big day. The Sandon team were brilliant, guiding us through the planning process and ensuring everything ran smoothly on the day. We couldn't have asked for a better place and team to help us celebrate our big day."
V80,Sandon Manor,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our special day. Holly, Tom and the rest of the brilliant team made us feel welcome from day one. Special mention to Tom for making the day run so seamlessly, so professional and accommodating of all our needs.

The venue itself is stunning, located in the beautiful Hertfordshire countryside. The Manor House makes for a tremendous location to prepare, and the Dovecote suite is a nice touch: a great addition for the groom to spend the last night. We loved the small details of the characteristic main venue, with the botanical feel to the bar a great backdrop to the barn.

It’s a shame we can’t stay every week!

Dan & Suzanne"
V80,Sandon Manor,"To Holly, Louise, Tom & Kate, wow, what can we say but the biggest thank you for the best day of our lives! When we viewed the beautiful venue over two years ago we just knew instantly Sandon Manor was the one, not just because it’s stunning, but you guys are amazing! Thank you for making all our wedding dreams come true. Forever grateful and can’t wait to return to reminisce. Lots of love, the new Mr & Mrs Jakes xxx"
V80,Sandon Manor,"From the moment we visited Sandon Manor we knew this would be our wedding venue for 9 September 2023. Seeing the spectacular finish of the house carry through to the completed venue just shows the high level of attention to detail this venue had to offer.

Holly, Tom and the rest of the team filled us with confidence right from our first interactions, annd went above and beyond on the wedding weekend itself to facilitate us, our suppliers and guests. The main house, dovecote, annex and extensive grounds were a wonderful way to have close family stay with us on site, and so handy to be able to all get ready nearby the morning of.

Thank you for making our wedding weekend a truly memorable occasion, for us and our families. We all look back on this day with the happiest, sunniest memories and Sandon Manor will always have a very special place in our hearts."
V80,Sandon Manor,"We had the most amazing wedding weekend at Sandon Manor.

The venue itself is the perfect backdrop for a wedding, our photos looked amazing from every single angle. There were so many spaces to make use of throughout the day which helped things to run incredibly smoothly and meant we didn’t need to have a ‘turnaround’ during the evening. The spaces really wowed our guests and created such a lovely atmosphere. Including the ‘club room’ dance floor that had our guests dancing until the very last song!

We stayed at the Manor House for the weekend, extending our wedding into a perfect weekend retreat. The house itself is beautiful, with lots of different areas for everyone to relax, and the perfect peaceful location to chill the night before the big day!

From our first viewing to checking out the day after our wedding, the Sandon staff were attentive, friendly and helped us feel relaxed and looked after throughout an otherwise overwhelming process. We’d highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for a beautiful, peaceful and unique wedding venue!"
V81,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Thank you so much to the entire team for making our wedding so special! Thanks to Donique, MJ, Mo, Harry and everyone else for helping us organise our day and for their professional but friendly attitude. Merchant Taylors is such a beautiful venue and offers a brilliant layout and different spaces to make the day so special!"
V81,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you all so very much for such an amazing wedding on Saturday. You all worked tirelessly to make it so special. Everything was truly wonderful and you all did me proud! Both Hugh and I couldn’t have asked for anything more in terms of being so well looked after. Our guests were so impressed and have given us so many compliments on a brilliantly well run event. Thank you all again for playing a brilliant part in our truly wonderful day of which we loved every minute
V81,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you so much for the most wonderful wedding reception at the end of April. We had the perfect day and our guests all commented on how well looked after they has been. Thank you again for all your hard work!
V81,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"We know this is very late (we have no excuse), but we wanted to say thank you for everything you and the team at Merchant Taylor's did for us on our wedding day. All the guests have since told us how much they loved the venue, food and service. Fingers crossed you get a few couples getting in touch! Again, Thank You for everything!"
V81,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"My brother and I attended the wedding today, as Florist's for the wedding party.
We were treated fantastically well by ALL the staff that we met, nothing was too much trouble and they made our task a COMPLETE pleasure.
If this is how they treat the actual wedding party then you will have a unforgettable time. Many thanks to all the staff for helping us to do our job with ease ."
V81,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Zara,

Can we thank you and your team at Merchant Taylor’s Hall for all your hard work in making Caroline and Neil’s recent wedding so very special. You, in particular, were able to deal with every question and request in a really professional manner.

Merchant Taylors’ Hall is part of the rich panoply of history and tradition, which makes this great City. All of our guests, and in particular those from abroad, were totally spell bound by the atmosphere, the food and service.

James was superb in organising the whole operation. To turn the Great Hall from a wedding ceremony hall to a banqueting suite for 110 guests, including flowers, place settings and dance floor in ninety minutes was truly remarkable.

The food and wine was of an amazing standard, we know that Merchant Taylors’ Hall has a reputation for presenting some of the finest dining in the City of London. You certainly surpassed all expectations.

We have many wonderful memories of the 10th September 2016, but it is best summed up by our daughter Caroline, “Can we do it all over again?”."
V82,Garden Museum,I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate everything that you did to make our party such a success last Friday. It was brilliant being outside on such a lovely everning. Everyone was very impressed with the venue.
V82,Garden Museum,"Thank you for all your help, advice and on-the-day support, it really made our wedding very special and it certianly went off without a hitch! The Museum looked amazing and the garden was perfect, especially as the sunshine adn the guests wanted to make the most of the beautiful surroundings."
V83,Clearwell Castle,"Can’t tell you how wonderful the team were at Clearwell. Our wedding coordinator Phaedra was exceptional. Attention to detail and everyone of the team from front of house, waiting staff, groundsmen and the DJ made our day absolutely everything we dreamed of and unique to us.

Can’t recommend highly enough and cost was outstanding value for money.

So many our guest commented on the quality of the food and that it was the best wedding they had been too! The children loved the magic of the castle and opportunity to get outside and see the grounds.

The grooms family had a fabulous time staying in the cottages the night before and our guests at both the Castle & the Wyndham had a fabulous stay on the night of the wedding.

Wish we could do it all again!"
V83,Clearwell Castle,We had our wedding at Clearwell in June and we couldn’t recommend it highly enough. From start to finish everything was perfect and they went above and beyond to ensure we had an amazing day. I’d not hesitate in recommending them to any couples. Just a gorgeous place with staff that really care in making your day all that you hope it will be.
V83,Clearwell Castle,"From the moment we first visited Clearwell, we knew this was the venue for us. From the moment we started planning to the final touches on the day, all the staff were fantastic. Ann, our wedding coordinator, was a delight to work with throughout. Nothing was too much trouble and she kept us updated throughout. The day was tailored exactly to our needs and when we arrived at the venue on the day they had prepared everything perfectly.

We did the night before package which included rooms and food the evening before. We were supplied with so much food no one went hungry. The rooms in the Wyndham and the Castle are fantastically appointed.

The venue itself is gorgeous. The cellar bar downstairs adds a whole different dimension to the occasion where you can really let your hair down.

This was an absolute dream come true venue for us. We loved every single minute."
V83,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot fault this venue at all. We initially had to change our wedding date because of lockdown and they were so supportive and empathetic.
Ann, our coordinator, is quite possibly the loveliest person on the planet. She was always happy to answer any questions and it never felt like we were being a nuisances or asking a silly question.
On the morning of the wedding she was a lovely calm presence and the whole day just ran like clockwork.
The food was out of this world with many guests saying it was the best food they’d had at a wedding and one person actually thought we’d hired a Michellin Chef!
The venue is so so beautiful with plenty of space. The downstairs cellar was a great place to party the night away, it was like an exclusive nightclub. There were lots of quieter rooms for people who wanted some peace.
The DJ was brilliant, we forgot to give a list of songs we liked but he did a great job of guessing what we liked ( he must’ve looked at our age and figured nineties dance music was our era. And he was bang on the money)
I do not have a single complaint about this venue"
V83,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot speak highly enough about Clearwell Castle as a wedding venue. The venue itself is absolutely stunning. It rained on our wedding day but the indoor space was so vast and beautiful that ourselves and our guests still had the most amazing time! Our wedding co-ordinator, Phaedra, was absolutely incredible, both before and during the wedding. She was always so professional, replied to all of my emails (there were many) and answered all queries efficiently. On the day, we genuinely could not have managed without her. The day flowed so well with her guidance and it really helped me as the Bride as I felt I didn't need to worry about anything! All the other staff at Clearwell and at the Wyndham hotel were also so wonderful! Everyone worked so hard and every member of staff was so kind to us; it just made our day incredibly special and we are so appreciative to them all. The food was great, service very quick and all the guests really enjoyed it! We had so many compliments about the staff and venue! I honestly could not recommend Clearwell castle more as a wedding venue!"
V83,Clearwell Castle,"Our wedding on 10/11/23 was just the absolute perfect day from start to finish. Our wedding planner manager, Hannah, was incredible, not just on the day but throughout the whole planning process. She ensured everything ran smoothly on the day, sparing no details ensuring everything was just perfect and to time but without being stressful. She was very accommodating with the planning meetings working around both mine and my now Husband's shift patterns.
We both stayed the night before our wedding and the night of the wedding with many of our guests travelling a distance so also staying in the Wyndham which was very convenient. Staying in Keepers cottage with the Bridesmaids the night before added to the experience with the added feature of the hot tub, the groomsmen were very jealous. The beds were very comfortable and everyone was excited to stay in a castle.
On the day of the wedding, the staff were very accommodating moving the bridal party along to the bridal suite to finish preparations earlier than originally planned. The breakfast provided was the perfect amount for a busy morning getting ready. Everything, including the gardens, were immaculately kept adding to the WOW factor of getting married in a Castle.
The canapes served and welcome drinks were well received by the guests and ourselves whilst we had photographers prior to the wedding breakfast. The food was phenomenal and great portions and I was stuffed after. The staff were very accommodating for us with a lot of people with allergies, dislikes of mushrooms so adapting the menu for these individual people. We were even able to swap out a few bottles of wine included in our package for cocktails as us as the Bride and Groom did not drink wine.
As soon as we walked in the venue the first time, we knew it was the place we wanted to get married. Everytime we went back to view the venue again I fell more and more in love. For anyone thinking about viewing or even booking this incredible venue I would say do it! We will be going back for events in the future to relive the best day of our lives."
V83,Clearwell Castle,"We got married at Clearwell castle April 2023. What can I say it's the most perfect venue and we had the most amazing day. The organisation was amazing and the staff were great on the day and even leading up to the big day. Phaedra was our wedding planner and communication with her was great throughout and on our wedding day she ensured that it all ran smoothly. I cannot recommend Clearwell castle and their staff enough. Thank you again for helping us have our dream wedding.
Kind regards

V83,Clearwell Castle,"We had the most amazing wedding day on the 24th of November 2023, the whole day ran so smoothly and all our guests absolutely loved the venue. The food was amazing and our guests loved the fish and chip buffet in the evening! The whole progress of planning the wedding was so straight forward and Phedera was a great wedding manager."
V83,Clearwell Castle,"Clearwell Castle exceeded all our expectations for our wedding day. The moment we stepped onto the grounds, we were captivated by its timeless charm. The staff, especially Hannah, went above and beyond to make every detail perfect, ensuring a seamless and stress-free experience. The Ball Room, where we exchanged our vows, felt like something out of a storybook. The surrounding gardens provided a stunning backdrop for photos and added to the overall enchantment of the day. Our guests were equally impressed, and many commented on the unique and romantic atmosphere. Choosing Clearwell Castle was the best decision we made for our special day; it truly felt like a fairy-tale come to life."
V83,Clearwell Castle,"We had the perfect wedding at Clearwell Castle, their team were superb in providing planning assistance from the point of our booking, guidance on all aspects of our wedding choices from registrars and suppliers, and coordination on the day of the wedding to make sure it flowed seamlessly. It was a beautiful day, and we couldn't be happier with our choice of Wedding location."
V84,Inner Temple,We got married here in 2023. Everything was perfect and the team made sure the day/food etc was just as we wanted it. Particular thanks to Priya and Eva (Pegasus) for their hard work making our wedding day and lead up so special.
V85,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"I got married at Dodford Manor in February this year. A great time was had by all and I will be recommending the venue to any friends planning weddings.

The weather was bad on the day so we didn’t get to use the outside area very much, but it didn’t matter as the inside is so lovely.

Sky was really helpful and put me at ease on the day. Questions in the lead up and on the day were answered quickly and I was made to feel like the only bride in the world!"
V85,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford was the first venue we looked at shortly after we got engaged. The staff were friendly and relaxed when we had a tour, I knew it was the place for us! I think Lydia telling my now husband that we couldn’t have fireworks due to the animals nearby but we could have a fire performer outside, sold the deal for us! I got an amazing fire performer as a surprise for my husband and the guests after we had sparklers, and it just completed an amazing day!
We heard such positive things Dodford about how professional and smooth running weddings have been from our suppliers, and you guys didn’t disappoint. You handled the day so well, we didn’t worry about a thing and just enjoyed ourselves the whole day.
We honestly had so many lovely messages and conversations after our wedding about how the venue was amazing, everything and everyone was catered for, from my 88 year old Nan, to young children who could play and enjoy the outdoors with a scoop of amazing ice cream. We honestly couldn’t have asked for a better day, we would do it again in a heartbeat if we could! Thank you for making the day so seamless! We are eternally grateful to everyone at Dodford for making our dreams come true becoming Mr and Mrs Price!"
V85,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford Manor what an incredible venue, from initial enquiry to booking, Dodford and the staff were so accommodating and well organised. Nothing was ever too much trouble, even if emails were being sent at 11pm. The day itself, wow it was absolutely incredible, as our wedding was on a budget and due to small numbers Dodford were amazing at setting out our decorations, everything was absolutely perfect and a special shout out to Kayleigh who was amazing on our wedding day. She kept us on time, always checking we were okay and just such a lovely person and really made our day perfect. Would highly recommend a Dodford to any couple due to be married they make the planning and the day an absolute dream and we want to relive it over again."
V85,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"It goes without saying that Dodford is a fab venue.... stunning set up, well maintained, clean, perfect grounds etc... but the best thing about Dodford is the team! I had super high expectations of any wedding venue I booked as I used to run a wedding venue myself (potential nightmare client 😂).... from the 1st viewing the team were fantastic. Relaxed, stress free, organised, professional, knowledgeable, flexible but mostly importantly friendly which gave me complete confidence in them delivering my perfect day.
In the run up to the big day the team are super responsive on email and phone We didn't meet our Event Manager, Lydia, until the day but I was always confident that they work as a whole team and therefore having 1 point of contact was not necessary at all.
In the day Lydia was amazing! Still relaxed and professional and the whole day ran so smoothly. Every requirement was perfect, on time, delivered exceptionally.
We had the best day, thank you to the whole team (especially Lydia!)

V85,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We honestly can’t say thank you enough for how amazing Dodford Manor Barn was, along with all the incredible staff who helped make our day truly unforgettable.

From the moment we visited, we fell in love with the beautiful landscapes, open-plan barns, and stunning large windows that flooded the space with natural light. The venue package was one of the best we saw during our search—it felt like everything we could possibly need was covered.

The team at Dodford Manor Barn were incredibly friendly and supportive throughout the entire planning process. Communication was open and consistent, which made everything feel so much more manageable and stress-free. We were even able to find all of our wonderful vendors through Dodford Manor Barn, which was a huge bonus!

As a bride who suffers from anxiety, I was unwell on the morning of the wedding. But I have to give special thanks to Kayleigh and our vendors, who were absolutely amazing and supported me through every step—they helped me feel calm, cared for, and ready to enjoy the day.

Our guests couldn’t stop talking about how stunning the venue was and how lovely the food turned out. We were also lucky enough to have sunshine all day, topped off with a beautiful sunset in the evening—it truly felt magical.

Thank you again, Dodford Manor Barn, for being such a perfect place to start our next chapter.

With love,
Carter & Emmie (24.03.2025) x"
V85,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"From the moment we booked our wedding at Dodford Manor, we knew we were in good hands—but nothing could have prepared us for just how extraordinary the experience would be. Every single detail was handled with such precision, care, and genuine warmth that it truly felt like a dream come to life.

The venue itself is breathtaking, but what made our day unforgettable was the impeccable service. The entire team operated like a well-oiled machine, making sure everything ran smoothly while keeping the atmosphere joyful and stress-free. Their attention to detail was second to none—no request was too big or too small.

We want to give a heartfelt, special shoutout to *Lydia*, our incredible Wedding Manager. From our first meeting to the final dance, she was nothing short of amazing. Lydia went above and beyond at every turn—anticipating needs before we even voiced them, coordinating flawlessly with suppliers, and offering support with a calming confidence that put us completely at ease, (apart from making me cry the second I saw her! 😂). Her passion for what she does shone through in every interaction, and our day would not have been the same without her.

Thanks to this amazing venue and its phenomenal team (especially Lydia!), we were able to truly enjoy every moment of our wedding, knowing everything was in the best possible hands. If you're considering this venue for your big day—don’t hesitate. It’s everything you hope for, and more.

We want to do it over and over!
A day we will NEVER forget!!

Thank you again and all our Love,
Mr & Mr Pargeter-Prince
Rowan & Karl xx"
V85,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We booked Dodford Manor in Feb 2024 after we viewed the space, for our wedding in March 2025. It was the only venue we viewed, but instantly fell in love with the character and variety of spaces the venue had to offer. The free corkage also really appealed to us as a great way for us to bring our own drinks at a good cost.

From start to end, the team were amazing, helping us with the planning of the day and making sure we had a great array of suppliers we could work with. The live band was a huge part of our day, and Dodford have a great mixture of acts on their supplier list.

On the day of the wedding, the groomsmen arrived at the venue to help with set up to see that our amazing event manager, Kayleigh had every single aspect of the day in hand and sorted. She sorted all table settings, decor, stationary - Everything!! Nothing was too much to ask of her and the Dodford team. The day ran impeccably well, with everything being on time and everything we asked for being sorted. Our drinks were served chilled, on time and were always around. It’s easy for venues who offer free corkage to try and limit you drinking your own drink - Not here!! There was constantly beers being topped up, wine bottles replaced and aperol spritz being taken round. Cannot fault them!

The team packed all of our bits away and ready for us to collect the next morning. We are very aware Dodford is a busy venue and wanted to make sure we wasn’t just “another wedding” but at no point was that the case. We felt like we were the one and only wedding and genuinely could not ask for more!

Thank you so so much for everything, Highly recommended!!"
V85,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We got married her a month ago today and had the most amazing day with them. Jess, Jack and the team made sure that everything ran smoothly and that they were doing everything they could for us on the day. We would 100% recommend them for anyone wishing to marry in such a beautiful setting."
V85,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We had been apprehensive booking Dodford for our reception that it was so popular in Northamptonshire that our wedding could end up looking the same as a lot of others we knew of, as we're local - but that was a ridiculous thing to worry about! The level of flexibility/customisation you get with Dodford is unmatched in our opinion; as it's such a beautiful venue to start with, you don't have to work hard to make it look good before adding in your personality as a couple!

The whole process from enquiries to final planning and the execution on the day were great. We did have a slight issue with them not inviting us to a food tasting in enough time before our wedding date (whether they forgot/we were missed off a list we don't know) but when we did raise it they invited us to a tasting at their sister venue instead (it's 2 hours away but we were available to travel thankfully). Every member of staff we encountered in our experience with Dodford were so friendly and make you feel like you are the only couple that matters for them in that moment, which we really appreciated from such a popular/busy venue. Abbie was our Event Manager on the day and provided such an elevated level of service, nothing was too much trouble and she executed our plans/vision to a tee, adding in some extra details that we loved too.

Our wedding was in December 2024, and we only had our reception at Dodford, so the ceremony barn was set up for our drinks reception with plenty of space for guests without it feeling cramped or equally like we were all rattling around in there (we had 75 guests for our reception). They don't have many photos of indoor drinks receptions in their promo so I was a little worried how it would look but the team had it set up beautifully. We also had a brass band on the mezzanine level which was really fun and festive!

What sold Dodford for us was the no daytime corkage, which meant we could really personalise our drinks reception and wedding breakfast drinks without breaking the bank. There was a slight disconnect with how and when we had requested/planned to serve some of the drinks in our planning meeting and what happened on the day, which we think may have been a slight hiccup in communication between Dodford and Jenkinsons (the caterers), but it didn't have a negative impact on our day at all!

Overall, there's a reason this is such a popular venue - it is truly perfect!"
V85,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,Dodford manor is an amazing wedding venue. From the very beginning when we first stepped into the venue to look around we fell in love. We knew we had to have our wedding there. After booking the venue we had amazing contact with the staff from booking our food tasting session. To a general email to see how our wedding planning was going. The planning meeting was well organised and we were able to talk through exactly what we wanted and no want was too big for the team.
V86,Gosfield Hall,"I never imagined my wedding would be somewhere as stunning as Gosfield hall but from the minute we saw this venue we knew it was the one for us and didn't bother viewing anymore venues as we had already made our minds up about having our wedding here! We were absolutely blown away with the natural beauty of Gosfield hall and so booked two years in advance of our wedding day! The professionalism and advice we received from Linda was super helpful and informative on the run up to our wedding as there is soo much to think about! We loved that we could have our day and evening all in one place aswell as the option weather permitting to have our wedding ceremony outside. I'm pleased to say the weather was absolutely perfect on our wedding day and we got to have our fairytale wedding outside! The package we paid for was well worth the money! Our guests were absolutely spoilt on our day and have all said it was the best wedding they've ever been too! It was amazing to have our guests stay over aswell! Jocie our wedding planner was absolutely amazing! She was sooo friendly and super accommodating and went above and beyond on our day to make it absolutely perfect with no hiccups! She even helped dress me on the day as she knew how to do up a corset dress and my mother didn't have a clue lol she made all my wedding details and decorations come to life and done such a stunning job decorating our dream venue aswell as being super supportive towards me my family and guests! The honeymoon suite is the best we've ever seen and completely took ours and our guests breaths away! Mind blowing! The food,venue,grounds,accomodation and night before accomodation were absolutely stunning and we want to thank everyone at Gosfield hall for making our day soo incredible and special and a day we and our guests will never forget! We can't wait to return to Gosfield! Thank you everyone at Gosfield what an amazing place!"
V86,Gosfield Hall,"We had previously experienced Gosfield Hall as a guest before deciding on it for our anniversary.

Our day was beautiful and went according to plan. Our guests all had great feedback about the day.

The only thing we would have changed would have been more diverse menu for the main meals."
V86,Gosfield Hall,"Gosfield hall is a beautiful location for a wedding and their packages cover all the important stuff! We didn’t have to worry about caterers, wedding coordinator or a DJ - all included! Great service, lovely food and everyone really enjoyed the day! Our coordinator Jocie was fab on the day, getting everything organised and fetching anything we needed. Couldn’t have asked for better, she knew the time line and the day flowed really smoothly!"
V86,Gosfield Hall,"We got married at Gosfield Hall and everything about it was perfect from when we arrive to view it, booking, the communication and Faye Carter our wedding Coordinator! If you want the best wedding day with no hassle, Gosfield is your place!!"
V86,Gosfield Hall,"Myself and my Wife have just got married at Gosfield Hall,
Our expensive started when we viewed the venue and we first met Linda sales manager, she welcome us in & made us feel at home, we wasn’t sure how, but she made us feel calm like this was where we was meant to be.
Once we looked around at all the venue has to offer we had already made a decision as this is such a stunning location and instantly new this was what we wanted! It was just right for us.

We did not get made to feel pressured to make any decisions immediately however we did end up booking our big say within the next few days after our visit.

Our next contact was with Ellie our wedding planner, she was very helpful and nothing was ever to much, we enjoyed the food tasting at the venue and was very impressed with the experience, it was out of this world.
Ellie helped us through all of our problems and made sure all of our plans come to life.

Now on our big day, what can I say? The staff were amazing, Ellie couldn’t have done enough every time you wanted to ask a question she was next to us any time we needed something. She was there all the way through the day/ night & even the next morning, Ellie made our day Run seamlessly.
We’ve been to many weddings before but never have we had food as amazing as we did here.
Every guest was amazed at the food quality and commented on how delicious it was!
Just to sum up if you’re thinking about booking your wedding at Gosfield Hall don’t question it just book it. You will be amazed."
V86,Gosfield Hall,"The venue is stunning and was the perfect setting for our winter wedding (so much natural light even in January). Jocie Golbourn was our assigned wedding planning specialist and she is so kind, sweet, patient and professional. All our guests loved the venue but many actually commented on how flawless and seamless the day was organised and rooms decorated and prepared from each section of the wedding and we only have Jocie and venue staff to thank for their meticulous planning and preparations. The food and drinks were delicious. Couldn’t recommend this venue enough- we actually booked the venue on a whim and were SO happy when we visited for an open day. There’s no false advertisements- it’s stunning."
V86,Gosfield Hall,"Everything, from start to finish, was exactly what we wanted and more. The preparation was helped by our wonderful personal manager, Tara, and accommodated each and every one of our requests and needs. The venue is gorgeous, food delicious, and atmosphere felt special. Our friends and family all told us that this was such a spectacular wedding for them that it was the best they've ever been to. We felt completely taken care of, kept us calm and happy throughout the day, and kept all of our suppliers in place and to standard. It felt glamourous and unique. We wish we could relive the day over and over. It really was our dream wedding."
V86,Gosfield Hall,"We got married in Gosfield Hall in May and had the most amazing wedding day that any couple could ask for. The whole experience from the arrival the night before to leaving the day after was seamlessly managed by the team at the venue.
The house and the grounds looked absolutely stunning and Ellie and the team did a brilliant job at keeping the day running smoothly without making anyone feel rushed. Everyone there was immensely friendly and helpful and we really felt that everyone who worked there was invested in making our day feel special.
We fell in love with the venue when we booked it but the whole experience exceeded out expectations so much that we wish we could do it all again!"
V86,Gosfield Hall,"I wanted to take a moment to commend and state our appreciation for Jocie. She truly was phenomenal, approachable and no task was too big.
We had 5 months to plan our wedding and we loved every moment. With us both working in the service industry it was great to have someone who was so switched on and would be an asset to have on any team."
V86,Gosfield Hall,"Having just got married at Gosfield Hall I can honestly say it was the most beautiful venue and the most perfect day. The staff were so attentive and professional. The food was outstanding and the drinks and cocktails were fabulous. They couldn’t do enough to make sure our day was everything we’d dreamt of. I have to say a special thanks to Ellie - one of the wedding coordinators on site - she went above and beyond to help us plan our day and was there from the very moment I woke up delivering fresh pastries for breakfast to the moment she made me a cup of tea to go to bed with. I can’t thank you enough Ellie, you are an absolute credit to Gosfield Hall."
V87,Kingston Estate Totnes,"When I first enquired with Kingston I thought it would be too expensive but we explained what are budget was and when we wanted to get married and they put a quote together that was affordable.
We have just had the most amazing one day wedding which didn't finish until the early hours. We got married in the Long Barn where there are chandeliers running down the middle, it was very romantic. There is this nightclub at Kingston which is very cool which everyone loved. The guests all said the venue was stunning and the food was out of this world.
A few of us stayed the night before and most of our guests stayed the night of the wedding in the cottages and barns. The staff were brilliant and they coordinated the whole day for us. I cant recommend the venue enough."
V87,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had a two day wedding at the Kingston Estate. All our guests were completely blown away by it.
Most of our friends and family had traveled far for the weekend and were not disappointed when then arrived as the cottages and barns are gorgeous. Some even have hot tubs.
Jodie and the Weddings Team organised a welcome party for the first night which was unreal along with providing street style food for everyone around 8.30 pm. At Kingston they have this really cool enormous Yurt and food hut which is used the day before the wedding and for breakfast.
On the wedding day itself we got married in the Walled Garden and there were endless canapes during the drinks reception. We then decided to eat in the Hayloft Barn which has glass windows overlooking all the gardens.
We used the clear span marquee for our reception party and had the craziest cover band before we all went into the nightclub until 3 am. The good thing about Kingston is everything is included they let you use things like cake stands, easels, knifes, speakers, microphones, all furniture at no extra cost, they set everything up for you and then clean up afterwards. We didn]t have to do anything which made everything totally stress free.

Thank you Jodie, Ellie and Charlotte it was insane !!"
V87,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had the most magical wedding at Kingston. From the moment we set foot onto the grounds, we knew it was the perfect place for our special day. It was our first viewing… and nothing else compared for us (we saw a total of 6 venues). What stood out to us the most was the variety of spaces available for each part of the day. The selection of ceremony areas, the beautiful outdoor spots for photos, the yurt for the night before party, and a special one for us… the underground nightclub for the evening! As party lovers, this was a part that sold it for us; there was somewhere for every moment.

One of the things we loved most was the flexibility to personalize every aspect of our wedding. The venue truly felt like a blank canvas that we could transform into our dream setting, but equally, we got away with doing absolutely nothing as it was beautiful all on its own.

But what truly made our experience unforgettable was the incredible staff, led by Jodie. They were not only professional and attentive but also genuinely warm and welcoming. Their support and attention to detail ensured that everything ran smoothly, allowing us to relax and fully enjoy our day.

We're hoping to return and stay in the future, for a special occasion.

It's not just a wedding venue; it's a place that holds a special spot in our hearts as the backdrop to the beginning of our happily ever after 🤍"
V87,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Kingston was perfect. Despite a rainy start, the day was amazing and Jodie was available but subtly in the background allowing the day to be ours."
V87,Kingston Estate Totnes,"After over a two and a half year wait due to Covid, our son and his wife had a wonderful wedding weekend. Jodie from Kingston Estate and her team of staff went above and beyond to ensure the wedding ran smoothly. Every detail was dealt with professionally. The accommodation, venue and food were all excellent and all our guests many from overseas had a wonderful time. The only thing Jodie could not oversee was the weather but even a little rain didn't spoil the celebrations."
V87,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue and staff were brilliant from start to finish. The venue is really multi-functional and caters for rain or shine. The weather was really unpredictable around the time of our wedding but I was a stress free bride knowing they had it in hand. The food supplier was stunning - we had a weekend package which all the guests raved about. That coupled with the unlimited drinks pages made it the perfect venue for us. A Devon treasure that feels like being on a film set - everyone loved it!
V87,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Such a beautiful venue - we loved it so much. The food was incredible and despite having a changeover of wedding planner close to the wedding day, it had no impact on our day what so ever. The venue are calm and professional and loved their approach to communication which was friendly."
V87,Kingston Estate Totnes,Fell in love with the venue on our first visit. We were particularly looking for a venue which could cater us for 3 days and sleep the majority of the the guests. The grounds were well kept especially the walled garden which is where the ceremony took place. The team were a pleasure and made the day truly special.
V87,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Our 3-day wedding celebrations were spent at the STUNNING Kingston Estate - a truly unique venue that we absolutely fell in love with. It had EVERYTHING we were looking for & more. The grounds are perfectly manicured all year round & come complete with walled garden. The cottages & main house are beautifully decorated, providing luxurious accommodation for 86 of our guests. Sarah & the team were such a pleasure to work with & couldn’t do enough for us. The catering was also top notch. Thank you"
V87,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue was great we had a few personal health issues beforehand but the team went above and beyond to make the day extra special. The wedding planner organised everything for us and they had plenty of props on site that we were free to use. We had the whole place to ourselves for the weekend it was brilliant and our friends loved the hot tub and pool.
V88,Holmewood Hall,"We were married at Holmewood Hall on 15th February 2025 and I can honestly say that it was the most magical day. We went to visit the venue and instantly fell in love with it but even we were blown away by how beautiful everything looked on the day. All of the staff were amazing - special shoutout to our personal wedding manager, Laura Pike, who was always on hand to answer any questions - she couldn’t do enough for us! The food was wonderful & we had full control over the menu. Would highly recommend this venue, you won’t regret it!"
V88,Holmewood Hall,"Holmewood Hall was an absolutely perfect wedding venue. The house is stunning, well cared for and beautifully decorated. All of the staff are so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Our Wedding Coordinator was fantastic, available from early morning of the wedding and was still there the morning after working for us. The food was excellent, drinks and canapes were amazing and the venue took care of everything for us. We had the most perfect wedding and are so pleased we chose Holmewood Hall. The Gold Room where we had our ceremony is gorgeous. Thank you for giving us a beautiful wedding!"
V88,Holmewood Hall,"I cannot fault this venue at all, the venue itself is breathtakingly beautiful with magnificent rooms and very lovingly maintained grounds. The staff are incredibly friendly, professional and efficient, our wedding coordinator Lee was a pleasure to work with and made our special day run smoothly. If you want a hassle free wedding with breathtaking grounds and the most amazing staff then this is the venue for you."
V88,Holmewood Hall,"Had the most amazing wedding here recently and cannot recommend it enough.

The venue itself is stunning and the options included in the luxe package covered everything we could've possibly wanted and made planning the wedding 100x less stressful.

The staff were all amazing from start to finish, Katie showed us around initially and then Lee was our personal wedding manager, and they were both incredible throughout. Always on hand to answer any questions and help us through the day once we got there.
We had so many comments from our guests on how lovely the staff were on the day!

A particular highlight though was the food - the tasting evening was a dream and the chef went above and beyond to provide a full vegan menu for us which wasn't limited to only a couple of options.
Again, we had so many non-vegan guests complimenting the food and saying how lovely it was!

Overall, an incredible day and an incredible venue.
Thank you so much to everyone there!"
V88,Holmewood Hall,"This place is simply just amazing 🤩
We had our wedding here on 17-12-24 and it was everything we dreamed of and more. The food, staff, decor were just perfect not forgetting the most beautiful Christmas tree 😍
Our person wedding planner Lee was an absolute god send not just having him there on the day but always being at the end of a phone to answer any questions or worry’s.
If we could go back and do it all again we would and not change a single thing.
The most perfect day at the most perfect venue ♥️"
V88,Holmewood Hall,Perfect venue for a wedding with guest numbers 60 - 100. Our guests and I moved from each room to a new room throughout the day and every room had a new surprise. The bridal suite was lush and it was great having all our guests staying under one roof. I would 100% recommend this to anyone.
V88,Holmewood Hall,"The wedding day and lead up to the day were fab. However, for the price we paid, we expected a little bit more.
I opted to use the bridal cottage the evening before for which we paid £450 extra. This is something I now regret, as there was no hot water and we were not able to order any food in as all the take away options were shut (on a Friday night). The hot tub also needed a good clean. So the night before/morning of my wedding was not ideal. I flagged this to the manager who advised that we should have raised the cold water issue as soon as possible, but seeing as we were trying to have morning showers on the wedding day, this did not leave us any time.
Our package included pre-drinks, wine with dinner and we also purchased a cocktail ""cart"" (cocktails on a table) and a bucket of beers. The groom, who is not a wine fan, asked for a beer with his wedding meal and was presented with a contactless card machine to pay for it at the top table. We felt this was a bit unnecessary as there was a full bucket of extra beers outside and it felt a little embarrassing having a card machine presented to us at the top table on our wedding day for one measly Corona, despite the huge amount we had paid. Also, guests were unknowingly allowed to buy beers from the bar after the meal, despite there being available beers to them already in a bucket next to the bar...
Overall the wedding was lovely, but for the price we paid we expected a bit better. Essentially, I loved the venue, but I wish we had not purchased any extras!"
V88,Holmewood Hall,"We got married at Holmewood Hall on 4th October 2024. From the first moment we stepped into the venue and I saw the magnificent Gold room I knew this would be the perfect place for us to get married. We had the most amazing day which was perfectly coordinated by the whole team at Holmewood but especially so by our personal wedding manager Lee. Lee was always quick to respond to any questions we had in the lead up to the day and nothing was too much trouble for him.
We honestly wish we could do it all over again as it was a magical day. We would recommend Holmewood Hall to anyone looking for the perfect venue."
V88,Holmewood Hall,"After getting engaged in late March this year we wanted to get married fairly quickly so booked Holmewood for the same September. The venue, grounds, accomodation were all stunning and we felt very fortunate it was within budget and the package we got was outstanding in comparison to other venues and what it included, which was far far more than other venues. We got to attend a luxe event to choose all our wedding food, canapés, cocktails and wines which should have made things easier but due to the unbelievable quality it made it harder! Our wedding planner Lee is literally the most fantastic person. He was flexible, fun, engaged and on absolutely everything. The day was ran impeccably and also smooth even with some weather concerns and speeches taking a bit longe than we thought. If you book here ask for Lee!! We had the most perfect day. Can’t fault a single things. Our guests all told us how incredible everything was with one even saying he will now longer not attend any further weddings unless it’s at Holmewood. Thank you to all the staff and as mentioned a huge special thank you to Lee! Your a legend!"
V88,Holmewood Hall,"Exceptional venue, stunning grounds, fantastic DJ, and excellent service. Highly recommended! Happiest day of my life 😊"
V89,Bourton Hall,"We got married at Bourton Hall on 08 March 2025 and our wedding planner was Harminder. The day was absolutely amazing from start to finish. All the food and drinks were of a high standard and presented beautifully which includes the wedding breakfast, canapés and cocktails, and breakfast the next day. The venue is gorgeous with lots of rooms, well maintained grounds and exclusive use. The staff are friendly and accommodating and the event was really well managed. We would like to particularly thank Harminder, who was supportive throughout the wedding planning process and the wedding day, ensuring things ran smoothly and in a timely manner. He is a great communicator, provided advice and guidance where needed and attention to detail. We really had a magical day! Thank you so much! We would happily do it all over again and would definitely recommend this venue!"
V89,Bourton Hall,"What a fabulous wedding venue! Because it's a wedding venue and not a hotel that holds the occasional wedding, they really focused on what was important and anticipated our every need. It's an elegant venue but with a comfortable feel to it. The team are incredibly accommodating and helpful and each couple is allocated their own personal wedding manager to guide them through the process and to make sure every detail is covered.
There's a beautiful chapel on site where non-religious ceremonies can be held - this was fabulous.
The food was plentiful and delicious - all our guests raved about it. Great choice of welcome drinks and canapes, wines and cocktails.
The grounds are gorgeous; a perfect backdrop for our October wedding.
The venue was exclusively ours and has beautiful bedrooms, including a huge, stunning bridal suite. Most of our guests stayed overnight and took advantage of the brilliant breakfast in the morning so it really extended the celebration."
V89,Bourton Hall,"Our wedding at Bourton Hall was better than we ever imagined. The Italianate mansion is truly spectacular inside and out however it is the team that made our day run perfectly. Our guests found the setting and the food incredible, they were very impressed! Our wedding planner Emily Sarjant was fantastic her knowledge and expertise made our day magical from start to finish, with all the special touches that she suggested. Our first dance was created in such a beautiful way it will be a memory we cherish forever. Thank you to Emily and the team at Bourton Hall. My husband would also like to note that the croquembouche was amazing and everyone should have one."
V89,Bourton Hall,"My wife and I got married at Bourton Hall in September, with our wedding managed by the wonderful Eleni. Everything about the day went as perfectly as we could've wished, right from arrival to departure the following day. The venue is stunning, and the food was lovely, and having 21 bedrooms on site was such a bonus so that all of our close friends and family could stay on site with us.
Bourton Hall did everything they could both in the run up to the day and on the day itself to alleviate all stress to ensure everything ran as seamlessly as possible, which it absolutely did.
We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall enough."
V89,Bourton Hall,"We were married on 28th July 2024. What an amazing day we had at Bourton Hall. Could not fault it! The venue is so elegant! The grounds and views were to die for. The food was out of this world with so many choices and all cooked and served to perfection. Accommodation / rooms were plentiful and luxurious. Lovely to have a chapel on site too. We had the whole place to ourselves, we felt like royalty! Lots of varied rooms and areas for people to choose where they wanted to be after the wedding breakfast. We would choose the venue all over again!"
V89,Bourton Hall,"We had both our wedding ceremony and reception at Bourton Hall and the service was superb throughout. The house and grounds are beautiful with amazing views to go with them. The staff were professional and helpful during the lead up to our wedding day and during the day as well - even when we had an emergency prior to the ceremony which caused delays, the venue staff were able to work around this to move timings back in order to allow all of our planned activities to go ahead and be fully enjoyed. All the food was delicious and we had a wonderful wedding day thanks to Bourton Hall."
V89,Bourton Hall,"We had the most perfect wedding day at Bourton Hall. Throughout the planning process and on the day, the team were so professional, which meant we could relax and know that everything was in their capable hands - Emily was an amazing wedding manager. The building is beautiful inside and out, and the grounds are stunning - there are so many places for beautiful photos, and views out over the countryside. The food was absolutely delicious, it was so hard to choose what to have! It was also so helpful to have so many places for guests to sit and chat in the evening, away from the disco room but still part of the action. Having so many bedrooms onsite (not to mention a stunning bridal suite!) was an added bonus. We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall highly enough, and have had so many comments from guests saying what a beautiful, elegant but relaxed day it was, so I know they really appreciated everything Bourton has to offer too. Thank you so much to Emily and the whole team for giving us such a perfect day!"
V89,Bourton Hall,"As the Bride and Groom we were made to feel like nothing was too much to ask and they couldn't do enough to make us feel special.
All the guests commented that it was one of the prettiest and most relaxed weddings they have been to.
We could not have asked for a better wedding day thanks to Bourton!"
V89,Bourton Hall,"I had my wedding on 10/02/2024 I am so happy I chose this venue, It is really magical. My wedding manager was just the best! Emily went above and beyond to help me on my big day! I cannot thank her enough.

One of the main things about this venue is that t has its own chappel which is really special and makes you wedding seem more traditional, however there are more options/ rooms available. I wanted the wow factor and I got it.

Some of the options that made it great

*Onsite accommodation for night before and night of the wedding is really helpful
*Exclusive use
*Dedicated wedding manager definate gamechanger! (Emily)
*Menu choices are fantastic.

Everyone commented on the food being really nice ( we had the lamb) The evening buffet was also great. I paid extra to have a meal created as having part of my culture within the food at the wedding was very important to me, they did not disappoint.
Emily was perfect in so many ways, she knew exactly my vision once i explained it to her and she made sure that it became real for me. She adapted parts of the day so that it would work better, for example bringing the canapes outside whilst photos where being taken. Helping me into my dress, looking after my phone just everything I needed she was there. She really worked hard to make sure it run perfectly and it did.

Thank you emily!!! You made my day Great."
V89,Bourton Hall,We got married at Bourton Hall on 30th July 2023. It was the most amazing day ever! We are still receiving compliments from our guests on how stunning the venue was and the whole running of the day. This was 100% down to our wedding co-ordinator Harminder. He went above and beyond to ensure our day was absolutely perfect. He literally could not have done any more! Thank you again Harminder!!
V90,B&H Buildings,Bourne & Hollingsworth was such an exceptional venue for our wedding this September. This is the perfect place for you if you want a true London wedding that feels like a fun dinner/house party but on an epic scale. We used the top floor (the studios) for our sit down dinner (think candle light and tasty roast lamb) and headed downstairs for our reception with the basement club (below and hidden) for late night dancing. The place is stunning (greenery and glass everywhere and the cocktails are insane but what really makes this place are the people. The whole staff from Matt and Lizzie to the bar team to the dinner crew made our whole day seamless and so fun. Could not recommend B&H more highly for your London wedding.
V90,B&H Buildings,"Beautiful wedding celebration in the most stylish venue - we had an intimate wedding reception (drinks, dinner and more drinks!) at the Bourne & Hollingsworth Buildings. The staff members on duty were excellent - nothing was too much trouble and they served everyone with such professionalism. We couldn’t recommend it highly enough and we haven’t stopped talking about it since. All of our guests were so impressed with the space and how stylish it was. The bar, restaurant and greenhouse are all aesthetically beautiful and the botanical vibes make for a very relaxed, but premium setting. Special shout out to Lizzie who helped us coordinate everything and Matt on the day who led the team. Thank you so much - we had the best day and we couldn’t have wished to host it in a better venue."
V90,B&H Buildings,"India & the B&H team were seamless. Flexible, responsive, kind, and easy to deal with. They made our day so special. The food was fantastic, the drinks were lovely, and the value for money was first rate!"
V91,Leez Priory,"I never in my life thought I would get married in a place like Leez priory! The whole experience from start to finish was just fantastic. The price breakdown was manageable and there was no pressure to take any upgrades offered. The things we got in our package were phenomenal and having a wedding planner was tremendous - our lady (Leanne) was an absolute god send!
They catered to all our needs and we were made to feel so comfortable and nothing was a problem! I’d highly suggest going to an event there before hand, just to get a feel of what it’s like full of people and enjoy their delicious food. We actually enjoyed their entertainer ( singer) so much we hired him for our wedding ☺️
Lee priory is just so beautiful. I can’t speak highly enough x"
V91,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory on the 7th of September 2024. Considering how long they have been a wedding venue, they were pretty flexible with some of the ideas we had for the venue styling that turned out amazingly!

The staff really made the day something special and couldn't have done enough for us. Special mention must be made for Leanne, our wedding planner, who was amazing!

Highly recommend the venue and the incredible team that helped to make our day so special!"
V91,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in October 2024. This venue is stunning both inside and out with immaculately kept grounds and interior. The hospitality in the lead up to and on the day of the wedding was fantastic. The food was also brilliant. Another great perk of this venue is the amount of on site accommodation.

A couple of drawbacks / experiences during our wedding. There are only a few toilets in the main building which kept blocking and overflowing throughout the evening which led to us taking some guests to the dressing room or honeymoon cottage to use the facilities. You are also restricted by the venue on any external food or drink suppliers and the venues optional extras for this are quite expensive for what they are.

That asaide, we had the best day and evening at Leez Priory and would certainly recommend it!"
V91,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in August 2024- great venue and experience from initial viewing to leaving the morning after the wedding. Leanne acted as our wedding planner and was friendly, professional and helpful throughout. We opted for the classic package and the food was amazing quality with everyone commenting how full they were!
The venue is beautiful with several options for ceremony both inside and out. Accommodation was great too. The whole day ran smoothly with perfect weather - we will have very happy memories of our day!"
V91,Leez Priory,"Perfect venue and very attentive staff, lovely food and great communication from start to finish"
V91,Leez Priory,"Stunning venue. Fantastic Team. Very accommodating toward our unique ""surprise"" strategy. Our guests were truly surprised. Thank you."
V91,Leez Priory,"Leez priory was the 1st and only venue we looked around when we started planning our wedding. From the moment we stepped on the premises, everything just looked so perfect and exactly what we wanted from a wedding venue. When we got assigned our wedding co-ordinator Rachel, she was just absolutely spot on with everything we asked for and nothing was too big an ask for her. She made sure the day ran as smoothly as possible and took care of any issue that arose without me knowing (which I am forever grateful for!!)
The rest of the staff were amazing and very helpful.

The venue itself is just absolutely stunning and we loved that it has the pub area as well as the dance floor so it catered to all of our guests.

All of the rooms were lovely and it was so nice being able to stay in the fisherman’s lodge onsite the night before the wedding.

We genuinely cannot recommend this venue enough and it was 100% worth the money! 10/10!"
V91,Leez Priory,"We got married on a Tuesday in October to maximise the value of what we could get for our money; and honestly, we got everything we wanted and more. Leanne, our Wedding Manager was perfect at bringing an attention to detail and seamless organisation to the big day, and in the lead up. There wasn't one moment of the day where we felt stressed, as Leanne had it covered. In one particular instance, our flowers for the bridal party's hair hadn't arrived. Within five minutes of telling Leanne that we needed this, the flowers were with our hair and make-up suppliers to add the finishing touches.

Leez Priory as a venue is the most stunning setting, and offers an incredible range of areas in which the ceremony and reception can take place. There is also the opportunity for the bridal party to make use of the Fisherman's Cottage the night before the wedding, and for people to stay in the on-site accommodation on the evening of the wedding, making it the perfect venue for people also travelling from further afield.

Leez Priory were very accommodating, welcoming and were happy to work with us to make our day as perfect as possible. The food was incredible, and a total hit with all of our guests, and so many people have commented on how incredible the day was as a whole. You wouldn't be disappointed to choose Leez Priory."
V91,Leez Priory,They catered to our every need. To when we would ask for things they hadn’t been done before they still made sure it went smoothly. Leanne was amazing she made me feel so comfortable from the start. The whole day was stunning. Beautiful venue please go view it as you will not be disappointed
V91,Leez Priory,We got married on the 26 May 2024. This venue was absolutely brilliant! They catered for every need and made sure there was no stress on the day. Leanne was kind and level headed throughout and was always one step ahead! Do not hesitate to book- do it now!
V92,London Rowing Club,"We picked this place because we wanted somewhere fairly central and casual. We fell in love with the long room and the view. Our wedding was in October so we thought we'd have it cosy but we ended up with a beautiful autumnal day so everyone was on the balcony. The fairy lights were perfect and the other rooms were great to avoid leaving. The staff was so friendly and accommodating that we would definitely recommend the venue.

The only thing that could have tainted the day is that after three visits and many emails, we were never told that the river floods (a lot). We were flexible with our day so if we knew this we would have built it into our day, instead, I was told by the photographer on the day as I got out of the taxi that we wouldn't be able to take any group photos because the area would be flooded during the cocktail hour and half that we had assigned as photo time. This would have been disappointing but we all ended up running outside after the ceremony to take photos before the tide came in. My husband and I borrowed wellies for our couple photos. We had fun doing this, but I can imagine many couples being upset! My friend's electric car also flooded and they were obviously upset."
V92,London Rowing Club,"Annabel was meticulous in her help planning the wedding. Very knowledgeable and helpful.
On the day the rest of the staff were brilliant - there wasn’t an empty glass in the house.
Great venue at a reasonable price on the London riverside."
V92,London Rowing Club,"LRC was the perfect place to celebrate our wedding this summer. The venue staff went above and beyond to ensure that everything went as planned both before and during the event. Thanks in particular to Annabel who was responsive, helpful and always put us at ease in the build up. The location is stunning - couldn’t have asked for a better day!"
V92,London Rowing Club,"We just wanted to say an enormous thank you for everything. From the moment we came to visit the LRC on a slightly grey January weekend, we knew it would be a fabulous venue for our June wedding reception and it certainly did not disappoint. It really is the most beautiful setting and we have very fond memories of our guests enjoying drinks in the sunshine with the most fantastic view over the Thames. The venue has such character and lends itself beautifully to a wedding reception. We have received so many compliments from our guests and I would encourage anyone thinking about booking their wedding at the LRC to do it, you will not regret it! We were lucky to be blessed with beautiful weather so were able to have our jazz musicians play on the balcony for the drinks reception before moving into the Long Room for our meal. It looked stunning with the tables dressed and mantles adorned with flowers. Following the meal and speeches, guests enjoyed drinks back on the balcony and in the Fairburn and Members Rooms which provide plenty of seating, whilst the Long Room was cleared and the band set up. We then partied the night away.

From start to finish, the organisation was so straight forward. Annabel was very accommodating and full of helpful advice in the run up. I knew that on the day she would ensure things ran like clock work, which of course they did. Our suppliers also commented on how helpful the LRC team were to work with. On the day the staff were brilliant and went out of their way to ensure everything ran smoothly (including borrowing some large gym fans from the rowers to put in the Long Room to keep us cool as it was an unexpectedly hot day). We really can’t thank you enough and now need to think of an excuse to host another party with you in the future!"
V92,London Rowing Club,"We got married in St. Mary's church and then had our reception in the London Rowing Club in February 2023. It far exceeded our expectations and was an incredible fabulous stress-free day with thanks to the wonderful Annabel making the day just run.

In the lead up to the event, Annabel was incredibly responsive, helpful and helped us plan the day exactly how we wanted it. She answered all our questions really quickly, always got back to us, was very flexible with what we could do and allowing us to personalise the space. Prior to the event, Annabel arranged for us to go and have a look around on a couple of additional occasions to help us plan how we would want it to look. She also gave our caterers a tour of the kitchens as they were new to the venue.

In the immediate lead up to the day, Annabel helped with our suppliers in getting chairs delivered and bringing all the wine over a day earlier. On the day, she helped to make the day flow and just dealt with things throughout the day.

The venue itself is beautiful with three rooms to use. A middle reception room, a cosy snug and the main long room. In the main long room, there is a rowing boat hanging upside down with fairly lights. The main lighting can be dimmed and gave a wonderful atmosphere for the evening meal. As our wedding was a winter wedding, it was fairly chilly so they lit fires in the main room and snug which added to the atmosphere.

We had around 90 guests - could have fitted a few more just about. We used the round tables, tablecloths, linen, plates cutlery and glasses provided and they were perfect for a wedding and looked very smart. No need to hire these. As mentioned, we did hire separate wedding chairs instead of the conference chairs provided. There's a lot of decoration in the way of rowing memorabilia on the walls which means you don't have to actually do too much to make it interesting for guests.

Overall, the perfect London wedding venue with absolutely fabulous views across the Thames with a long balcony to enjoy from. To top it off Annabel is truly amazing and so helpful."
V92,London Rowing Club,"We had our wedding (ceremony+reception) at LRC in July, and the venue itself and the team we worked with were absolutely incredible! Everything on the day went without a hitch and we heard so many compliments on the location - our guests loved the balcony and the layout inside, which included plenty of space for anyone wanting a break from dancing to sit down and relax. Would recommend to anyone looking to host an event!"
V92,London Rowing Club,"London Rowing Club is a truly fantastic venue and we were both so delighted with how our day went! The venue has real character with the classic rowing memorabilia and it’s location on the Thames, and looks amazing when it’s all set up. The layout and size of rooms I thought were perfect for our wedding of about 70 (+15ish more in the evenings) and of course the big attraction is the balcony which all of our guests adored!! (I wish I’d had more time during the day to stand out there and enjoy it 😂). Not only is it a fantastic venue in a great location but what really made this the most amazing venue was how great all of the staff, and all the recommend suppliers were! The day exceeded expectations and we got compliments on the place and the staff from all our guests. Couldn’t be happier with the venue, it was perfect for us!!"
V92,London Rowing Club,"We found the London Rowing Club while desperately combing through London locations after our original venue fell through a few months before the day.
Luckily for us it was available due to a cancellation - kismet!
From the start the charming Annabel put us very much at ease and helped us to envisage the day as we hoped it would be. She was very flexible and helpful throughout the planning process.
We were incredibly lucky with the weather on the day and the venue really came into its own - it was virtually impossible to get guests off the terrace, which is the perfect size for our smallish event (65 people) and of course offers gorgeous river views.
We were well looked after by the team and everything went off without a hitch. The interior of the space itself is lovely with a great sense of history.
Nice additional touch - table tennis was made available in the entry room for the later part of the evening!

It's a special place and I'd thoroughly recommend for anyone seeking a memorable spot to tie the knot!"
V92,London Rowing Club,"We got married at the London Rowing Club on a brilliantly sunny winter day on Saturday. All the way through in the run up (after 2 years or more of postponements), Annabel and team bent over backwards to help us arrange everything, recommended some brilliant suppliers for food (Shona Pollock comes highly recommended) and flowers (same with Steph the charityflorist.)

So many of our guests said how lovely the venue and staff were on the day, and the whole place looked a million dollars with an amazing photo set on and around the balcony and river - although we haven't seen those yet. The corkage and bar tariff prices are also incredibly reasonable for an inner London location!

I can't recommend the LRC highly enough. It will live in memory for a very long time."
V92,London Rowing Club,"The London Rowing Club team alongside the Dinner Ladies went above and beyond to ensure that we had the wedding perfectly fitting our requirements. Throughout the entire all of the suppliers worked seamlessly together to ensure the space transformed as we progressively added guests and transitioned between eating, our ceremony, more eating, music and dancing. We wouldn’t have had it any other way. The attention to detail of the team is second to none - perfect for any bride and groom seeking a beautiful event."
V93,The Prince Albert,"The team at The Prince Albert were always accommodating, made everything easy and stress-free, and helped us organise an amazing wedding party. They really knew what they were doing, and helped guide us through the process calmly, working around our schedule (which wasn't easy - we live abroad!) to make sure all our last-minute worries and concerns were sorted smoothly. The food was excellent, and the space was fantastic for our party. Can't recommend it highly enough!"
V93,The Prince Albert,"We had such a happy wedding with Harrison and this venue. Harrison was really flexible and answered any questions we had and made great suggestions when we needed seating arrangements, the schedule for the day, a florist, and more. The day was accessible to everyone and the food and drink were perfect. Thank you for making out wedding stress free and wonderful."
V93,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert was the most wonderful venue for our London wedding. We came across the venue at there wedding fair and chose alot of our suppliers from the same wedding fair.

Harrison and Lauren were always so on hand to help with any questions and did a fantastic job answering all of our questions. The staff were so friendly and helpful and made everything run like clockwork.

We couldn’t recommend The Prince Albert enough for a london wedding and would love to do it all again."
V93,The Prince Albert,"My wife and I were beyond happy with how everything went on our wedding day. Harrison, Diana, Claudio and the whole team were absolutely phenomenal! It was such a beautifully efficient operation, and we always felt like someone was there to help us when needed.

We've had dozens of compliments about the great food and how wonderfully intimate the venue was for a wedding. Some of our more traditional relatives said they were initially sceptical at the prospect of a pub wedding, but that it was one of the most beautiful and joyful weddings they’d been to. A friend of mine was also very happy that someone at the bar remembered her drink order throughout the evening! On top of that, everything ran perfectly to schedule, which is no doubt down to the high attention to detail.

It was very useful that the upstairs was free on Friday afternoon so that we could set up the space. It gave us plenty of time to do the flower arrangements, put up the bunting, and stick photos on the frame wall.

Thank you again so much for all the help and support you've given us - it really was the best day of our lives (so far)!"
V93,The Prince Albert,"My husband and I got married here in late September 2023, and I cannot recommend the Prince Albert enough!! Booking a wedding venue can be stressful and we felt like a lot of the venues we looked at gave us the ""hard sell"" but the folks at the Prince Albert helped to put us at ease every step of the way. We fell in love with how beautiful the pub was, so hired the upstairs for the ceremony, wedding breakfast and party afterwards for around 40 - 45 people. We were able to drop off decorations the night before and talk it all through with the staff, and they did such a good job of working with us and the florist to get the place looking amazing. The ceremony went off without a hitch, everybody loved the food and we had a blast in the evening. All the staff were amazing, but special shout out to Harrison and Lauren for helping us plan and run the day, and Maria for managing everything on the ground both when we dropped off the decorations and during the wedding itself. Thank you again for helping us celebrate our special day with our loved ones, for making it so stress free and so memorable!"
V93,The Prince Albert,"All you ever hear about wedding venues is that everything is a rip off, the food is meh, and there are a ton of annoying restrictions...the opposite is true of Harrison and The Prince Albert team. From Day 1, Harrison made the whole process not only easy but really fun! He was quick to respond, super knowledgeable, and very accommodating; he even helped our best man execute a surprise for us without it disrupting any timings. On the day, they decorated the place beautifully, managed to serve a 3 course dinner to 76 people unbelievably fast, and everyone raved about the food - to say they did a good job is a gross understatement, they went above and beyond. We were after ""classy fun"" and that's exactly what we got - thank you so so much!"
V93,The Prince Albert,"We had the exact wedding reception we wanted at the Prince Albert thanks to Harrison, Claudio and the other amazing staff who helped us feel so relaxed in the build up and during. We wanted a very low-key vibe and the team understood that but there were enough options for any style of wedding you wanted. The upstairs function room felt cozy and intimate while still leaving breathing room and space to dance, but you could easily rent the whole place if you wanted more guests and even choose to do your ceremony there. We had the most compliments on our food (we chose a buffet option). The team were particularly accomodating to some complicated dietary requirements and it was all delicious."
V93,The Prince Albert,"July 6, 2023 was the most memorable day of our lives! A big thank you to Harrison and the rest of the team for assisting us through out the whole process. Our guests loved the Prince Albert pub especially the sumptuous food and booze on our wedding day!

David & Dannah"
V93,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert is a Great venue for the classic Pub Wedding.
Harrison and the team did an amazing job to organize everything. The food was great and the service first class. Only sorry it was over so quickly. Thanks again for everything."
V93,The Prince Albert,"We found The Prince Albert when our original venue cancelled on us less than 2 months before our wedding. & we are so glad we did; everything happens for a reason! From the moment we met Harrison, we knew we were in safe hands, and the team at the Prince Albert made our day amazing. The pub looked beautiful and we were very greatful for the effort the team put in putting up all our decorations. We had so many compliments about the food, and we were very impressed in the swift and organised manner in whichever it was served. Everyone had a wonderful time, and we would not hesitate in recommending The Prince Albert."
V94,Kindred,"We chose Kindred for our 60 person wedding and it could not have been better. We wanted a venue where we could have the ceremony, dinner and dancing all under one roof, that was wheelchair accessible, and easy to get to on the tube, Kindred ticks all those boxes and more!
The food is incredible, we really enjoyed popping by to do all the tastings, we'll continue to come to the Cellar for food and cocktails. Many guests commented on how good the food was.
The place itself is gorgeous, inside and out. We used the whole venue, the main Hall for the ceremony, dinner and dancing, and the Library upstairs for the drinks reception and cake cutting. Also, being right next to Hammersmith station, the venue could not be easier to get to!
The staff are wonderfully attentive and helpful, both before and on the day. They were really open to the little details that made our day uniquely ours, from the drinks selections, to having a table and glasses on stage for the ceremony, to playing our music selections at the right time. Plus its a dog friendly venue!"
V94,Kindred,"We LOVE this venue! We got married here with only 12 weeks notice and Anna, the owner, and her staff went above and beyond to make the day as memorable, magical, and marvellous as we'd hoped it would be. The venue is elegant, stylish and perfect for a London, city based wedding. The food is sensational as it comes from their in-house kitchen on the ground floor and every guest remarked on how delicious their meal was. It's restaurant quality food, not your standard wedding food. The place looks stunning in all our wedding photos and the wedding cake they made us (at very short notice I might add!) was second to none. Everyone loved it. The venue was also perfect for late night dancing and drinking and merriment. It was such a pleasure - and a breeze - to work with Anna and her team on one of the most important days of my life, and I very much hope to do so again in the future. I will forever be grateful to her and all she helped us with."
V94,Kindred,"We had our wedding reception for 35 guests at Kindred, in the Library and Salon earlier this year. The day went incredibly smoothly, the staff couldn't have been more attentive and our guests raved about the food for weeks afterwards. It was the perfect sized space for our intimate celebration, really cosy and the atmosphere was great. The little touches really helped to make the day special, with espresso martinis served for the speeches and sparklers for our exit at the end of the night. Thanks again to the lovely Kindred team!"
V94,Kindred,"I cannot find a single fault in our experience with Kindred for our wedding. Not only was it a stunning venue that honestly made some of our guests gasp as they arrived, but Anna and the team were so incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. Having them support us really took so much of the wedding planning stress away and we knew we were in safe hands. I really appreciated that the team were happy to chat through ideas with me and were always keen to find creative solutions to give us the day that we had envisioned.

The food was absolutely delicious and they were so accommodating for our long list of dietary requirements from our guest. The cocktails were also so delicious. Our guests were buzzing for weeks after, as were we.

On the night, the staff were not only incredibly helpful and efficient, but also just so friendly, welcoming and complimentary. We felt thoroughly spoilt and very well looked after.

We visited so many venues and this was by far the best choice for us. The interiors made for some stunning photos and the layout of the spacing meant that whilst we had 80-100 guests, it still felt very intimate. I cannot recommend Kindred enough!"
V94,Kindred,"We would give a thousand stars if we could. Kindred hosted us for our cocktail style wedding and it was everything we could have hoped for and the perfect venue for this style of wedding. The wine, cocktails and food (incredible grazing board, canapés, bowls and pizzas) were exceptional and the team were on top of everything, friendly and nothing was ever an issue. We would HIGHLY recommend it. We have had loads of guests message us to tell us what a spectacular venue it was with the most friendly team. The venue had different spaces to suit our needs and the AV is amazing - it worked perfectly for our live music band and our DJ, and our own music playlists for our ceremony. They took the stress off planning and really did mean we could relax and not worry that everything would run smoothly. Thank you so much Kindred team for giving us the best day of our lives"
V95,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The best day of our lives and me and my now husband couldn't be more thankful to Bredenbury. Before booking Bredenbury we visited over 17 wedding venues in Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Herefordshire - we fell in love instantly, there is no need for a crazy amount of extra expense on decorations, the venue speaks for itself. The fact that it was no corkage just added to why we wanted to book and the team were so friendly. In the lead up to the wedding they were brilliant, we booked far in advance and brought over all our family members to come see the venue, they were so flexible, understanding and welcoming - they couldn't do enough for us. On the wedding day they had decorated for us by the time we had arrived and all we had to do on the day was to enjoy it - which was perfect. It really was the best day of our lives, all the comments from our family and friends was how beautiful the venue was. They kept the day running so smooth and we didn't need to think about a thing."
V95,Bredenbury Court Barns,"There truly aren't words to describe how incredible Bredenbury Court Barns and their entire team of fantastic staff were through the planning process and the day itself. They were so friendly, supportive and nothing was ever too much. From quick replies to any questions that popped to mind to planning meetings that left us feeling prepared and ready to the day being set up beyond perfectly. Our amazing wedding coordinator Lianna spent the days and months (years really!) leading up to our big day making sure everyone detail was perfect, that everything was incorporated that we'd dreamed of and made sure we didn't feel a moment of stress from start to finish. All throughout the building from the bridal booth, to the orangery to the oak barn was beautifully light and open - even with our wedding being the end of October - and we had so many compliments about this! There aren't enough words to say thank you and explain just how much we'd recommend this venue to everyone"
V95,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We had the perfect day back in July. The weather didn't go to plan but they helped make the day so special even with the last minute switches because of the rain. We had such an amazing day and the feedback from our guests about the venue, food and service was great! We cannot thank the team enough for the effort they put in throughout the whole process but especially on the day. We felt incredibly supported throughout the whole process."
V95,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The venue itself is stunning. The buildings, grounds and interior decorations are all beautiful and immaculately presented. From the moment you turn down the lane it is so picturesque, you know you've found somewhere special. It's exactly what we were imagining for our wedding venue.

The layout is perfect, with ample space for guests to mingle and move about, and great accessibility for older and disabled guests. Ours was a winter wedding, and while most of the day was inside it wasn't cramped and we could still enjoy the beautiful grounds through the expansive windows that run along the whole barn.

All of the venue is stunning, but practicality-wise the Bridal Suite warrants a special mention. Room length mirrors, plenty of room for the bridal party to get ready, have their makeup and hair done, and if there's time to relax as well. Drinks were served from 11 onwards, and it has it's own toilets and shower.

From our first meeting at Bredenbury the staff were exceptional. They gave a reassuring air of professionalism and experience, with just the right level of excitedness for our day without it feeling forced. We were really impressed by how responsive the whole team were, with speedy replies to any questions we had during the planning. This is something we particularly appreciated as we only gave ourselves 7 weeks to plan our big day.

Value for money wise it felt tricky to gauge when we were trying to choose a venue as the headline figure is rarely what you'll end up paying, with different venues charging different amounts for different things. Not the case with Bredenbury. With their No Corkage policy and generosity in being able to use whatever props they already have, any extras were non-essentials of our own choosing.

No Corkage is pretty significant. Some venues wanted to charge £20/bottle, so not having to pay this and being able to supply not only our own wine but beers, gin and soft drinks for the drinks reception and wedding breakfast was not only a massive saving but also made the occasion more personal for us. The bar staff and catering team were excellent, pouring and serving drinks, warming our mulled wine and setting up the gin bar. Once your guests have drunk you dry the venue's bar is well stocked and standard pub pricing.

We wanted a Christmas wedding and seeing in early November that they had a date available that December we couldn't resist. 7 weeks isn't long to organise a wedding with nearly 100 guests, and we couldn't have done it without the Bredenbury team being so organised. Our assigned event manager, Harriet, was brilliant in the runup and on the day, as were all the other managers and staff we spoke with. The Wedding Bible they fill out with you is a great idea and nails down all the finer details to ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible on the day.

We didn't want to have to spend the day before and morning of our wedding worrying about set up and decorations, but needn't have worried as Bredenbury did all of this for us. A meeting beforehand clarified what we wanted where; we simply dropped off boxes of stuff the day before and rocked up in the morning to find everything laid out as hoped.

This organisation extended to the third party suppliers, of which Bredenbury have an extensive list of local recommendations. We booked the ceiling lights with Cotswold Wedding Co. and didn't have to do anything else. The band, Apollo Gold (incredible!!) set up without any hassle and didn't have any issues with Bredenbury's noise limiter. Our florist Katrina Bevis hadn't been there before, but again had no problem getting everything in place on the morning.

On-site accommodation was good for close family and friends, but there's not enough for the majority of guests and the lack of a dedicated honeymoon suite is a bit of a shame. If you want privacy for your first night as a married couple it means taking over an entire lodge. The quality and comfort of the rooms is excellent, though, and the continental breakfast served the morning after in the East Lodge was delicious, with ample options for Vegan and Gluten Free.

Jenkinsons are the exclusive caterer for Bredenbury and have an extensive menu for nibbles, the wedding breakfast and dinner. The menu and ordering process is clear, and pricing is what we expected to pay. Food and service was as slick and faff-free as everything else. A real delight.

On the day, Harriet and the catering manager were absolute superstars. Zero stress, everything ran to time and as planned, and they were always available if we had any questions or needed help.

The whole day was perfect and exactly what we wanted. I don't think we could have achieved this without the exceptional organisation of Harriet and the team. The entire process was very slick, zero stress, and we wouldn't hesitate in recommending Bredenbury Court Barns to anyone looking to get married in a countryside paradise."
V95,Bredenbury Court Barns,"I want to say a massive thank you to Bredenbury Court Barns for hosting our wedding. From the start they were super amazing and accommodating to us. They won us over with their care and support even when we had a pickle in the beginning.

Olivia was super helpful from the start and throughout the year we were planning she offered huge amount of support and suggestions.

We typed in “orangery weddings” in google when we were first looking because I was keen to get a ceremony in an orangery and Bredenbury popped up after much searching. Once we saw the Orangery we cancelled every other viewing we had across the country because we felt we found the perfect place, and nothing compared to the reception with the beautiful windows that brought all the light in. The grounds were absolutely spectacular and gorgeous. It was a no brainer for us to pick such a beautiful venue. They brought my ideas to life and we were able to get support on anything from recommendation of suppliers, to ideas on decor to their favourite meals from Jenkinson’s. They fully outdid themselves in love for us. We can’t forget it.

Our wedding day was exceptional with Lianna helping us all the way. She was a breath of fresh air. She cared about all the little details and made us feel relaxed and had a good laugh with us. The fact she was there 100% of the way, before the wedding, during the wedding, and even after is unmatched! Thank you Lianna for really being there to make our wedding day smooth and relaxing.

The food was incredible too and we often think about how sad it is that we didn’t finish our second plates, we think about it a lot.

Thank you for the wonderful journey BCB, you blew us away with your integrity, kindness, and genuine support!"
V95,Bredenbury Court Barns,thank you to everyone at bredenbury court barns who made our day so special
V95,Bredenbury Court Barns,"From the moment we stepped foot into Bredenbury Court Barns, we knew this was the venue for us. It was the first and only venue we viewed as we were blown away by how gorgeous the venue is. The venue itself is absolutely stunning, with breathtaking views and impeccably maintained grounds that set the perfect backdrop for our special day.

The staff went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. From our first consultation to the last dance, their professionalism and attention to detail were exceptional. Harriet was absolutely brilliant and I don’t know what we would have done without her!

The food was another highlight—our guests are still talking about how delicious everything was! Jenkinsons are amazing, they helped us personalise our menu perfectly!

We couldn’t have asked for a more beautiful venue to have our wedding. The day couldn’t have been more perfect! Thank you to everyone at Bredenbury Court Barns for making our wedding day nothing short of magical!"
V95,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We could not have had a more perfect experience with Bredenbury Court Barns. Right from initial booking all the way through to breakfast the following morning, everything was perfect. Nothing was too much trouble for our wonderful planner, Lianna. She ensured the day ran smoothly and our months of planning turned out exactly as we’d imagined. They are available to answer any questions you have any time, they’re only an email away and get back to you so fast. The venue itself if just gorgeous, the grounds make for some wonderful photos, and the orangery lets so much light in that your ceremony photos are gorgeous. The whole place is fully air conditioned too which was great for our July wedding. The bridal suite is a perfect balance of being aesthetically pleasing and practical for getting ready in, it’s so spacious, lots of natural light, there’s plenty of plug sockets and huge mirrors so everyone has plenty of room for getting ready and no one is on top of eachother. There’s even an outside space for getting some fresh air. I’m so glad we chose to have our wedding here, it’s given us memories to cherish forever and there are zero memories of any stress!! Cannot recommend this venue enough!"
V95,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We cannot believe how lucky we fell to get married at such a beautiful venue. Right from the offset of viewing the venue, to our special day, we were taken of. No question was too silly, and so much pressure was taken off us during the planning. We managed to make everything our own and Lianna was there every step of the way. Thank you for giving us our happily ever after. We will forever be grateful."
V95,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We loved our wedding at Bredenbury the team did an amazing job providing everything we asked for and more. We especially liked that our wedding coordinator for the day, Harriet had thought of everything for us she went above and beyond and even offered to go and get my mum some more shoes when hers broke! absolute 5-star service and the food was amazing too!"

V97,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow what can I say, Brinsop is an absolutely stunning wedding venue with heaps of character and so many options of places for the ceremony and to do things. We fell in love with it as soon as we saw it and knew it was where we wanted to get married.

Right from the start, the Brinsop team were so helpful and accommodating. From giving an virtual tour then showing us around in person, Issy and the team were fantastic right the way through. Nothing was a hassle, no request too difficult and they were incredibly professional and responsive throughout the whole process.

We loved that Brinsop is an exclusive venue with accommodation on site so we could stay with the bridal party and our immediate family. All the rooms are unique and have so much character and it's fun exploring the whole place. You feel like you are in the middle of nowhere, in nature with swans, ducks and birds all around.

Throughout our planning process, Issy and the team helped us every step of the way, being incredibly flexible in managing our requests and really trying to create our vision. They even got their team to make a giant jenga that we could use on the day! They helped to create the most perfect bespoke wedding breakfast and canapes menu, and seemed so positive and excited to be part of our special day and experience.

Arriving at the venue, Issy and the team were ready and had everything prepared and ready to go. It made the process so smooth for us and meant we could really enjoy the day without any stress. Issy coordinated perfectly with all of our vendors and it really felt like she and the whole team were so happy for us and wanted to be part of our day which was amazing. Our guests commented on how friendly and responsive all the staff were and it really made the experience extra special.

I wouldn't change anything about the day and it was perfect. I would absolutely recommend Brinsop as a wedding venue and all the staff who are really invested in helping deliver your vision. Thank you so so much to the whole team for making this a day that we will look back on for many years to come with amazing memories."
V97,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow, what a perfect day we had! It really went without a hitch and that was thanks to Nina and all the staff at Brinsop. The team worked seamlessly to ensure the day was as perfect as could be, and it really was! The wedding was booked over 2 years in advance and the staff were so accommodating with all my questions, planning and site visits, they couldn’t do more to support us. Special thanks to our coordinator Nina who was a delight to work with and a credit to Brinsop. Everyone that attended agreed at how beautiful the venue and grounds were, it was a wedding people won’t forget! 10/10 would recommend to anyone!"
V97,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"It's taken me quite a while to get round to writing this review, because sadly it's quite a bittersweet one.

We were married last year on 15 June and Brinsop was our chosen venue for both our ceremony and reception. We were first attracted to brinsop by the accomodation, meaning our loved ones could stay on-site, especially my grandparents which was so important to me.

The home itself is absolutely beautiful, including ivy cottage which myself and my mum stayed in the night before the big day. It really was a picture perfect setting, and looking down from the bridal suite seeing the ceremony space being set up on the Wordsworth lawn was honestly magical. Id dreamed of an outdoor wedding on that lawn, and we were so grateful the weather cleared so we could have it. The team really did wait till the latest they could to ask us to make a call on an inside or outside wedding (despite being June, it was a gloomy day to start) which I really appreciated!

Another amazing part of hiring brinsop was the after hours space we were able to enjoy until 2am with our house guests. The games room was absolute fantastic and meant that if you wanted to go to bed you could, but you could also stay up, party and play pool. I really do think this was a highlight for our guests and would recommend massively if you can spare some budget.

On the night of the wedding, myself and my new husband actually stayed in one glamping tents which we absolutely loved. The groundsman was on site until we were ready to leave the games room, and he then took us up to our tent in one of the buggies, making sure we had plenty of blankets and even stopping off for some bottles of water for us. This was really special, and can't thank him enough.

Hugo Spritz!! Having hugos at both our welcome drinks and drinks reception after the ceremony was amazing. I'm not a fan of prosecco myself and Mark and the team made it possible for us to have Hugo's all round. We even sneaked some up to the bridal suite to have before the ceremony (thanks Nadia!). Our guests loved them, and the amount of people that have told me they now need them at their own wedding is crazy!

Onto the not so good - sadly it all started to go a little downhill when we moved things into the knot barn for our wedding breakfast. Sitting on the top table, I could see that guests at the top of the second rows of long tables didn't really even have a seat around the table and were just kind of plonked on. The seating plan hadn't been followed, and I don't think there were even enough tables laid for the service to be comfortable for people because there was a dance floor at the end of the barn (which I did not ask for).

It was quickly also brought to my attention, that one of our guests had had to put her child on her lap in order to remove the high chair so people had more space. We also lost about 5 napkins with them setting on fire from the candles because everything was just way too cramped.

I asked to speak to catering, and asked if there was anything that they could do. I was told 'well sure, if you want the whole thing to be late'. In truth I shouldn't have even had to broach this myself, as it should have been sorted by the coordination team.

The tables weren't changed, even after they'd said they'd sort after the first course and yet the whole meal still ran late. We've had so much feedback about people not having enough food, food not being easy to access on the sharing platters etc and honestly when you've waited so long for a day and had spent 25k on the venue and food alone, it really has been heartbreaking to hear. I do sometimes question why people still bring it up (even now, people talk about the dining) when it clearly upset me so much.

Whilst writing this review my husband asked my what we had for evening food - we didn't get any. It was left unannounced on a back table. I don't know what I was expecting, just not that.

The next morning, the houseguests were asked to come down to breakfast for 9am (it was on a note in the room) but as we were in the glamping area, we walked past the knot barn just before 8.30 and the food was already out. We ran down to the house to hurry everyone up, and by which time everyone arrived it had been sitting there for 20plus mins going cold.

My biggest upset was that when I fed all of the above back to brinsop, feeling pretty deflated about the catering, I was told they'd pass my feedback on and heard absolutely nothing back. 25k total with over 10k on food and drinks to hear absolutely nothing, and this was 9 months ago. I'm not saying this in would happen to anyone else, but really - it shouldn't have happened to us either."
V97,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our wedding! From start to finish, everything at Brinsop was flawless. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most magical backdrop for our special day. Our guests were blown away by the beautiful venue, the warm atmosphere, and the seamless coordination. Every detail was taken care of, and we felt so well looked after. The team was incredible, professional, friendly, and attentive. On the day itself, they ensured everything ran smoothly, allowing us to truly enjoy every moment. A special mention goes to our amazing wedding coordinator Nina!"
V97,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We had our wedding on New Year's Eve 2024 at Brinsop, and it was more perfect that we could have ever hoped for. The venue itself is stunning, with beautiful spacious rooms which slept over 40 of our guests. Our coordinator, Nina, was incredible and so supportive on the day - she kept everything running so smoothly and everything went by without a glitch. The food and drink managers Mark and Amy did the most incredible job - nothing was ever too much, they were so attentive, and the chefs the most stunning meal after we gave them a fairly vague brief of 'curry'! We had the most perfect day and we're so incredibly grateful to Brinsop and the team."
V97,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,Brinsop Court is pure magic—an unforgettable venue with an incredible team!
V97,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We were lucky enough to have our wedding at Brinsop Court in December, and it was an absolutely spectacular day. We fell in love with Brinsop as soon we set our eyes on the beautiful manor and surrounding gardens. Cate, Amy, Mark and the rest of the wonderful staff at Brinsop really go the extra mile to make you feel special, and are extremely flexible with requests in order to make your day feel more special. We honestly felt like there was no request too big leading up to the day and they really made us feel extremely comfortable leading up to the day.
On the day, Cate and her team were well on hand to help us with setting up everything and she had everything under control when there were a few hiccups. The day itself was absolutely magical, and that wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for everyone at Brinsop working extremely hard to ensure that everything went to plan and as smoothly as it could.
Thank you to everyone at Brinsop for making us feel at ease and ensuring that our wedding was an amazing day."
V97,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Brinsop, the perfect wedding venue! We got married at Brinsop in December and I can honestly say it was everything we could have hoped for and more. We found out about the venue through Hitched and was one of only two venues that we visited but as soon as we got the house we knew it was the one. We fell in love with everything about it and it was fair to say that our guests agreed with us with many saying it was the nicest venue they’d been to. We had the wonderful Nina as our coordinator and she was brilliant! Nothing was too much trouble and we had constant communication with her in the build up which helped our stress levels no end. The same can be said for all of the staff who were brilliant throughout and allowed us to have the best day of our lives with everything running seamlessly. A special mention must be given to Amy and the catering staff who put on such an incredible menu (including the tasting session that provided some of the best food we’d ever had) and ensured that the food has been one of the main things that people have mentioned to us since the wedding! We had our ceremony in the Banqueting Hall which provided the perfect setting, especially with it being a winter wedding, as it really added to the cosy atmosphere and the lounge areas/games room were perfect for the drink’s reception. We would have loved to have also had it in the courtyard, but the temperatures meant that the lounge with the fireplace was a far more appealing option on the day. We then had the wedding breakfast and reception in the knot barn which was decorated beautifully and was the perfect place for the party in the evening. Overall we really can’t thank everyone at Brinsop enough for making our day what it was, we can honestly say that we have been made to feel part of the family and already can’t wait to hopefully come back to stay in one of the cottages for our first anniversary!"
V97,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Where do I start!!
Brinop Court is the most stunning venue, it was the first venue we visited and instantly fell in love! Theres so much history to the house and we were treated like family every time we visited before the wedding and it literally felt like home the whole weekend of the wedding, my guests also agreed!!

A special thank you to Issy our coodinator who went above and beyond ti make sure everything was perfect for us. It was so easy to plan and nothing was too much to ask, even arranging our dog to be our ring bearer!! When they say Brinsop is dog friendly they really mean it!!!

What a place, what a day!! Thank you so much everyone, you all made our day perfect and it really was the best day of our lives♥️"
V97,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We got married at the gorgeous Brinsop in October this year. It’s hard to put into words how amazing the whole experience was. We honestly had the best day of our lives!!!

We fell in love with Brinsop during our first visit back in December 2022. We knew almost immediately that Brinsop was the venue we were looking for! From the outside the venue looked like a painting - from the picturesque views of the countryside, to the swans swimming on the moat! The manor house itself has so much character, and has a lovely homely feel to it as you walk around it. Our guests were equally blown away by the venue!

A big thing for us was that it’s dog friendly, which meant we could have our two dogs join us on our special day, it wouldn’t have been the same without them there! They had so much fun walking around the grounds and greeting all of our guests!

Nina, our coordinator, and her team were always available to answer any of our questions in the run up to the day. This really put us at ease, knowing we were in safe hands. On the day, Nina and the team made sure everything ran smoothly and went above and beyond to ensure our guests were looked after. A shout out to Amy who heads up catering and Mark who manages the bar. The food and drinks were absolutely fantastic!

I highly recommend this venue! There’s a reason Brinsop is an award winning venue - and when you visit it’s not hard to see why. We are already looking forward to going back there for a date night next year! Thanks for everything Team Brinsop!

V98,The Manor at Bickley,"The Manor is the perfect venue for weddings! When our wedding venue fell through 4 months before the big day, I stumbled onto the Manor at Bickley and spoke to Craig. He was most helpful and kind and went above and beyond to make sure our wedding went ahead.

We hired the venue for our two day wedding and the staff were helpful and accommodating from start to finish. All of our guests were awed by the beautiful well kept grounds and the excellent service. We can’t thank the staff enough for making our wedding dreams a reality. They thought of every detail from bringing us champagne after our civil ceremony to making sure we had our card box at the end of the night! We are excited to head back to celebrate our anniversary there!"
V98,The Manor at Bickley,"Myself and my Husband chose this venue for our wedding last week and we can’t sing The Manor’s praises enough. From our very first enquiry, to the first viewing of the venue, right though until the big day, the staff at the manor have been nothing short of brilliant! Each staff member we came across was polite and accommodating. Special mention to Craig and Vicky with whom we did most of our liaising throughout the months leading up until our wedding. Craig and Vicky were super helpful, responsive and went above and beyond to make sure that we could have the day of our dreams. Even with last minute changes due to the weather, Craig who was just incredible throughout, managed to help us sort a backup plan so our day would still go ahead seamlessly.

The rooms at the manor were spacious and modern, giving us and our wedding party lots of space for photographers and videographers to capture the special moments on our wedding morning.

The lodge that was used for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready was fabulous. The manor was very flexible in giving us early access so we could get ready on time.

The grand marquee was definitely grand! Very spacious and when decorated looked like something out of a fairytale! lots of kitchen space, a huge bar and fantastic overhead speakers for the party!

The manor was super flexible to our needs regarding access, start times, outsourcing our vendors and much more. The venue is beautiful and spacious with options for outdoor and indoor events and entertainment. The grounds were absolutely beautiful, so many lovely spots for photos not only for us as the bride and groom but for guests too!

A very special thank you to our point of contact throughout, Craig. From our first meeting, he was charming, bubbly and made us feel super welcome. He reassured us that he has experience in African/Caribbean weddings and that our wedding day would amazing and it was. He was attentive and always let us know that he was only a phone call or e-mail away and was always quick to respond and answer any questions we had.

All in all, we had the most beautiful day at The manor and we would definitely recommend this venue for a wedding or other events.

V98,The Manor at Bickley,"We hired The Manor at Bickley for my daughters wedding. Got a brilliant service from the venue. Everything was set accordingly, as per floor plan. Our guests were loved the venue grounds/facilities and the overall wedding set up.

V99,Davenport House,We are so pleased we chose Davenport House for our wedding reception. Charley and the team were so helpful and thoughtful. Putting canapés behind the bar for us and making sure everything ran so smoothly. I am obsessed with the stunning house and grounds and it was absolutely perfect! Thank you so much for making our day so special!!
V99,Davenport House,"Davenport House is a STUNNING wedding venue so how could we not have it for our big day!?

The staff were exceptional! From the moment we booked through to our big day, we had an absolute blast and could not thank each member of staff enough! Special shout out to Jared (hopefully spelt right, haha!) who made sure we were fed, watered and ensured we took 5 minutes to ourselves every moment we could - Also even saved us slices of pie wedding cake before we went to bed!

Our guests have said they have never been to a wedding so spectacular, with the most amazing food and amazing staff so could not have been happier having Davenport as our venue! 🩷"
V99,Davenport House,"I just wanted to write to say a huge, enormous thank you to Charley and all the team at Davenport House. We still can’t believe how perfect our day was, and lots of our guests have told us it’s the best wedding they’ve ever been to. The team were all a huge part of making that happen. It was incredibly seamless and well planned on the day, meaning we genuinely didn’t have to think about a thing, except for enjoying ourselves. The day ran to schedule perfectly and even certain touches we didn’t know or expect to happen were planned by you and the team, which made the day even more special. Thank you so much for giving us our dream wedding day. We can’t wait to see the full set of pictures and the video now to relive it all!"
V99,Davenport House,"Without doubt the best day of our lives. From start to finish, Davenport has exceeded expectations. From the very first impression of the venue during the open day, the incredible food tasting evening, all the way through to the day itself, including the support and preparation leading up to it. It was really important to us to pick a venue that not only ticked the fairytale box, but also come with the complete support of a wedding planner, due to our busy jobs. We were lucky enough to have Charley as ours. She really took the time to listen and get to know us, to ensure the day was tailored to exactly what we wanted. We even had our own cocktail designed, which went down an absolute storm on the day! She considered every little detail, constantly putting our minds at ease, which made the whole process so easy and enjoyable. Honestly the day couldn’t have gone smoother, any anxiety or stress faded immediately as soon as we got to the venue. It was simply perfect. So many of our guests were complimentary of just how beautiful the venue is and just how well organised the day was, and that is the perfect way to summarise Davenport. Any prospective couples thinking of selecting Davenport as their venue, hesitate no further. It will be a day you never knew was possible! We cannot thank you enough Charley and the Davenport team, if only we could live the day over and over again"
V99,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was amazing. When looking for a venue we weren't just looking for something wow, we needed to have people who were enthused and passionate about their work - we found that at Davenport House.

From our first phone call & meeting with Lizzie and Tallulah, we knew this was the place for us. Having two brides wasn’t an issue; combining British, Asian and Spanish cultures - wasn't an issue; having brides enter together – wasn’t an issue. Nothing was an issue. At Davenport House, we got it all – a picturesque venue and the best team of staff anyone could ever wish for. All our external suppliers have commented what a fantastic venue you are. All out guests have said that the service and attention to detail was second to none. The thoughtful touches like hiring a Spanish speaking waiter for the table which spoke very little English ensured that everyone felt welcomed. Guests with dietary requirements didn't feel they got a second rate meal or they were an afterthought - the food for all throughout the day was exceptional. The rooms / cottages where our guests and we stayed, spotless and comfortable. The thought behind adding some cheese and Spanish ham to the morning breakfast - so sweet!

Special shout out to Megan - wedding planner extraordinaire who kept in touch throughout the planning process and was exceptional on the day. Ian who worked tirelessly to ensure the day ran smoothly and the food was perfect, Charley who was also in charge of one bride and ensuring that everything was on point. All the staff were fantastic - polite, professional and personal.

Everyone keeps saying that this was the best wedding they have ever attended and that’s a lot of weddings between people! When we asked why, they say things like ‘the venue’, ‘the staff’, but it all came back to the inclusivity, love & joy that they felt – and you were all a part of that.

Davenport House is a stunning venue made even better by those who work there. If you want the whole package on your wedding day, we strongly recommend you book them.

Thank you to the entire Davenport House team.

Sat and Ana xx"
V99,Davenport House,"Where to begin with our beautiful venue and thanking the people who made it all happen! We got married in November at Davenport House and it was easily the best day of our lives. We chose Davenport because we wanted to host our cosy winter wedding in a big grand house in the country, with all the grandeur and class but to still feel like an intimate celebration with our family and closest friends, and it was perfect in delivering just that. It is utterly beautiful, the location was perfect and exactly what we wanted. The food was absolutely AMAZING, we had so many compliments from our guests and we are so grateful for the team in delivering such a fabulous wedding breakfast. Thank you so much to Lizzie who couldn’t do more to help us have our dream day, and Ian who delivered the best service to us and our guests (the pizza at 2am was very much appreciated)

Massive massive thank you to Charley our wedding planner, who was so so helpful throughout our wedding planning process and on the day, I can’t thank her enough. She was always there whenever I needed her, helped me so much with creating our dream day and I will be forever grateful to her for keeping me sane! Whenever I had any worries I knew she was just a phone call away, which helped me a lot when planning a wedding!

Charley, Lizzie and Ian thank you for everything - best team ever. Our day was seamless and it was all down to you and your incredible team.

Jess and Sam xx"
V99,Davenport House,"Me and my (now) wife chose Davenport House as our wedding venue in mid 2022, to get married in September 2023, and it was the best decision we could have made. We looked at a range of Georgian style manor house type venues located in Cheshire, North Wales and the West Midlands areas. It blew all of the competition away in terms of the venue aesthetics, the balance in design (i.e. period characteristics vs modern design), the impressive condition of the property for its age plus what it offered for our wedding weekend.

Staff and service - In the UK, this is usually something that is average at best - if you're lucky. At Davenport House, the service from all staff was 10/10. I honestly don't think we've ever had better service for anything. We had a wedding planner from the start (Megan), who was an absolute saint and was fundamental in making the whole wedding a success. She was also instrumental in helping us find a way for our 'little' dog Bernie to be a part of the main event. Thanks Megan!

Accommodation - The fantastic condition, design and decor for Davenport House extends to all areas of the estate. The rooms are fantastic, very big, well maintained and cleaned religiously by the venue. We had no issues or problems from all of the guests who stayed onsite over the 3 days.

Food and drink - This got a lot of deserved praise from the guests too. We got to tailor our entire menu and it worked perfectly for what we wanted for the 3 days. The oyster bar and luxurious charcuterie board went down particularly well the day before the wedding.

I could keep writing much, much more on how fantastic this venue was for our wedding. But the best advice I could give for any interested couples is to go and visit it in person and reach out to Davenport House with any questions. Our own wedding ended up becoming both perfect and the best wedding we've ever been to. Thanks guys again!"
V99,Davenport House,"Fantastic location.
Great staff.
Beautiful place to get married.
I can wait to film here again soon thanks for having me."
V99,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was a fairytale, everything we could have dreamed of and more. Lizzie and Charley were fantastic in their support, organisation and professionalism in planning our wedding. The venue is simply spectacular- breathtaking. Our guests were blown away. The day ran so smoothly it was simply perfect. The food was out of this world our guests couldn't get enough. All the staff at the house went above and beyond to ensure we were happy and having a great day. The team were also extremely supportive of last minute changes/additions. The Davenport experience was truly wonderful and I'm sad to see it end right from our initial meetings, food tasting and finally our special day. Thank you: Lizzie, Charley, Ian and all of the team for a truly memorable day for us and our guests. Mr and Mrs Kissane"
V99,Davenport House,"We got married at Davenport House in February and they provided us with the most perfect day. Lizzie, Charley, Ian and the rest of the team were the best hosts we could have hoped for. Nothing was too much to ask and the guests all commented on the hospitality shown to them. The setting is utterly gorgeous, our weather was less than favourable so we did not make the most of the grounds but this didn't matter, the house was setting enough and so atmospheric! The food was utterly AMAZING and better than most restaurant food I have eaten. The venue feels intimate and grand at the same time.
I literally cannot recommend this place enough, they gave us the wedding we had always wanted and more!"

V101,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge on 12 May 2023 and it was incredible. The views are gorgeous and the photo opportunities are endless with beautiful floral and green surroundings. The team were super responsive throughout the process which is really reassuring and helpful when planning a wedding, and Nelson who ran the day was just fantastic. Every single detail was thought of and they run a really slick operation. This is essential as it meant I had a lot less to think about! They put me and my partner at ease throughout. The food and service on the day was fantastic, so many of our guests said this was the best food they’ve ever had at a wedding. Highly recommend! (Photos by Costa Weddings UK)"
V101,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","Pembroke where super helpful and provided a lot of guidance in helpful forms and layouts. Always available for a call and very helpful. on the day, it ran super smooth and and staff where lovely. Thank yo for making it a great day!"
V101,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge in October 2024. The whole day was magical, including the beautiful view over the autumn trees in Richmond Park. Robert made sure everything ran perfectly and helped us to find slots in the busy wedding timetable to fit in some special moments to also reflect traditions from my husband's Dutch culture. The food was great and the staff were polite and fun. All preparation with Lucy was also smooth and done with a smile. The Pembroke Lodge team ooze experience but make every wedding feel special and really listen to your wishes for the day. Highly recommend! Thank you to the whole Pembroke Lodge team, especially Robert, Lucy, the kitchen team and the staff on the day!"
V101,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park",The staff has been very helpful. They have a lot of experience. Open to any suggestions and help in critical situations.
V101,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue than Pembroke Lodge for our summer wedding. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most gorgeous backdrop for our special day. A huge thank you to our banqueting manager, Nelson, who went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly.

The team was incredibly supportive and accommodating throughout the planning process, making it an enjoyable and stress-free experience. Their professionalism and attention to detail made all the difference, and we’re so grateful for everything they did to make our day unforgettable. Highly recommend!"
V101,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We got married on the 3rd of October this year, and the team made our day magical! What a smooth day. We loved every second of it! The guests loved everything, and raved about the food and organisation.
Hiring Pembroke Lodge was easy. We had a viewing where all information was shared in detail and super clear to understand and make a decision.
On the months leading up to the big day our contact was Alice. Alice is a star. Responsive, professional, and had answers and solutions to everything.
On the day, Nelson coordinated the whole thing, minute by minute, and we are forever grateful for his politeness, professionalism and high spirits. We felt safe and in good hands. I would give Pembroke Lodge way over 5 stars if I could :)"
V101,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","My wedding went without a hitch, thanks to the amazing team at Pembroke Lodge (special thanks to Nicola & Robert)! They made sure everything was set up perfectly on the day, exactly in the way we had requested, and then ensured the day itself went as smoothly as we could've hoped. Everything looked beautiful and the stunning views made all of our guests fall in love with the venue too."
V101,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had the most perfect day. The team have all been so responsive and accommodating of our every request. The venue is beautiful and we were lucky to have gorgeous sunset views. It is truly a countryside wedding but conveniently close to London, which was important for our overseas guests. The food was fantastic and staff were professional and efficient. Would recommend to anyone."
V101,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We recently had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge, and I cannot say enough good things about the venue, the team and manager, Robert. From the moment we started planning to the big day itself, he was absolutely incredible.

Robert went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. He was always available to answer our questions, offer solutions, and provide creative suggestions that enhanced our vision. He coordinated effortlessly with our vendors, making sure everyone was on the same page, which took so much stress off our shoulders.

On the day of the wedding, he was a true rockstar! He made sure the timeline flowed perfectly, from setting up the ceremony space to ensuring the reception transitions were seamless. His dedication and hands-on approach allowed us to enjoy every moment without worrying about a single thing.

Our wedding was a dream come true, and we owe so much of that to him and the team! Thank you, for everything you all did to make our day magical."
V101,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We could not have wished for a better wedding venue for our special day! Everyone went above and beyond to make sure our day goes perfectly without us having to worry about a single thing! A big shoutout to Nelson who was absolutely brilliant and made the day feel so calm and well thought through.

The food was delicious and all the team was so welcoming and super helpful on the day.

Thank you so much, we really really appreciate all the help!"
V102,The Hackney,"If you are having a wedding for under 60 people then this is your place! From start to finish the communication and planning of the wedding was seamless and took so much of the stress out of the day. The totally customisable packages that they offer really does suit anyone’s budget and more importantly regardless of what package you end up going for it is value for money. The food was delicious and it catered to everyone’s tastes including a pregnant guest, halal, vegan and lactose intolerant and was the talking point for our guests. The venue itself is stunning! Lots of exposed brick, they had recently redecorated before our wedding and the reception room that doubled up as the dance floor was styled simply but made a statement and the outdoor covered patio area was a welcome addition. The team understood our vision from the get go and they completely nailed it, all of our guests couldn’t believe it was here! I honestly can’t recommend it enough if you’re wanting a small and intimate wedding venue but still with all the class. I would say to future couples even if you think this wouldn’t be your venue please please do have a proper look because it will change your mind, I had come across this venue multiple times over the course of a year and decided to take a leap of faith and give it a chance and we’re so happy we did."
V102,The Hackney,"We can’t recommend the Hackney highly enough. They made the whole process so easy and they offer so much in-house which we took advantage of. The food was especially great - our guests were amazed “best food I’ve ever had at a wedding” and the team took great care of us during the planning stages.

They offer a very customisable service with scalable pricing. If you’re having a fairly small wedding (under 60) then you must check out The Hackney.

We had such a perfect day and we owe so much of that to the fabulous venue. Beautiful space, so professionally run."
V102,The Hackney,"We had such a brilliant experience working with the team at The Hackney. We were regularly in touch throughout the planning process and the use of the shared spreadsheet was especially handy for keeping everyone informed.
We had to postpone our wedding two days before as we were both sick with COVID, and the team were just fantastic. They waited for us to recover and then we started to talk through options again. We were able to rebook just six months after our original date, and the team were accomodating and understanding throughout the process.
The day itself was perfect. Lots of our guests commented on the quality and quantity of the food and Hugo was great at keeping everything to time. We wish we could do it all again."
V102,The Hackney,"We had our wedding reception here and wow was it amazing. Hugo, Erika and the whole team were amazing. Every single guest commented on how delicious and plentiful the food was. The staff were amazing nothing was too much to ask and all so happy.
The venue itself was decorated amazingly, given we left our wedding stationary etc up to the venue it exceeded our expectations. I was concerned about the allowed decibel level for Dj / entertainment but it was plenty loud enough. I wish I could relive the day again, if you’re thinking about booking The Hackney do it! You will not regret!"
V102,The Hackney,"We held our wedding reception at The Hackney in July and it was truly the best experience. We opted for a standing reception for our 65 guests, serving food bowl-style for a more relaxed, less formal feel. The food was absolutely delicious and there was lots of it - it just kept coming! Our guests are still raving about how good the food was months later! Lots of good drinks options too - we especially like the cocktails here!

The staff on the night were so friendly, welcoming and were amazing with our children guests too!

The Hackney is such an aesthetic venue with exposed brick walls and existing foliage which we loved, so we kept additional decorations to a minimum. We dropped our decorations to The Hackney the day before and picked them up the day after, which was super easy! We hadn’t given them too much direction with where we wanted everything placed but when we turned up to the venue on the day it was truly perfect! The staff know exactly what they’re doing and had decorated it beautifully! The outdoor seating area is a great feature too (especially for our two greyhounds who chilled out there for the majority of the reception!)

We opted for a simple Spotify playlist for our music and their sound system was good.

The wedding planning process was super easy from start to finish, with continued support and check-ins from Hugo, from the moment we booked, to the day itself! We really enjoyed the menu tasting experience earlier in the year too, which is a great touch in the build up to the big day! The planning spreadsheet was easy to use and made us feel content and relaxed, knowing that everything was under control.

Overall, we would highly recommend The Hackney to anyone looking for an affordable, dog-friendly, wedding reception venue with a laidback vibe, delicious food and lovely friendly staff! We look forward to coming back every year to celebrate our anniversary, with an espresso martini!"
V102,The Hackney,"We hosted our wedding reception with the team at the hackney in May 2023. The planning experience was straight forward and easy to book. The availability for the venue is on the website so easy to see when they have and get it booked. We went with the 5 canapés, bowl food menu, and drinks on arrival with wine through the event. The staff were brilliant and food delicious.

We loved the vibe of the venue as we wanted a bit more of a casual event, with a relaxed feel and we were able to host our 85 guests with no issues (although limited to standing event at this size, there is enough scattered seating for anyone to sit when they wanted).

In terms of decorating, we didn't feel the need to add any extra flowers as the venue was already so made up with plants and other decorations.

We did add the photo box which I highly recommend, was great fun for our friends and family and came with a memory book. People were shy at first but really got into it. We also used the recommended baker who provided a delicious cake.

Final area to mention - pricing. Wedding venues can be really expensive and daunting before you even start paying for any food or drink. Something that really attracted us to this venue was the low spacing cost and the minimum spend with it. It meant that we were able to completely customise the experience and see where the money we were spending was going. There are many different options and packages to go with, so it's up to you.

Only thing that wasn't offered was any tasting of the food beforehand which we would've liked to have done but none the less, the food was delicious so it wasn't really needed!

To finish, we loved every moment of it and hope that many others get to experience the same. Thank you very much team at the hackney!"
V102,The Hackney,"We had our reception in July. The venue was cosy and comfortably fit 30 people without feeling too crowded or too empty (we were worried it might be too empty). We managed to fit a band in, arranged mini-golf in the venue after dinner, and customize the cocktail menu with custom recipe (that we provided before hand).

One of the biggest highlights was the food. The crispy roast pork got so many complements and indeed it was tasty. But really, all the dishes were amazing (we had a tasting session prior), it was hard to choose, but the taste of each dish was still top notch on the day itself too. I heard that the supper snacks we ordered were great too but alas, I was too busy and they were snapped up instantly!

Some other details:
* We were allowed to use the small room downstairs as a private space to put our stuff. Very handy to not mess up items.
* We went with a bar tab and kept increasing the budget each time till the end of the night instead of the all-you-can-drink. From our rough calculations, it worked out about the same going for all-you-can-drink. Of course, certain folk were heavy weights and more than made it up will be different for each crowd.
* Lighting for photos came out excellent (combination of photographer and venue lighting).
* You can adjust air conditioning to suit the weather (we had ours on the warm side due to older folk not dealing with cold too well).
* Outdoor space was a pleasant change in atmosphere for those who wanted some fresh air.

What about the review from the Bride? Bride approved this review."
V102,The Hackney,"The day was fabulous - Hugo was brilliant and flexible with what we were after. The tasting day before was such a great idea and the whole experience and guidance given made planning a wedding in c.5 months so much easier. We had vegans, last minute drop outs, ridiculously hot weather, about 3 different spotify playlists, a string quartet, florists arriving in the morning and a cake that arrived the day before - the team took it all in their stride and it seemed like a breeze. Loved it all and we've had such good feedback from guests. A fabulous whirlwind.

Two very minor points for feedback - we maxed out the guest numbers (the team did advise us against it but were very accommodating despite us also throwing musicians into the mix) and it was a little too crowded pre-lunch on such a hot day. We also put some speeches in between courses (again, we were recommended against it) and that may have been a slight mistake for the dessert timings, as the tasting day was 10/10. But, it was a perfect day in a stunning venue. Loved it - thank you guys."
V102,The Hackney,"Jon and the team were absolute superstars, hosting the perfect wedding day for us. The space is beautiful, the decor is modern and perfect. They were so accommodating for any request or question we had which we really appreciated. Guests commented on how great the cocktails were! The day ran so smoothly and we had a fantastic time."
V102,The Hackney,"From the initial phonecall to the warm welcome we got when we first visited The Hackney, we knew we were in safe hands and that we’d made the perfect choice. The venue offers the most beautiful interiors - the perfect mix of cosy, intimate and modern industrial - exactly what we were looking for!

Our entire experience with The Hackney was an absolute dream -we loved the mega organised approach to planning. Something that could have been incredibly intimidating was made so straightforward with the amazing support of Hugo the General Manager who embraced all our weird and wonderful suggestions and gave expert advice on what we could do to make things even better. We left every meeting buzzing with ideas and even more excited to welcome our closest friends and family to the big day.

The quality of the food and drinks is impeccable - every single one of our guests (even the fussiest!) has commented on how much they loved it. We absolutely loved the menu tasting, even though it made the decision even harder as everything was amazing. What makes it even better for us is living close by and being able to pop into our wedding venue for a coffee or a cocktail!

I couldn't recommend The Hackney enough - I just wish we could go back and do it all again!"
V103,PYRÁ,"We held our wedding reception at Pyra. We booked the entire venue, with the upstairs loft serving as a dance floor with bar and downstairs having tables and seating for guests.  Canapes were served upstairs and a buffet dinner was served downstairs.  We lucked out with great April weather, so guests were also able to enjoy Pyra’s patio and additional space on Lonsdale Road. We were very happy with our decision to have our reception at Pyra, and many of our guests commented on how lovely the space was, how nice the staff were, and how delicious the food was.
 
The venue:
The space is gorgeous with lots of natural light upstairs.  Guests arrived at 4pm but we had the venue for the entire day, and Pyra gave our florist access earlier to set up beautiful flower arrangements and candles - it looked stunning.  Pyra set up our welcome sign and card box too. The venue also accepted delivery of our cake on the morning of the wedding which was a huge help, set it up very nicely upstairs, and cut it for us after the formal “cake cutting” shots.  We were able to coordinate with Pyra ahead of time to arrange the space how we wanted, such as how many tables we wanted downstairs and the set-up of the loft upstairs.  They even had a microphone ready for us upstairs so we could say a few words to our guests before our cake cutting. Perfect! For the evening dancing, we were able to set the disco lighting to our colour scheme, which worked really well with candles and foliage (latter 2 provided by our florist).
 
The food:
The buffet dinner was fantastic.  Pyra gave us multiple menu items to choose from and we were able to fix a nice menu that took into account guests’ dietary restrictions.  We initially booked the venue when it had a different chef and menu.  We came in a few months before our wedding to try the new menu – our dinner was delicious then and there was no dip in quality for the buffet-style served at our reception. Fionn worked with us how to plan best - because we wanted a relaxed style with a dance floor upstairs, we ended up feeding our 80 guests in two sittings downstairs, which worked perfectly. The upstairs space can seat 60 people, which didn’t work for how we planned our event, but does look really nice in photos. The late night food served around 10pm also went down very well.
 
The staff:
The staff, including the bartenders and waiters, were hardworking, friendly and very nice to guests.  Enough staff were around that guests never had to wait long for drinks.  Members of staff cut our cake for us and also boxed up the late night food for guests to bring home.  Fionn, the day-of coordinator, was on-site for our entire reception and was very helpful, even helping coordinate our midnight bus arrival.
 
Responsiveness:
Overall we were happy with the responsiveness of the venue.  It took a little while to nail down the final details of the food menu and drinks menu/bar tab but we were ultimately very happy with the result.  As the venue hosts more weddings/ larger-scale events we’d expect this will improve.

Overall:
We highly recommend Pyra for a wedding reception. We had 80 guests in total, which worked very well for the canapes/cocktail hour upstairs (4-6pm), sit-down buffet downstairs (6-8pm, split into two seatings) and dancing upstairs (8pm-midnight).  The upstairs loft was able to fit all 80 guests plus a four-piece band.  Lonsdale Road is also a charming street that provided great photo opportunities.  We looked into several other venues, and came away happy with Pyra's quote – we were able to book the venue, food (including canapes, dinner and late night food) and a generous bar tab for roughly the amount some other London venues were charging for just their space (no food or drink included). We and our guests had a fantastic time. Thanks so much to Fionn and the Pyra team :)"
V103,PYRÁ,"We had our wedding celebration at Lula. We booked the loft and restaurant for this.

Positives:
The venue is beautiful and needs minimal decoration.
The food was amazing; the chef is truly professional and everyone loved it.
They redecorated the restaurant section and added a set of couches to make it a lounge, which was beautiful.
The staff was very hardworking, professional, and lovely.

They provided us with a lounge, a wedding breakfast space and a dance floor.

Flexibility with Cake:
The bakery was scheduled to deliver and set up the cake at 16:45, but they delivered it at 09:45 instead. The Lula team handled the situation professionally by storing the cake and setting it up at the correct time. They presented the cake beautifully and assisted in cutting it into nice pieces. It could not have been more perfect.


The list of available drinks was huge, and they were happy to make custom drinks and bring in different juices if requested in advance. The event manager tried to accommodate every wish we had, and on the day we could not have hoped for more. Most of our guests said it was one of the best weddings and most beautiful venues they had ever been to.

Negatives:
Food tasting for the wedding menu was not included, which we had assumed would be, but it was given at a 50% discount. We had to sort out the floral decoration last minute, as they had initially suggested they would arrange it for us after providing a budget, but later said we needed to find our own. At times, they were a bit slow to respond, which made us anxious, but after communicating with them, this was resolved, and communication was very swift.

In conclusion:
Lula gave us the most beautiful wedding we could have dreamt of. We highly recommend them. The venue, the food, the service were amazing, and we could not have hoped for more."
V104,Sandon Manor,"We had such a special wedding at Sandon Manor, the team made every effort to make our day so so special and we will be forever grateful for that. A dream team! The day ran so smoothly and they worked so hard. The venue is unique with lots of different spaces which unfold throughout the day, which was perfect as our wedding fell on a wet and windy autumnal day. We would highly recommend Sandon Manor!"
V104,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor provided the perfect venue for our wedding. From the initial conversations and meetings with the team, we knew we were in safe hands and had made the right choice. They kept us informed with any events, made information a bit payments clear and reassured us with any query we had.
The accommodation was exceptional and fitted our requirements perfectly, with high quality finishing touches throughout to ensure our stay was as comfortable as possible.
The wedding venue was incredible! Our ceremony took place in the gorgeously modern barn with stunning draping and greenery. Following on, we had a blissful drinks reception which was on the expertly manicured lawn (with mini golf!) and sun-trap of a courtyard. We then moved onto our wedding breakfast which was held in the main barn, seating all of our guests comfortably with space for decor and extra details. Following from dinner, the part started and the club room came to life! This was absolutely the talking point of the day and our guests raved about how incredible it was! It managed to create a club-like atmosphere, whilst maintaining the vibe, albeit at a reduced volume, in the rest of the barn. The layout of the venue was important to us, as it ensured our guests never strayed too far, to keep the momentum of the day.
The team at Sandon worked superbly with all of vendors which ensured the day ran smoothly from set up to clearing. All of our vendors commented on how much they too loved working there.
The venue, the aesthetics, the staff, everything was perfect! We would absolutely recommend to anyone getting married."
V104,Sandon Manor,"We cannot recommend Sandon Manor enough. From the quality of the service, the helpfulness and friendliness of the team, the beautiful accommodation and the most amazing venue which all or guests loved partying the night away in. To make it even more special the Manor is in amazing grounds in beautiful countryside and nature reserves.
Sandon Manor made our dream come true."
V104,Sandon Manor,"I couldn't recommend Sandon Manor highly enough - from our first enquiry to our Wedding, nothing was too much trouble. The team are so friendly and easy to communicate with, very approachable and responsive. They respond to any questions immediately and having the day before to set up with Tom was fantastic. Styaying in the Manor House and Dovecote was the icing on the cake as to be with friends and family the night before and the day after was so fabulous. On the day Tom and the team were absolutely fantastic and couldn't have done more to make our special day. We couldn't have dreamt of anywhere more perfect than Sandon Manor - a huge thank you to all the staff."
V104,Sandon Manor,"If you are considering Sandon Manor for your wedding venue, I beg you: scratch it off your list now. Yes, the house and grounds are beautiful, but the people behind it are absolutely awful. They ruined our wedding experience.

I will get straight to it. Sandon Manor has a very strict policy on guests leaving the site by 11:30pm (and no one is allowed back to the Manor unless they’re official guests staying overnight). We had lots of international guests at our wedding. Many hadn’t seen each other in years and would be jetlagged - we thought they may be keen to continue chatting after 11:30pm. With this in mind, we made a booking with Sandon Village Hall via our contacts at the church (where we were attending services and later married). They granted us access to the village hall until 1am as a contingency spill over space.

We mentioned this in passing during our online meeting with one of the Sandon Manor team a month before our wedding. Within hours, I received a voicemail from the lady in charge of Village Hall bookings saying (quote) “someone at Sandon Manor is trying to throw a spanner into the works for you”. It soon transpired that they had raised an official complaint to the parish council and pressurised the village hall team into cancelling our booking. To be clear, Sandon village Hall and Sandon Manor are entirely separate entities – there is no crossover between them whatsoever, as the owner of Sandon Manor later acknowledged.

It gets worse. Gob smacked, we asked Kate – the owner of Sandon Manor – for a call to find out what was going on. She was abhorrent, trying to justify her meddling as a necessary measure to protect her wedding license (side note: with Sandon Manor it is always about the money – once your deposit is paid they care nothing for your ‘special day’; you are just another cash cow). Did she apologise for stabbing us, her clients, in the back? No, she did not. She could not even fathom how hurt we were by being completely bypassed in the communication chain and how deceitful and disrespectful this was. My husband and I were quite literally left speechless. We’ve never experienced this sort of treatment from anyone, let alone our wedding venue - to whom we were paying many thousands of pounds. Dealing with this stress in the final month of wedding prep really took its toll on us and soured things. We no longer looked forward to our day, rather dreaded what Sandon Manor might do next.

Aside from this major incident, there were many other occasions when Sandon Manor were unhelpful and unfeeling in their interactions with us:

- We enquired if it would be possible to arrange a large pizza takeaway order instead of using Sandon Manor’s caterer for our late night food. One of the team explained on a call that this wasn’t contractually possible; we acknowledged this. We then received an email saying ‘If you are unable to follow this or any other of our T&C's we would be happy to cancel your booking.’ This was less than a month before our wedding.
- We had a harpist perform in the church. We were told she wasn’t allowed to play during our drinks reception in the grounds due to potential noise complaints (an acoustic harp at 2pm in the afternoon). No other music was permitted outside the house.
- Sandon Manor is an incredibly expensive (in hindsight, grossly overpriced) venue. But we were also hit with hidden fees when booking their accommodation option - an extra £425 ‘cleaning fee’ was added to our bill.
- At the time of booking, Sandon was running a promotion waivering the £700 fee for hiring their ceremony space. As we were marrying at the church, we asked if it would please be possible to put this towards other elements of our day i.e. using their festoon string of lights in the barn (for which they charge £450). They refused.
- We were unsure about booking the 1-bed Dovecote on the grounds as - at £499 for the weekend - it was a considerable expense. While we were deciding Sandon Manor rented it out on Air BnB (to one of our guests, which made for a very awkward conversation).

To summarise, you only get one wedding day. Kate and her team absolutely ruined ours. There are so many other lovely venues in north Hertfordshire run by decent, humane people. Please prioritise your happiness and choose wisely. I wish we had."
V104,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor is a stunning wedding venue with a great team behind it. The exclusive use of the manor for the weekend was a highlight, allowing us to relax with friends and family in the lead up to and after the big day. The Sandon team were brilliant, guiding us through the planning process and ensuring everything ran smoothly on the day. We couldn't have asked for a better place and team to help us celebrate our big day."
V104,Sandon Manor,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our special day. Holly, Tom and the rest of the brilliant team made us feel welcome from day one. Special mention to Tom for making the day run so seamlessly, so professional and accommodating of all our needs.

The venue itself is stunning, located in the beautiful Hertfordshire countryside. The Manor House makes for a tremendous location to prepare, and the Dovecote suite is a nice touch: a great addition for the groom to spend the last night. We loved the small details of the characteristic main venue, with the botanical feel to the bar a great backdrop to the barn.

It’s a shame we can’t stay every week!

Dan & Suzanne"
V104,Sandon Manor,"To Holly, Louise, Tom & Kate, wow, what can we say but the biggest thank you for the best day of our lives! When we viewed the beautiful venue over two years ago we just knew instantly Sandon Manor was the one, not just because it’s stunning, but you guys are amazing! Thank you for making all our wedding dreams come true. Forever grateful and can’t wait to return to reminisce. Lots of love, the new Mr & Mrs Jakes xxx"
V104,Sandon Manor,"From the moment we visited Sandon Manor we knew this would be our wedding venue for 9 September 2023. Seeing the spectacular finish of the house carry through to the completed venue just shows the high level of attention to detail this venue had to offer.

Holly, Tom and the rest of the team filled us with confidence right from our first interactions, annd went above and beyond on the wedding weekend itself to facilitate us, our suppliers and guests. The main house, dovecote, annex and extensive grounds were a wonderful way to have close family stay with us on site, and so handy to be able to all get ready nearby the morning of.

Thank you for making our wedding weekend a truly memorable occasion, for us and our families. We all look back on this day with the happiest, sunniest memories and Sandon Manor will always have a very special place in our hearts."
V104,Sandon Manor,"We had the most amazing wedding weekend at Sandon Manor.

The venue itself is the perfect backdrop for a wedding, our photos looked amazing from every single angle. There were so many spaces to make use of throughout the day which helped things to run incredibly smoothly and meant we didn’t need to have a ‘turnaround’ during the evening. The spaces really wowed our guests and created such a lovely atmosphere. Including the ‘club room’ dance floor that had our guests dancing until the very last song!

We stayed at the Manor House for the weekend, extending our wedding into a perfect weekend retreat. The house itself is beautiful, with lots of different areas for everyone to relax, and the perfect peaceful location to chill the night before the big day!

From our first viewing to checking out the day after our wedding, the Sandon staff were attentive, friendly and helped us feel relaxed and looked after throughout an otherwise overwhelming process. We’d highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for a beautiful, peaceful and unique wedding venue!"
V105,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Thank you so much to the entire team for making our wedding so special! Thanks to Donique, MJ, Mo, Harry and everyone else for helping us organise our day and for their professional but friendly attitude. Merchant Taylors is such a beautiful venue and offers a brilliant layout and different spaces to make the day so special!"
V105,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you all so very much for such an amazing wedding on Saturday. You all worked tirelessly to make it so special. Everything was truly wonderful and you all did me proud! Both Hugh and I couldn’t have asked for anything more in terms of being so well looked after. Our guests were so impressed and have given us so many compliments on a brilliantly well run event. Thank you all again for playing a brilliant part in our truly wonderful day of which we loved every minute
V105,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you so much for the most wonderful wedding reception at the end of April. We had the perfect day and our guests all commented on how well looked after they has been. Thank you again for all your hard work!
V105,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"We know this is very late (we have no excuse), but we wanted to say thank you for everything you and the team at Merchant Taylor's did for us on our wedding day. All the guests have since told us how much they loved the venue, food and service. Fingers crossed you get a few couples getting in touch! Again, Thank You for everything!"
V105,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"My brother and I attended the wedding today, as Florist's for the wedding party.
We were treated fantastically well by ALL the staff that we met, nothing was too much trouble and they made our task a COMPLETE pleasure.
If this is how they treat the actual wedding party then you will have a unforgettable time. Many thanks to all the staff for helping us to do our job with ease ."
V105,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Zara,

Can we thank you and your team at Merchant Taylor’s Hall for all your hard work in making Caroline and Neil’s recent wedding so very special. You, in particular, were able to deal with every question and request in a really professional manner.

Merchant Taylors’ Hall is part of the rich panoply of history and tradition, which makes this great City. All of our guests, and in particular those from abroad, were totally spell bound by the atmosphere, the food and service.

James was superb in organising the whole operation. To turn the Great Hall from a wedding ceremony hall to a banqueting suite for 110 guests, including flowers, place settings and dance floor in ninety minutes was truly remarkable.

The food and wine was of an amazing standard, we know that Merchant Taylors’ Hall has a reputation for presenting some of the finest dining in the City of London. You certainly surpassed all expectations.

We have many wonderful memories of the 10th September 2016, but it is best summed up by our daughter Caroline, “Can we do it all over again?”."
V106,Garden Museum,I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate everything that you did to make our party such a success last Friday. It was brilliant being outside on such a lovely everning. Everyone was very impressed with the venue.
V106,Garden Museum,"Thank you for all your help, advice and on-the-day support, it really made our wedding very special and it certianly went off without a hitch! The Museum looked amazing and the garden was perfect, especially as the sunshine adn the guests wanted to make the most of the beautiful surroundings."
V107,Clearwell Castle,"Can’t tell you how wonderful the team were at Clearwell. Our wedding coordinator Phaedra was exceptional. Attention to detail and everyone of the team from front of house, waiting staff, groundsmen and the DJ made our day absolutely everything we dreamed of and unique to us.

Can’t recommend highly enough and cost was outstanding value for money.

So many our guest commented on the quality of the food and that it was the best wedding they had been too! The children loved the magic of the castle and opportunity to get outside and see the grounds.

The grooms family had a fabulous time staying in the cottages the night before and our guests at both the Castle & the Wyndham had a fabulous stay on the night of the wedding.

Wish we could do it all again!"
V107,Clearwell Castle,We had our wedding at Clearwell in June and we couldn’t recommend it highly enough. From start to finish everything was perfect and they went above and beyond to ensure we had an amazing day. I’d not hesitate in recommending them to any couples. Just a gorgeous place with staff that really care in making your day all that you hope it will be.
V107,Clearwell Castle,"From the moment we first visited Clearwell, we knew this was the venue for us. From the moment we started planning to the final touches on the day, all the staff were fantastic. Ann, our wedding coordinator, was a delight to work with throughout. Nothing was too much trouble and she kept us updated throughout. The day was tailored exactly to our needs and when we arrived at the venue on the day they had prepared everything perfectly.

We did the night before package which included rooms and food the evening before. We were supplied with so much food no one went hungry. The rooms in the Wyndham and the Castle are fantastically appointed.

The venue itself is gorgeous. The cellar bar downstairs adds a whole different dimension to the occasion where you can really let your hair down.

This was an absolute dream come true venue for us. We loved every single minute."
V107,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot fault this venue at all. We initially had to change our wedding date because of lockdown and they were so supportive and empathetic.
Ann, our coordinator, is quite possibly the loveliest person on the planet. She was always happy to answer any questions and it never felt like we were being a nuisances or asking a silly question.
On the morning of the wedding she was a lovely calm presence and the whole day just ran like clockwork.
The food was out of this world with many guests saying it was the best food they’d had at a wedding and one person actually thought we’d hired a Michellin Chef!
The venue is so so beautiful with plenty of space. The downstairs cellar was a great place to party the night away, it was like an exclusive nightclub. There were lots of quieter rooms for people who wanted some peace.
The DJ was brilliant, we forgot to give a list of songs we liked but he did a great job of guessing what we liked ( he must’ve looked at our age and figured nineties dance music was our era. And he was bang on the money)
I do not have a single complaint about this venue"
V107,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot speak highly enough about Clearwell Castle as a wedding venue. The venue itself is absolutely stunning. It rained on our wedding day but the indoor space was so vast and beautiful that ourselves and our guests still had the most amazing time! Our wedding co-ordinator, Phaedra, was absolutely incredible, both before and during the wedding. She was always so professional, replied to all of my emails (there were many) and answered all queries efficiently. On the day, we genuinely could not have managed without her. The day flowed so well with her guidance and it really helped me as the Bride as I felt I didn't need to worry about anything! All the other staff at Clearwell and at the Wyndham hotel were also so wonderful! Everyone worked so hard and every member of staff was so kind to us; it just made our day incredibly special and we are so appreciative to them all. The food was great, service very quick and all the guests really enjoyed it! We had so many compliments about the staff and venue! I honestly could not recommend Clearwell castle more as a wedding venue!"
V107,Clearwell Castle,"Our wedding on 10/11/23 was just the absolute perfect day from start to finish. Our wedding planner manager, Hannah, was incredible, not just on the day but throughout the whole planning process. She ensured everything ran smoothly on the day, sparing no details ensuring everything was just perfect and to time but without being stressful. She was very accommodating with the planning meetings working around both mine and my now Husband's shift patterns.
We both stayed the night before our wedding and the night of the wedding with many of our guests travelling a distance so also staying in the Wyndham which was very convenient. Staying in Keepers cottage with the Bridesmaids the night before added to the experience with the added feature of the hot tub, the groomsmen were very jealous. The beds were very comfortable and everyone was excited to stay in a castle.
On the day of the wedding, the staff were very accommodating moving the bridal party along to the bridal suite to finish preparations earlier than originally planned. The breakfast provided was the perfect amount for a busy morning getting ready. Everything, including the gardens, were immaculately kept adding to the WOW factor of getting married in a Castle.
The canapes served and welcome drinks were well received by the guests and ourselves whilst we had photographers prior to the wedding breakfast. The food was phenomenal and great portions and I was stuffed after. The staff were very accommodating for us with a lot of people with allergies, dislikes of mushrooms so adapting the menu for these individual people. We were even able to swap out a few bottles of wine included in our package for cocktails as us as the Bride and Groom did not drink wine.
As soon as we walked in the venue the first time, we knew it was the place we wanted to get married. Everytime we went back to view the venue again I fell more and more in love. For anyone thinking about viewing or even booking this incredible venue I would say do it! We will be going back for events in the future to relive the best day of our lives."
V107,Clearwell Castle,"We got married at Clearwell castle April 2023. What can I say it's the most perfect venue and we had the most amazing day. The organisation was amazing and the staff were great on the day and even leading up to the big day. Phaedra was our wedding planner and communication with her was great throughout and on our wedding day she ensured that it all ran smoothly. I cannot recommend Clearwell castle and their staff enough. Thank you again for helping us have our dream wedding.
Kind regards

Vanessa & David x"
V107,Clearwell Castle,"We had the most amazing wedding day on the 24th of November 2023, the whole day ran so smoothly and all our guests absolutely loved the venue. The food was amazing and our guests loved the fish and chip buffet in the evening! The whole progress of planning the wedding was so straight forward and Phedera was a great wedding manager."
V107,Clearwell Castle,"Clearwell Castle exceeded all our expectations for our wedding day. The moment we stepped onto the grounds, we were captivated by its timeless charm. The staff, especially Hannah, went above and beyond to make every detail perfect, ensuring a seamless and stress-free experience. The Ball Room, where we exchanged our vows, felt like something out of a storybook. The surrounding gardens provided a stunning backdrop for photos and added to the overall enchantment of the day. Our guests were equally impressed, and many commented on the unique and romantic atmosphere. Choosing Clearwell Castle was the best decision we made for our special day; it truly felt like a fairy-tale come to life."
V107,Clearwell Castle,"We had the perfect wedding at Clearwell Castle, their team were superb in providing planning assistance from the point of our booking, guidance on all aspects of our wedding choices from registrars and suppliers, and coordination on the day of the wedding to make sure it flowed seamlessly. It was a beautiful day, and we couldn't be happier with our choice of Wedding location."
V108,Inner Temple,We got married here in 2023. Everything was perfect and the team made sure the day/food etc was just as we wanted it. Particular thanks to Priya and Eva (Pegasus) for their hard work making our wedding day and lead up so special.
V109,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"I got married at Dodford Manor in February this year. A great time was had by all and I will be recommending the venue to any friends planning weddings.

The weather was bad on the day so we didn’t get to use the outside area very much, but it didn’t matter as the inside is so lovely.

Sky was really helpful and put me at ease on the day. Questions in the lead up and on the day were answered quickly and I was made to feel like the only bride in the world!"
V109,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford was the first venue we looked at shortly after we got engaged. The staff were friendly and relaxed when we had a tour, I knew it was the place for us! I think Lydia telling my now husband that we couldn’t have fireworks due to the animals nearby but we could have a fire performer outside, sold the deal for us! I got an amazing fire performer as a surprise for my husband and the guests after we had sparklers, and it just completed an amazing day!
We heard such positive things Dodford about how professional and smooth running weddings have been from our suppliers, and you guys didn’t disappoint. You handled the day so well, we didn’t worry about a thing and just enjoyed ourselves the whole day.
We honestly had so many lovely messages and conversations after our wedding about how the venue was amazing, everything and everyone was catered for, from my 88 year old Nan, to young children who could play and enjoy the outdoors with a scoop of amazing ice cream. We honestly couldn’t have asked for a better day, we would do it again in a heartbeat if we could! Thank you for making the day so seamless! We are eternally grateful to everyone at Dodford for making our dreams come true becoming Mr and Mrs Price!"
V109,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford Manor what an incredible venue, from initial enquiry to booking, Dodford and the staff were so accommodating and well organised. Nothing was ever too much trouble, even if emails were being sent at 11pm. The day itself, wow it was absolutely incredible, as our wedding was on a budget and due to small numbers Dodford were amazing at setting out our decorations, everything was absolutely perfect and a special shout out to Kayleigh who was amazing on our wedding day. She kept us on time, always checking we were okay and just such a lovely person and really made our day perfect. Would highly recommend a Dodford to any couple due to be married they make the planning and the day an absolute dream and we want to relive it over again."
V109,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"It goes without saying that Dodford is a fab venue.... stunning set up, well maintained, clean, perfect grounds etc... but the best thing about Dodford is the team! I had super high expectations of any wedding venue I booked as I used to run a wedding venue myself (potential nightmare client 😂).... from the 1st viewing the team were fantastic. Relaxed, stress free, organised, professional, knowledgeable, flexible but mostly importantly friendly which gave me complete confidence in them delivering my perfect day.
In the run up to the big day the team are super responsive on email and phone We didn't meet our Event Manager, Lydia, until the day but I was always confident that they work as a whole team and therefore having 1 point of contact was not necessary at all.
In the day Lydia was amazing! Still relaxed and professional and the whole day ran so smoothly. Every requirement was perfect, on time, delivered exceptionally.
We had the best day, thank you to the whole team (especially Lydia!)
Vic & Tony

V109,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We honestly can’t say thank you enough for how amazing Dodford Manor Barn was, along with all the incredible staff who helped make our day truly unforgettable.

From the moment we visited, we fell in love with the beautiful landscapes, open-plan barns, and stunning large windows that flooded the space with natural light. The venue package was one of the best we saw during our search—it felt like everything we could possibly need was covered.

The team at Dodford Manor Barn were incredibly friendly and supportive throughout the entire planning process. Communication was open and consistent, which made everything feel so much more manageable and stress-free. We were even able to find all of our wonderful vendors through Dodford Manor Barn, which was a huge bonus!

As a bride who suffers from anxiety, I was unwell on the morning of the wedding. But I have to give special thanks to Kayleigh and our vendors, who were absolutely amazing and supported me through every step—they helped me feel calm, cared for, and ready to enjoy the day.

Our guests couldn’t stop talking about how stunning the venue was and how lovely the food turned out. We were also lucky enough to have sunshine all day, topped off with a beautiful sunset in the evening—it truly felt magical.

Thank you again, Dodford Manor Barn, for being such a perfect place to start our next chapter.

With love,
Carter & Emmie (24.03.2025) x"
V109,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"From the moment we booked our wedding at Dodford Manor, we knew we were in good hands—but nothing could have prepared us for just how extraordinary the experience would be. Every single detail was handled with such precision, care, and genuine warmth that it truly felt like a dream come to life.

The venue itself is breathtaking, but what made our day unforgettable was the impeccable service. The entire team operated like a well-oiled machine, making sure everything ran smoothly while keeping the atmosphere joyful and stress-free. Their attention to detail was second to none—no request was too big or too small.

We want to give a heartfelt, special shoutout to *Lydia*, our incredible Wedding Manager. From our first meeting to the final dance, she was nothing short of amazing. Lydia went above and beyond at every turn—anticipating needs before we even voiced them, coordinating flawlessly with suppliers, and offering support with a calming confidence that put us completely at ease, (apart from making me cry the second I saw her! 😂). Her passion for what she does shone through in every interaction, and our day would not have been the same without her.

Thanks to this amazing venue and its phenomenal team (especially Lydia!), we were able to truly enjoy every moment of our wedding, knowing everything was in the best possible hands. If you're considering this venue for your big day—don’t hesitate. It’s everything you hope for, and more.

We want to do it over and over!
A day we will NEVER forget!!

Thank you again and all our Love,
Mr & Mr Pargeter-Prince
Rowan & Karl xx"
V109,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We booked Dodford Manor in Feb 2024 after we viewed the space, for our wedding in March 2025. It was the only venue we viewed, but instantly fell in love with the character and variety of spaces the venue had to offer. The free corkage also really appealed to us as a great way for us to bring our own drinks at a good cost.

From start to end, the team were amazing, helping us with the planning of the day and making sure we had a great array of suppliers we could work with. The live band was a huge part of our day, and Dodford have a great mixture of acts on their supplier list.

On the day of the wedding, the groomsmen arrived at the venue to help with set up to see that our amazing event manager, Kayleigh had every single aspect of the day in hand and sorted. She sorted all table settings, decor, stationary - Everything!! Nothing was too much to ask of her and the Dodford team. The day ran impeccably well, with everything being on time and everything we asked for being sorted. Our drinks were served chilled, on time and were always around. It’s easy for venues who offer free corkage to try and limit you drinking your own drink - Not here!! There was constantly beers being topped up, wine bottles replaced and aperol spritz being taken round. Cannot fault them!

The team packed all of our bits away and ready for us to collect the next morning. We are very aware Dodford is a busy venue and wanted to make sure we wasn’t just “another wedding” but at no point was that the case. We felt like we were the one and only wedding and genuinely could not ask for more!

Thank you so so much for everything, Highly recommended!!"
V109,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We got married her a month ago today and had the most amazing day with them. Jess, Jack and the team made sure that everything ran smoothly and that they were doing everything they could for us on the day. We would 100% recommend them for anyone wishing to marry in such a beautiful setting."
V109,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We had been apprehensive booking Dodford for our reception that it was so popular in Northamptonshire that our wedding could end up looking the same as a lot of others we knew of, as we're local - but that was a ridiculous thing to worry about! The level of flexibility/customisation you get with Dodford is unmatched in our opinion; as it's such a beautiful venue to start with, you don't have to work hard to make it look good before adding in your personality as a couple!

The whole process from enquiries to final planning and the execution on the day were great. We did have a slight issue with them not inviting us to a food tasting in enough time before our wedding date (whether they forgot/we were missed off a list we don't know) but when we did raise it they invited us to a tasting at their sister venue instead (it's 2 hours away but we were available to travel thankfully). Every member of staff we encountered in our experience with Dodford were so friendly and make you feel like you are the only couple that matters for them in that moment, which we really appreciated from such a popular/busy venue. Abbie was our Event Manager on the day and provided such an elevated level of service, nothing was too much trouble and she executed our plans/vision to a tee, adding in some extra details that we loved too.

Our wedding was in December 2024, and we only had our reception at Dodford, so the ceremony barn was set up for our drinks reception with plenty of space for guests without it feeling cramped or equally like we were all rattling around in there (we had 75 guests for our reception). They don't have many photos of indoor drinks receptions in their promo so I was a little worried how it would look but the team had it set up beautifully. We also had a brass band on the mezzanine level which was really fun and festive!

What sold Dodford for us was the no daytime corkage, which meant we could really personalise our drinks reception and wedding breakfast drinks without breaking the bank. There was a slight disconnect with how and when we had requested/planned to serve some of the drinks in our planning meeting and what happened on the day, which we think may have been a slight hiccup in communication between Dodford and Jenkinsons (the caterers), but it didn't have a negative impact on our day at all!

Overall, there's a reason this is such a popular venue - it is truly perfect!"
V109,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,Dodford manor is an amazing wedding venue. From the very beginning when we first stepped into the venue to look around we fell in love. We knew we had to have our wedding there. After booking the venue we had amazing contact with the staff from booking our food tasting session. To a general email to see how our wedding planning was going. The planning meeting was well organised and we were able to talk through exactly what we wanted and no want was too big for the team.
V110,Gosfield Hall,"I never imagined my wedding would be somewhere as stunning as Gosfield hall but from the minute we saw this venue we knew it was the one for us and didn't bother viewing anymore venues as we had already made our minds up about having our wedding here! We were absolutely blown away with the natural beauty of Gosfield hall and so booked two years in advance of our wedding day! The professionalism and advice we received from Linda was super helpful and informative on the run up to our wedding as there is soo much to think about! We loved that we could have our day and evening all in one place aswell as the option weather permitting to have our wedding ceremony outside. I'm pleased to say the weather was absolutely perfect on our wedding day and we got to have our fairytale wedding outside! The package we paid for was well worth the money! Our guests were absolutely spoilt on our day and have all said it was the best wedding they've ever been too! It was amazing to have our guests stay over aswell! Jocie our wedding planner was absolutely amazing! She was sooo friendly and super accommodating and went above and beyond on our day to make it absolutely perfect with no hiccups! She even helped dress me on the day as she knew how to do up a corset dress and my mother didn't have a clue lol she made all my wedding details and decorations come to life and done such a stunning job decorating our dream venue aswell as being super supportive towards me my family and guests! The honeymoon suite is the best we've ever seen and completely took ours and our guests breaths away! Mind blowing! The food,venue,grounds,accomodation and night before accomodation were absolutely stunning and we want to thank everyone at Gosfield hall for making our day soo incredible and special and a day we and our guests will never forget! We can't wait to return to Gosfield! Thank you everyone at Gosfield what an amazing place!"
V110,Gosfield Hall,"We had previously experienced Gosfield Hall as a guest before deciding on it for our anniversary.

Our day was beautiful and went according to plan. Our guests all had great feedback about the day.

The only thing we would have changed would have been more diverse menu for the main meals."
V110,Gosfield Hall,"Gosfield hall is a beautiful location for a wedding and their packages cover all the important stuff! We didn’t have to worry about caterers, wedding coordinator or a DJ - all included! Great service, lovely food and everyone really enjoyed the day! Our coordinator Jocie was fab on the day, getting everything organised and fetching anything we needed. Couldn’t have asked for better, she knew the time line and the day flowed really smoothly!"
V110,Gosfield Hall,"We got married at Gosfield Hall and everything about it was perfect from when we arrive to view it, booking, the communication and Faye Carter our wedding Coordinator! If you want the best wedding day with no hassle, Gosfield is your place!!"
V110,Gosfield Hall,"Myself and my Wife have just got married at Gosfield Hall,
Our expensive started when we viewed the venue and we first met Linda sales manager, she welcome us in & made us feel at home, we wasn’t sure how, but she made us feel calm like this was where we was meant to be.
Once we looked around at all the venue has to offer we had already made a decision as this is such a stunning location and instantly new this was what we wanted! It was just right for us.

We did not get made to feel pressured to make any decisions immediately however we did end up booking our big say within the next few days after our visit.

Our next contact was with Ellie our wedding planner, she was very helpful and nothing was ever to much, we enjoyed the food tasting at the venue and was very impressed with the experience, it was out of this world.
Ellie helped us through all of our problems and made sure all of our plans come to life.

Now on our big day, what can I say? The staff were amazing, Ellie couldn’t have done enough every time you wanted to ask a question she was next to us any time we needed something. She was there all the way through the day/ night & even the next morning, Ellie made our day Run seamlessly.
We’ve been to many weddings before but never have we had food as amazing as we did here.
Every guest was amazed at the food quality and commented on how delicious it was!
Just to sum up if you’re thinking about booking your wedding at Gosfield Hall don’t question it just book it. You will be amazed."
V110,Gosfield Hall,"The venue is stunning and was the perfect setting for our winter wedding (so much natural light even in January). Jocie Golbourn was our assigned wedding planning specialist and she is so kind, sweet, patient and professional. All our guests loved the venue but many actually commented on how flawless and seamless the day was organised and rooms decorated and prepared from each section of the wedding and we only have Jocie and venue staff to thank for their meticulous planning and preparations. The food and drinks were delicious. Couldn’t recommend this venue enough- we actually booked the venue on a whim and were SO happy when we visited for an open day. There’s no false advertisements- it’s stunning."
V110,Gosfield Hall,"Everything, from start to finish, was exactly what we wanted and more. The preparation was helped by our wonderful personal manager, Tara, and accommodated each and every one of our requests and needs. The venue is gorgeous, food delicious, and atmosphere felt special. Our friends and family all told us that this was such a spectacular wedding for them that it was the best they've ever been to. We felt completely taken care of, kept us calm and happy throughout the day, and kept all of our suppliers in place and to standard. It felt glamourous and unique. We wish we could relive the day over and over. It really was our dream wedding."
V110,Gosfield Hall,"We got married in Gosfield Hall in May and had the most amazing wedding day that any couple could ask for. The whole experience from the arrival the night before to leaving the day after was seamlessly managed by the team at the venue.
The house and the grounds looked absolutely stunning and Ellie and the team did a brilliant job at keeping the day running smoothly without making anyone feel rushed. Everyone there was immensely friendly and helpful and we really felt that everyone who worked there was invested in making our day feel special.
We fell in love with the venue when we booked it but the whole experience exceeded out expectations so much that we wish we could do it all again!"
V110,Gosfield Hall,"I wanted to take a moment to commend and state our appreciation for Jocie. She truly was phenomenal, approachable and no task was too big.
We had 5 months to plan our wedding and we loved every moment. With us both working in the service industry it was great to have someone who was so switched on and would be an asset to have on any team."
V110,Gosfield Hall,"Having just got married at Gosfield Hall I can honestly say it was the most beautiful venue and the most perfect day. The staff were so attentive and professional. The food was outstanding and the drinks and cocktails were fabulous. They couldn’t do enough to make sure our day was everything we’d dreamt of. I have to say a special thanks to Ellie - one of the wedding coordinators on site - she went above and beyond to help us plan our day and was there from the very moment I woke up delivering fresh pastries for breakfast to the moment she made me a cup of tea to go to bed with. I can’t thank you enough Ellie, you are an absolute credit to Gosfield Hall."
V111,Kingston Estate Totnes,"When I first enquired with Kingston I thought it would be too expensive but we explained what are budget was and when we wanted to get married and they put a quote together that was affordable.
We have just had the most amazing one day wedding which didn't finish until the early hours. We got married in the Long Barn where there are chandeliers running down the middle, it was very romantic. There is this nightclub at Kingston which is very cool which everyone loved. The guests all said the venue was stunning and the food was out of this world.
A few of us stayed the night before and most of our guests stayed the night of the wedding in the cottages and barns. The staff were brilliant and they coordinated the whole day for us. I cant recommend the venue enough."
V111,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had a two day wedding at the Kingston Estate. All our guests were completely blown away by it.
Most of our friends and family had traveled far for the weekend and were not disappointed when then arrived as the cottages and barns are gorgeous. Some even have hot tubs.
Jodie and the Weddings Team organised a welcome party for the first night which was unreal along with providing street style food for everyone around 8.30 pm. At Kingston they have this really cool enormous Yurt and food hut which is used the day before the wedding and for breakfast.
On the wedding day itself we got married in the Walled Garden and there were endless canapes during the drinks reception. We then decided to eat in the Hayloft Barn which has glass windows overlooking all the gardens.
We used the clear span marquee for our reception party and had the craziest cover band before we all went into the nightclub until 3 am. The good thing about Kingston is everything is included they let you use things like cake stands, easels, knifes, speakers, microphones, all furniture at no extra cost, they set everything up for you and then clean up afterwards. We didn]t have to do anything which made everything totally stress free.

Thank you Jodie, Ellie and Charlotte it was insane !!"
V111,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had the most magical wedding at Kingston. From the moment we set foot onto the grounds, we knew it was the perfect place for our special day. It was our first viewing… and nothing else compared for us (we saw a total of 6 venues). What stood out to us the most was the variety of spaces available for each part of the day. The selection of ceremony areas, the beautiful outdoor spots for photos, the yurt for the night before party, and a special one for us… the underground nightclub for the evening! As party lovers, this was a part that sold it for us; there was somewhere for every moment.

One of the things we loved most was the flexibility to personalize every aspect of our wedding. The venue truly felt like a blank canvas that we could transform into our dream setting, but equally, we got away with doing absolutely nothing as it was beautiful all on its own.

But what truly made our experience unforgettable was the incredible staff, led by Jodie. They were not only professional and attentive but also genuinely warm and welcoming. Their support and attention to detail ensured that everything ran smoothly, allowing us to relax and fully enjoy our day.

We're hoping to return and stay in the future, for a special occasion.

It's not just a wedding venue; it's a place that holds a special spot in our hearts as the backdrop to the beginning of our happily ever after 🤍"
V111,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Kingston was perfect. Despite a rainy start, the day was amazing and Jodie was available but subtly in the background allowing the day to be ours."
V111,Kingston Estate Totnes,"After over a two and a half year wait due to Covid, our son and his wife had a wonderful wedding weekend. Jodie from Kingston Estate and her team of staff went above and beyond to ensure the wedding ran smoothly. Every detail was dealt with professionally. The accommodation, venue and food were all excellent and all our guests many from overseas had a wonderful time. The only thing Jodie could not oversee was the weather but even a little rain didn't spoil the celebrations."
V111,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue and staff were brilliant from start to finish. The venue is really multi-functional and caters for rain or shine. The weather was really unpredictable around the time of our wedding but I was a stress free bride knowing they had it in hand. The food supplier was stunning - we had a weekend package which all the guests raved about. That coupled with the unlimited drinks pages made it the perfect venue for us. A Devon treasure that feels like being on a film set - everyone loved it!
V111,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Such a beautiful venue - we loved it so much. The food was incredible and despite having a changeover of wedding planner close to the wedding day, it had no impact on our day what so ever. The venue are calm and professional and loved their approach to communication which was friendly."
V111,Kingston Estate Totnes,Fell in love with the venue on our first visit. We were particularly looking for a venue which could cater us for 3 days and sleep the majority of the the guests. The grounds were well kept especially the walled garden which is where the ceremony took place. The team were a pleasure and made the day truly special.
V111,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Our 3-day wedding celebrations were spent at the STUNNING Kingston Estate - a truly unique venue that we absolutely fell in love with. It had EVERYTHING we were looking for & more. The grounds are perfectly manicured all year round & come complete with walled garden. The cottages & main house are beautifully decorated, providing luxurious accommodation for 86 of our guests. Sarah & the team were such a pleasure to work with & couldn’t do enough for us. The catering was also top notch. Thank you"
V111,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue was great we had a few personal health issues beforehand but the team went above and beyond to make the day extra special. The wedding planner organised everything for us and they had plenty of props on site that we were free to use. We had the whole place to ourselves for the weekend it was brilliant and our friends loved the hot tub and pool.
V112,Holmewood Hall,"We were married at Holmewood Hall on 15th February 2025 and I can honestly say that it was the most magical day. We went to visit the venue and instantly fell in love with it but even we were blown away by how beautiful everything looked on the day. All of the staff were amazing - special shoutout to our personal wedding manager, Laura Pike, who was always on hand to answer any questions - she couldn’t do enough for us! The food was wonderful & we had full control over the menu. Would highly recommend this venue, you won’t regret it!"
V112,Holmewood Hall,"Holmewood Hall was an absolutely perfect wedding venue. The house is stunning, well cared for and beautifully decorated. All of the staff are so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Our Wedding Coordinator was fantastic, available from early morning of the wedding and was still there the morning after working for us. The food was excellent, drinks and canapes were amazing and the venue took care of everything for us. We had the most perfect wedding and are so pleased we chose Holmewood Hall. The Gold Room where we had our ceremony is gorgeous. Thank you for giving us a beautiful wedding!"
V112,Holmewood Hall,"I cannot fault this venue at all, the venue itself is breathtakingly beautiful with magnificent rooms and very lovingly maintained grounds. The staff are incredibly friendly, professional and efficient, our wedding coordinator Lee was a pleasure to work with and made our special day run smoothly. If you want a hassle free wedding with breathtaking grounds and the most amazing staff then this is the venue for you."
V112,Holmewood Hall,"Had the most amazing wedding here recently and cannot recommend it enough.

The venue itself is stunning and the options included in the luxe package covered everything we could've possibly wanted and made planning the wedding 100x less stressful.

The staff were all amazing from start to finish, Katie showed us around initially and then Lee was our personal wedding manager, and they were both incredible throughout. Always on hand to answer any questions and help us through the day once we got there.
We had so many comments from our guests on how lovely the staff were on the day!

A particular highlight though was the food - the tasting evening was a dream and the chef went above and beyond to provide a full vegan menu for us which wasn't limited to only a couple of options.
Again, we had so many non-vegan guests complimenting the food and saying how lovely it was!

Overall, an incredible day and an incredible venue.
Thank you so much to everyone there!"
V112,Holmewood Hall,"This place is simply just amazing 🤩
We had our wedding here on 17-12-24 and it was everything we dreamed of and more. The food, staff, decor were just perfect not forgetting the most beautiful Christmas tree 😍
Our person wedding planner Lee was an absolute god send not just having him there on the day but always being at the end of a phone to answer any questions or worry’s.
If we could go back and do it all again we would and not change a single thing.
The most perfect day at the most perfect venue ♥️"
V112,Holmewood Hall,Perfect venue for a wedding with guest numbers 60 - 100. Our guests and I moved from each room to a new room throughout the day and every room had a new surprise. The bridal suite was lush and it was great having all our guests staying under one roof. I would 100% recommend this to anyone.
V112,Holmewood Hall,"The wedding day and lead up to the day were fab. However, for the price we paid, we expected a little bit more.
I opted to use the bridal cottage the evening before for which we paid £450 extra. This is something I now regret, as there was no hot water and we were not able to order any food in as all the take away options were shut (on a Friday night). The hot tub also needed a good clean. So the night before/morning of my wedding was not ideal. I flagged this to the manager who advised that we should have raised the cold water issue as soon as possible, but seeing as we were trying to have morning showers on the wedding day, this did not leave us any time.
Our package included pre-drinks, wine with dinner and we also purchased a cocktail ""cart"" (cocktails on a table) and a bucket of beers. The groom, who is not a wine fan, asked for a beer with his wedding meal and was presented with a contactless card machine to pay for it at the top table. We felt this was a bit unnecessary as there was a full bucket of extra beers outside and it felt a little embarrassing having a card machine presented to us at the top table on our wedding day for one measly Corona, despite the huge amount we had paid. Also, guests were unknowingly allowed to buy beers from the bar after the meal, despite there being available beers to them already in a bucket next to the bar...
Overall the wedding was lovely, but for the price we paid we expected a bit better. Essentially, I loved the venue, but I wish we had not purchased any extras!"
V112,Holmewood Hall,"We got married at Holmewood Hall on 4th October 2024. From the first moment we stepped into the venue and I saw the magnificent Gold room I knew this would be the perfect place for us to get married. We had the most amazing day which was perfectly coordinated by the whole team at Holmewood but especially so by our personal wedding manager Lee. Lee was always quick to respond to any questions we had in the lead up to the day and nothing was too much trouble for him.
We honestly wish we could do it all over again as it was a magical day. We would recommend Holmewood Hall to anyone looking for the perfect venue."
V112,Holmewood Hall,"After getting engaged in late March this year we wanted to get married fairly quickly so booked Holmewood for the same September. The venue, grounds, accomodation were all stunning and we felt very fortunate it was within budget and the package we got was outstanding in comparison to other venues and what it included, which was far far more than other venues. We got to attend a luxe event to choose all our wedding food, canapés, cocktails and wines which should have made things easier but due to the unbelievable quality it made it harder! Our wedding planner Lee is literally the most fantastic person. He was flexible, fun, engaged and on absolutely everything. The day was ran impeccably and also smooth even with some weather concerns and speeches taking a bit longe than we thought. If you book here ask for Lee!! We had the most perfect day. Can’t fault a single things. Our guests all told us how incredible everything was with one even saying he will now longer not attend any further weddings unless it’s at Holmewood. Thank you to all the staff and as mentioned a huge special thank you to Lee! Your a legend!"
V112,Holmewood Hall,"Exceptional venue, stunning grounds, fantastic DJ, and excellent service. Highly recommended! Happiest day of my life 😊"
V113,Bourton Hall,"We got married at Bourton Hall on 08 March 2025 and our wedding planner was Harminder. The day was absolutely amazing from start to finish. All the food and drinks were of a high standard and presented beautifully which includes the wedding breakfast, canapés and cocktails, and breakfast the next day. The venue is gorgeous with lots of rooms, well maintained grounds and exclusive use. The staff are friendly and accommodating and the event was really well managed. We would like to particularly thank Harminder, who was supportive throughout the wedding planning process and the wedding day, ensuring things ran smoothly and in a timely manner. He is a great communicator, provided advice and guidance where needed and attention to detail. We really had a magical day! Thank you so much! We would happily do it all over again and would definitely recommend this venue!"
V113,Bourton Hall,"What a fabulous wedding venue! Because it's a wedding venue and not a hotel that holds the occasional wedding, they really focused on what was important and anticipated our every need. It's an elegant venue but with a comfortable feel to it. The team are incredibly accommodating and helpful and each couple is allocated their own personal wedding manager to guide them through the process and to make sure every detail is covered.
There's a beautiful chapel on site where non-religious ceremonies can be held - this was fabulous.
The food was plentiful and delicious - all our guests raved about it. Great choice of welcome drinks and canapes, wines and cocktails.
The grounds are gorgeous; a perfect backdrop for our October wedding.
The venue was exclusively ours and has beautiful bedrooms, including a huge, stunning bridal suite. Most of our guests stayed overnight and took advantage of the brilliant breakfast in the morning so it really extended the celebration."
V113,Bourton Hall,"Our wedding at Bourton Hall was better than we ever imagined. The Italianate mansion is truly spectacular inside and out however it is the team that made our day run perfectly. Our guests found the setting and the food incredible, they were very impressed! Our wedding planner Emily Sarjant was fantastic her knowledge and expertise made our day magical from start to finish, with all the special touches that she suggested. Our first dance was created in such a beautiful way it will be a memory we cherish forever. Thank you to Emily and the team at Bourton Hall. My husband would also like to note that the croquembouche was amazing and everyone should have one."
V113,Bourton Hall,"My wife and I got married at Bourton Hall in September, with our wedding managed by the wonderful Eleni. Everything about the day went as perfectly as we could've wished, right from arrival to departure the following day. The venue is stunning, and the food was lovely, and having 21 bedrooms on site was such a bonus so that all of our close friends and family could stay on site with us.
Bourton Hall did everything they could both in the run up to the day and on the day itself to alleviate all stress to ensure everything ran as seamlessly as possible, which it absolutely did.
We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall enough."
V113,Bourton Hall,"We were married on 28th July 2024. What an amazing day we had at Bourton Hall. Could not fault it! The venue is so elegant! The grounds and views were to die for. The food was out of this world with so many choices and all cooked and served to perfection. Accommodation / rooms were plentiful and luxurious. Lovely to have a chapel on site too. We had the whole place to ourselves, we felt like royalty! Lots of varied rooms and areas for people to choose where they wanted to be after the wedding breakfast. We would choose the venue all over again!"
V113,Bourton Hall,"We had both our wedding ceremony and reception at Bourton Hall and the service was superb throughout. The house and grounds are beautiful with amazing views to go with them. The staff were professional and helpful during the lead up to our wedding day and during the day as well - even when we had an emergency prior to the ceremony which caused delays, the venue staff were able to work around this to move timings back in order to allow all of our planned activities to go ahead and be fully enjoyed. All the food was delicious and we had a wonderful wedding day thanks to Bourton Hall."
V113,Bourton Hall,"We had the most perfect wedding day at Bourton Hall. Throughout the planning process and on the day, the team were so professional, which meant we could relax and know that everything was in their capable hands - Emily was an amazing wedding manager. The building is beautiful inside and out, and the grounds are stunning - there are so many places for beautiful photos, and views out over the countryside. The food was absolutely delicious, it was so hard to choose what to have! It was also so helpful to have so many places for guests to sit and chat in the evening, away from the disco room but still part of the action. Having so many bedrooms onsite (not to mention a stunning bridal suite!) was an added bonus. We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall highly enough, and have had so many comments from guests saying what a beautiful, elegant but relaxed day it was, so I know they really appreciated everything Bourton has to offer too. Thank you so much to Emily and the whole team for giving us such a perfect day!"
V113,Bourton Hall,"As the Bride and Groom we were made to feel like nothing was too much to ask and they couldn't do enough to make us feel special.
All the guests commented that it was one of the prettiest and most relaxed weddings they have been to.
We could not have asked for a better wedding day thanks to Bourton!"
V113,Bourton Hall,"I had my wedding on 10/02/2024 I am so happy I chose this venue, It is really magical. My wedding manager was just the best! Emily went above and beyond to help me on my big day! I cannot thank her enough.

One of the main things about this venue is that t has its own chappel which is really special and makes you wedding seem more traditional, however there are more options/ rooms available. I wanted the wow factor and I got it.

Some of the options that made it great

*Onsite accommodation for night before and night of the wedding is really helpful
*Exclusive use
*Dedicated wedding manager definate gamechanger! (Emily)
*Menu choices are fantastic.

Everyone commented on the food being really nice ( we had the lamb) The evening buffet was also great. I paid extra to have a meal created as having part of my culture within the food at the wedding was very important to me, they did not disappoint.
Emily was perfect in so many ways, she knew exactly my vision once i explained it to her and she made sure that it became real for me. She adapted parts of the day so that it would work better, for example bringing the canapes outside whilst photos where being taken. Helping me into my dress, looking after my phone just everything I needed she was there. She really worked hard to make sure it run perfectly and it did.

Thank you emily!!! You made my day Great."
V113,Bourton Hall,We got married at Bourton Hall on 30th July 2023. It was the most amazing day ever! We are still receiving compliments from our guests on how stunning the venue was and the whole running of the day. This was 100% down to our wedding co-ordinator Harminder. He went above and beyond to ensure our day was absolutely perfect. He literally could not have done any more! Thank you again Harminder!!
V114,B&H Buildings,Bourne & Hollingsworth was such an exceptional venue for our wedding this September. This is the perfect place for you if you want a true London wedding that feels like a fun dinner/house party but on an epic scale. We used the top floor (the studios) for our sit down dinner (think candle light and tasty roast lamb) and headed downstairs for our reception with the basement club (below and hidden) for late night dancing. The place is stunning (greenery and glass everywhere and the cocktails are insane but what really makes this place are the people. The whole staff from Matt and Lizzie to the bar team to the dinner crew made our whole day seamless and so fun. Could not recommend B&H more highly for your London wedding.
V114,B&H Buildings,"Beautiful wedding celebration in the most stylish venue - we had an intimate wedding reception (drinks, dinner and more drinks!) at the Bourne & Hollingsworth Buildings. The staff members on duty were excellent - nothing was too much trouble and they served everyone with such professionalism. We couldn’t recommend it highly enough and we haven’t stopped talking about it since. All of our guests were so impressed with the space and how stylish it was. The bar, restaurant and greenhouse are all aesthetically beautiful and the botanical vibes make for a very relaxed, but premium setting. Special shout out to Lizzie who helped us coordinate everything and Matt on the day who led the team. Thank you so much - we had the best day and we couldn’t have wished to host it in a better venue."
V114,B&H Buildings,"India & the B&H team were seamless. Flexible, responsive, kind, and easy to deal with. They made our day so special. The food was fantastic, the drinks were lovely, and the value for money was first rate!"
V115,Leez Priory,"I never in my life thought I would get married in a place like Leez priory! The whole experience from start to finish was just fantastic. The price breakdown was manageable and there was no pressure to take any upgrades offered. The things we got in our package were phenomenal and having a wedding planner was tremendous - our lady (Leanne) was an absolute god send!
They catered to all our needs and we were made to feel so comfortable and nothing was a problem! I’d highly suggest going to an event there before hand, just to get a feel of what it’s like full of people and enjoy their delicious food. We actually enjoyed their entertainer ( singer) so much we hired him for our wedding ☺️
Lee priory is just so beautiful. I can’t speak highly enough x"
V115,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory on the 7th of September 2024. Considering how long they have been a wedding venue, they were pretty flexible with some of the ideas we had for the venue styling that turned out amazingly!

The staff really made the day something special and couldn't have done enough for us. Special mention must be made for Leanne, our wedding planner, who was amazing!

Highly recommend the venue and the incredible team that helped to make our day so special!"
V115,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in October 2024. This venue is stunning both inside and out with immaculately kept grounds and interior. The hospitality in the lead up to and on the day of the wedding was fantastic. The food was also brilliant. Another great perk of this venue is the amount of on site accommodation.

A couple of drawbacks / experiences during our wedding. There are only a few toilets in the main building which kept blocking and overflowing throughout the evening which led to us taking some guests to the dressing room or honeymoon cottage to use the facilities. You are also restricted by the venue on any external food or drink suppliers and the venues optional extras for this are quite expensive for what they are.

That asaide, we had the best day and evening at Leez Priory and would certainly recommend it!"
V115,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in August 2024- great venue and experience from initial viewing to leaving the morning after the wedding. Leanne acted as our wedding planner and was friendly, professional and helpful throughout. We opted for the classic package and the food was amazing quality with everyone commenting how full they were!
The venue is beautiful with several options for ceremony both inside and out. Accommodation was great too. The whole day ran smoothly with perfect weather - we will have very happy memories of our day!"
V115,Leez Priory,"Perfect venue and very attentive staff, lovely food and great communication from start to finish"
V115,Leez Priory,"Stunning venue. Fantastic Team. Very accommodating toward our unique ""surprise"" strategy. Our guests were truly surprised. Thank you."
V115,Leez Priory,"Leez priory was the 1st and only venue we looked around when we started planning our wedding. From the moment we stepped on the premises, everything just looked so perfect and exactly what we wanted from a wedding venue. When we got assigned our wedding co-ordinator Rachel, she was just absolutely spot on with everything we asked for and nothing was too big an ask for her. She made sure the day ran as smoothly as possible and took care of any issue that arose without me knowing (which I am forever grateful for!!)
The rest of the staff were amazing and very helpful.

The venue itself is just absolutely stunning and we loved that it has the pub area as well as the dance floor so it catered to all of our guests.

All of the rooms were lovely and it was so nice being able to stay in the fisherman’s lodge onsite the night before the wedding.

We genuinely cannot recommend this venue enough and it was 100% worth the money! 10/10!"
V115,Leez Priory,"We got married on a Tuesday in October to maximise the value of what we could get for our money; and honestly, we got everything we wanted and more. Leanne, our Wedding Manager was perfect at bringing an attention to detail and seamless organisation to the big day, and in the lead up. There wasn't one moment of the day where we felt stressed, as Leanne had it covered. In one particular instance, our flowers for the bridal party's hair hadn't arrived. Within five minutes of telling Leanne that we needed this, the flowers were with our hair and make-up suppliers to add the finishing touches.

Leez Priory as a venue is the most stunning setting, and offers an incredible range of areas in which the ceremony and reception can take place. There is also the opportunity for the bridal party to make use of the Fisherman's Cottage the night before the wedding, and for people to stay in the on-site accommodation on the evening of the wedding, making it the perfect venue for people also travelling from further afield.

Leez Priory were very accommodating, welcoming and were happy to work with us to make our day as perfect as possible. The food was incredible, and a total hit with all of our guests, and so many people have commented on how incredible the day was as a whole. You wouldn't be disappointed to choose Leez Priory."
V115,Leez Priory,They catered to our every need. To when we would ask for things they hadn’t been done before they still made sure it went smoothly. Leanne was amazing she made me feel so comfortable from the start. The whole day was stunning. Beautiful venue please go view it as you will not be disappointed
V115,Leez Priory,We got married on the 26 May 2024. This venue was absolutely brilliant! They catered for every need and made sure there was no stress on the day. Leanne was kind and level headed throughout and was always one step ahead! Do not hesitate to book- do it now!
V116,London Rowing Club,"We picked this place because we wanted somewhere fairly central and casual. We fell in love with the long room and the view. Our wedding was in October so we thought we'd have it cosy but we ended up with a beautiful autumnal day so everyone was on the balcony. The fairy lights were perfect and the other rooms were great to avoid leaving. The staff was so friendly and accommodating that we would definitely recommend the venue.

The only thing that could have tainted the day is that after three visits and many emails, we were never told that the river floods (a lot). We were flexible with our day so if we knew this we would have built it into our day, instead, I was told by the photographer on the day as I got out of the taxi that we wouldn't be able to take any group photos because the area would be flooded during the cocktail hour and half that we had assigned as photo time. This would have been disappointing but we all ended up running outside after the ceremony to take photos before the tide came in. My husband and I borrowed wellies for our couple photos. We had fun doing this, but I can imagine many couples being upset! My friend's electric car also flooded and they were obviously upset."
V116,London Rowing Club,"Annabel was meticulous in her help planning the wedding. Very knowledgeable and helpful.
On the day the rest of the staff were brilliant - there wasn’t an empty glass in the house.
Great venue at a reasonable price on the London riverside."
V116,London Rowing Club,"LRC was the perfect place to celebrate our wedding this summer. The venue staff went above and beyond to ensure that everything went as planned both before and during the event. Thanks in particular to Annabel who was responsive, helpful and always put us at ease in the build up. The location is stunning - couldn’t have asked for a better day!"
V116,London Rowing Club,"We just wanted to say an enormous thank you for everything. From the moment we came to visit the LRC on a slightly grey January weekend, we knew it would be a fabulous venue for our June wedding reception and it certainly did not disappoint. It really is the most beautiful setting and we have very fond memories of our guests enjoying drinks in the sunshine with the most fantastic view over the Thames. The venue has such character and lends itself beautifully to a wedding reception. We have received so many compliments from our guests and I would encourage anyone thinking about booking their wedding at the LRC to do it, you will not regret it! We were lucky to be blessed with beautiful weather so were able to have our jazz musicians play on the balcony for the drinks reception before moving into the Long Room for our meal. It looked stunning with the tables dressed and mantles adorned with flowers. Following the meal and speeches, guests enjoyed drinks back on the balcony and in the Fairburn and Members Rooms which provide plenty of seating, whilst the Long Room was cleared and the band set up. We then partied the night away.

From start to finish, the organisation was so straight forward. Annabel was very accommodating and full of helpful advice in the run up. I knew that on the day she would ensure things ran like clock work, which of course they did. Our suppliers also commented on how helpful the LRC team were to work with. On the day the staff were brilliant and went out of their way to ensure everything ran smoothly (including borrowing some large gym fans from the rowers to put in the Long Room to keep us cool as it was an unexpectedly hot day). We really can’t thank you enough and now need to think of an excuse to host another party with you in the future!"
V116,London Rowing Club,"We got married in St. Mary's church and then had our reception in the London Rowing Club in February 2023. It far exceeded our expectations and was an incredible fabulous stress-free day with thanks to the wonderful Annabel making the day just run.

In the lead up to the event, Annabel was incredibly responsive, helpful and helped us plan the day exactly how we wanted it. She answered all our questions really quickly, always got back to us, was very flexible with what we could do and allowing us to personalise the space. Prior to the event, Annabel arranged for us to go and have a look around on a couple of additional occasions to help us plan how we would want it to look. She also gave our caterers a tour of the kitchens as they were new to the venue.

In the immediate lead up to the day, Annabel helped with our suppliers in getting chairs delivered and bringing all the wine over a day earlier. On the day, she helped to make the day flow and just dealt with things throughout the day.

The venue itself is beautiful with three rooms to use. A middle reception room, a cosy snug and the main long room. In the main long room, there is a rowing boat hanging upside down with fairly lights. The main lighting can be dimmed and gave a wonderful atmosphere for the evening meal. As our wedding was a winter wedding, it was fairly chilly so they lit fires in the main room and snug which added to the atmosphere.

We had around 90 guests - could have fitted a few more just about. We used the round tables, tablecloths, linen, plates cutlery and glasses provided and they were perfect for a wedding and looked very smart. No need to hire these. As mentioned, we did hire separate wedding chairs instead of the conference chairs provided. There's a lot of decoration in the way of rowing memorabilia on the walls which means you don't have to actually do too much to make it interesting for guests.

Overall, the perfect London wedding venue with absolutely fabulous views across the Thames with a long balcony to enjoy from. To top it off Annabel is truly amazing and so helpful."
V116,London Rowing Club,"We had our wedding (ceremony+reception) at LRC in July, and the venue itself and the team we worked with were absolutely incredible! Everything on the day went without a hitch and we heard so many compliments on the location - our guests loved the balcony and the layout inside, which included plenty of space for anyone wanting a break from dancing to sit down and relax. Would recommend to anyone looking to host an event!"
V116,London Rowing Club,"London Rowing Club is a truly fantastic venue and we were both so delighted with how our day went! The venue has real character with the classic rowing memorabilia and it’s location on the Thames, and looks amazing when it’s all set up. The layout and size of rooms I thought were perfect for our wedding of about 70 (+15ish more in the evenings) and of course the big attraction is the balcony which all of our guests adored!! (I wish I’d had more time during the day to stand out there and enjoy it 😂). Not only is it a fantastic venue in a great location but what really made this the most amazing venue was how great all of the staff, and all the recommend suppliers were! The day exceeded expectations and we got compliments on the place and the staff from all our guests. Couldn’t be happier with the venue, it was perfect for us!!"
V116,London Rowing Club,"We found the London Rowing Club while desperately combing through London locations after our original venue fell through a few months before the day.
Luckily for us it was available due to a cancellation - kismet!
From the start the charming Annabel put us very much at ease and helped us to envisage the day as we hoped it would be. She was very flexible and helpful throughout the planning process.
We were incredibly lucky with the weather on the day and the venue really came into its own - it was virtually impossible to get guests off the terrace, which is the perfect size for our smallish event (65 people) and of course offers gorgeous river views.
We were well looked after by the team and everything went off without a hitch. The interior of the space itself is lovely with a great sense of history.
Nice additional touch - table tennis was made available in the entry room for the later part of the evening!

It's a special place and I'd thoroughly recommend for anyone seeking a memorable spot to tie the knot!"
V116,London Rowing Club,"We got married at the London Rowing Club on a brilliantly sunny winter day on Saturday. All the way through in the run up (after 2 years or more of postponements), Annabel and team bent over backwards to help us arrange everything, recommended some brilliant suppliers for food (Shona Pollock comes highly recommended) and flowers (same with Steph the charityflorist.)

So many of our guests said how lovely the venue and staff were on the day, and the whole place looked a million dollars with an amazing photo set on and around the balcony and river - although we haven't seen those yet. The corkage and bar tariff prices are also incredibly reasonable for an inner London location!

I can't recommend the LRC highly enough. It will live in memory for a very long time."
V116,London Rowing Club,"The London Rowing Club team alongside the Dinner Ladies went above and beyond to ensure that we had the wedding perfectly fitting our requirements. Throughout the entire all of the suppliers worked seamlessly together to ensure the space transformed as we progressively added guests and transitioned between eating, our ceremony, more eating, music and dancing. We wouldn’t have had it any other way. The attention to detail of the team is second to none - perfect for any bride and groom seeking a beautiful event."
V117,The Prince Albert,"The team at The Prince Albert were always accommodating, made everything easy and stress-free, and helped us organise an amazing wedding party. They really knew what they were doing, and helped guide us through the process calmly, working around our schedule (which wasn't easy - we live abroad!) to make sure all our last-minute worries and concerns were sorted smoothly. The food was excellent, and the space was fantastic for our party. Can't recommend it highly enough!"
V117,The Prince Albert,"We had such a happy wedding with Harrison and this venue. Harrison was really flexible and answered any questions we had and made great suggestions when we needed seating arrangements, the schedule for the day, a florist, and more. The day was accessible to everyone and the food and drink were perfect. Thank you for making out wedding stress free and wonderful."
V117,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert was the most wonderful venue for our London wedding. We came across the venue at there wedding fair and chose alot of our suppliers from the same wedding fair.

Harrison and Lauren were always so on hand to help with any questions and did a fantastic job answering all of our questions. The staff were so friendly and helpful and made everything run like clockwork.

We couldn’t recommend The Prince Albert enough for a london wedding and would love to do it all again."
V117,The Prince Albert,"My wife and I were beyond happy with how everything went on our wedding day. Harrison, Diana, Claudio and the whole team were absolutely phenomenal! It was such a beautifully efficient operation, and we always felt like someone was there to help us when needed.

We've had dozens of compliments about the great food and how wonderfully intimate the venue was for a wedding. Some of our more traditional relatives said they were initially sceptical at the prospect of a pub wedding, but that it was one of the most beautiful and joyful weddings they’d been to. A friend of mine was also very happy that someone at the bar remembered her drink order throughout the evening! On top of that, everything ran perfectly to schedule, which is no doubt down to the high attention to detail.

It was very useful that the upstairs was free on Friday afternoon so that we could set up the space. It gave us plenty of time to do the flower arrangements, put up the bunting, and stick photos on the frame wall.

Thank you again so much for all the help and support you've given us - it really was the best day of our lives (so far)!"
V117,The Prince Albert,"My husband and I got married here in late September 2023, and I cannot recommend the Prince Albert enough!! Booking a wedding venue can be stressful and we felt like a lot of the venues we looked at gave us the ""hard sell"" but the folks at the Prince Albert helped to put us at ease every step of the way. We fell in love with how beautiful the pub was, so hired the upstairs for the ceremony, wedding breakfast and party afterwards for around 40 - 45 people. We were able to drop off decorations the night before and talk it all through with the staff, and they did such a good job of working with us and the florist to get the place looking amazing. The ceremony went off without a hitch, everybody loved the food and we had a blast in the evening. All the staff were amazing, but special shout out to Harrison and Lauren for helping us plan and run the day, and Maria for managing everything on the ground both when we dropped off the decorations and during the wedding itself. Thank you again for helping us celebrate our special day with our loved ones, for making it so stress free and so memorable!"
V117,The Prince Albert,"All you ever hear about wedding venues is that everything is a rip off, the food is meh, and there are a ton of annoying restrictions...the opposite is true of Harrison and The Prince Albert team. From Day 1, Harrison made the whole process not only easy but really fun! He was quick to respond, super knowledgeable, and very accommodating; he even helped our best man execute a surprise for us without it disrupting any timings. On the day, they decorated the place beautifully, managed to serve a 3 course dinner to 76 people unbelievably fast, and everyone raved about the food - to say they did a good job is a gross understatement, they went above and beyond. We were after ""classy fun"" and that's exactly what we got - thank you so so much!"
V117,The Prince Albert,"We had the exact wedding reception we wanted at the Prince Albert thanks to Harrison, Claudio and the other amazing staff who helped us feel so relaxed in the build up and during. We wanted a very low-key vibe and the team understood that but there were enough options for any style of wedding you wanted. The upstairs function room felt cozy and intimate while still leaving breathing room and space to dance, but you could easily rent the whole place if you wanted more guests and even choose to do your ceremony there. We had the most compliments on our food (we chose a buffet option). The team were particularly accomodating to some complicated dietary requirements and it was all delicious."
V117,The Prince Albert,"July 6, 2023 was the most memorable day of our lives! A big thank you to Harrison and the rest of the team for assisting us through out the whole process. Our guests loved the Prince Albert pub especially the sumptuous food and booze on our wedding day!

David & Dannah"
V117,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert is a Great venue for the classic Pub Wedding.
Harrison and the team did an amazing job to organize everything. The food was great and the service first class. Only sorry it was over so quickly. Thanks again for everything."
V117,The Prince Albert,"We found The Prince Albert when our original venue cancelled on us less than 2 months before our wedding. & we are so glad we did; everything happens for a reason! From the moment we met Harrison, we knew we were in safe hands, and the team at the Prince Albert made our day amazing. The pub looked beautiful and we were very greatful for the effort the team put in putting up all our decorations. We had so many compliments about the food, and we were very impressed in the swift and organised manner in whichever it was served. Everyone had a wonderful time, and we would not hesitate in recommending The Prince Albert."
V118,Kindred,"We chose Kindred for our 60 person wedding and it could not have been better. We wanted a venue where we could have the ceremony, dinner and dancing all under one roof, that was wheelchair accessible, and easy to get to on the tube, Kindred ticks all those boxes and more!
The food is incredible, we really enjoyed popping by to do all the tastings, we'll continue to come to the Cellar for food and cocktails. Many guests commented on how good the food was.
The place itself is gorgeous, inside and out. We used the whole venue, the main Hall for the ceremony, dinner and dancing, and the Library upstairs for the drinks reception and cake cutting. Also, being right next to Hammersmith station, the venue could not be easier to get to!
The staff are wonderfully attentive and helpful, both before and on the day. They were really open to the little details that made our day uniquely ours, from the drinks selections, to having a table and glasses on stage for the ceremony, to playing our music selections at the right time. Plus its a dog friendly venue!"
V118,Kindred,"We LOVE this venue! We got married here with only 12 weeks notice and Anna, the owner, and her staff went above and beyond to make the day as memorable, magical, and marvellous as we'd hoped it would be. The venue is elegant, stylish and perfect for a London, city based wedding. The food is sensational as it comes from their in-house kitchen on the ground floor and every guest remarked on how delicious their meal was. It's restaurant quality food, not your standard wedding food. The place looks stunning in all our wedding photos and the wedding cake they made us (at very short notice I might add!) was second to none. Everyone loved it. The venue was also perfect for late night dancing and drinking and merriment. It was such a pleasure - and a breeze - to work with Anna and her team on one of the most important days of my life, and I very much hope to do so again in the future. I will forever be grateful to her and all she helped us with."
V118,Kindred,"We had our wedding reception for 35 guests at Kindred, in the Library and Salon earlier this year. The day went incredibly smoothly, the staff couldn't have been more attentive and our guests raved about the food for weeks afterwards. It was the perfect sized space for our intimate celebration, really cosy and the atmosphere was great. The little touches really helped to make the day special, with espresso martinis served for the speeches and sparklers for our exit at the end of the night. Thanks again to the lovely Kindred team!"
V118,Kindred,"I cannot find a single fault in our experience with Kindred for our wedding. Not only was it a stunning venue that honestly made some of our guests gasp as they arrived, but Anna and the team were so incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. Having them support us really took so much of the wedding planning stress away and we knew we were in safe hands. I really appreciated that the team were happy to chat through ideas with me and were always keen to find creative solutions to give us the day that we had envisioned.

The food was absolutely delicious and they were so accommodating for our long list of dietary requirements from our guest. The cocktails were also so delicious. Our guests were buzzing for weeks after, as were we.

On the night, the staff were not only incredibly helpful and efficient, but also just so friendly, welcoming and complimentary. We felt thoroughly spoilt and very well looked after.

We visited so many venues and this was by far the best choice for us. The interiors made for some stunning photos and the layout of the spacing meant that whilst we had 80-100 guests, it still felt very intimate. I cannot recommend Kindred enough!"
V118,Kindred,"We would give a thousand stars if we could. Kindred hosted us for our cocktail style wedding and it was everything we could have hoped for and the perfect venue for this style of wedding. The wine, cocktails and food (incredible grazing board, canapés, bowls and pizzas) were exceptional and the team were on top of everything, friendly and nothing was ever an issue. We would HIGHLY recommend it. We have had loads of guests message us to tell us what a spectacular venue it was with the most friendly team. The venue had different spaces to suit our needs and the AV is amazing - it worked perfectly for our live music band and our DJ, and our own music playlists for our ceremony. They took the stress off planning and really did mean we could relax and not worry that everything would run smoothly. Thank you so much Kindred team for giving us the best day of our lives"
V119,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The best day of our lives and me and my now husband couldn't be more thankful to Bredenbury. Before booking Bredenbury we visited over 17 wedding venues in Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Herefordshire - we fell in love instantly, there is no need for a crazy amount of extra expense on decorations, the venue speaks for itself. The fact that it was no corkage just added to why we wanted to book and the team were so friendly. In the lead up to the wedding they were brilliant, we booked far in advance and brought over all our family members to come see the venue, they were so flexible, understanding and welcoming - they couldn't do enough for us. On the wedding day they had decorated for us by the time we had arrived and all we had to do on the day was to enjoy it - which was perfect. It really was the best day of our lives, all the comments from our family and friends was how beautiful the venue was. They kept the day running so smooth and we didn't need to think about a thing."
V119,Bredenbury Court Barns,"There truly aren't words to describe how incredible Bredenbury Court Barns and their entire team of fantastic staff were through the planning process and the day itself. They were so friendly, supportive and nothing was ever too much. From quick replies to any questions that popped to mind to planning meetings that left us feeling prepared and ready to the day being set up beyond perfectly. Our amazing wedding coordinator Lianna spent the days and months (years really!) leading up to our big day making sure everyone detail was perfect, that everything was incorporated that we'd dreamed of and made sure we didn't feel a moment of stress from start to finish. All throughout the building from the bridal booth, to the orangery to the oak barn was beautifully light and open - even with our wedding being the end of October - and we had so many compliments about this! There aren't enough words to say thank you and explain just how much we'd recommend this venue to everyone"
V119,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We had the perfect day back in July. The weather didn't go to plan but they helped make the day so special even with the last minute switches because of the rain. We had such an amazing day and the feedback from our guests about the venue, food and service was great! We cannot thank the team enough for the effort they put in throughout the whole process but especially on the day. We felt incredibly supported throughout the whole process."
V119,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The venue itself is stunning. The buildings, grounds and interior decorations are all beautiful and immaculately presented. From the moment you turn down the lane it is so picturesque, you know you've found somewhere special. It's exactly what we were imagining for our wedding venue.

The layout is perfect, with ample space for guests to mingle and move about, and great accessibility for older and disabled guests. Ours was a winter wedding, and while most of the day was inside it wasn't cramped and we could still enjoy the beautiful grounds through the expansive windows that run along the whole barn.

All of the venue is stunning, but practicality-wise the Bridal Suite warrants a special mention. Room length mirrors, plenty of room for the bridal party to get ready, have their makeup and hair done, and if there's time to relax as well. Drinks were served from 11 onwards, and it has it's own toilets and shower.

From our first meeting at Bredenbury the staff were exceptional. They gave a reassuring air of professionalism and experience, with just the right level of excitedness for our day without it feeling forced. We were really impressed by how responsive the whole team were, with speedy replies to any questions we had during the planning. This is something we particularly appreciated as we only gave ourselves 7 weeks to plan our big day.

Value for money wise it felt tricky to gauge when we were trying to choose a venue as the headline figure is rarely what you'll end up paying, with different venues charging different amounts for different things. Not the case with Bredenbury. With their No Corkage policy and generosity in being able to use whatever props they already have, any extras were non-essentials of our own choosing.

No Corkage is pretty significant. Some venues wanted to charge £20/bottle, so not having to pay this and being able to supply not only our own wine but beers, gin and soft drinks for the drinks reception and wedding breakfast was not only a massive saving but also made the occasion more personal for us. The bar staff and catering team were excellent, pouring and serving drinks, warming our mulled wine and setting up the gin bar. Once your guests have drunk you dry the venue's bar is well stocked and standard pub pricing.

We wanted a Christmas wedding and seeing in early November that they had a date available that December we couldn't resist. 7 weeks isn't long to organise a wedding with nearly 100 guests, and we couldn't have done it without the Bredenbury team being so organised. Our assigned event manager, Harriet, was brilliant in the runup and on the day, as were all the other managers and staff we spoke with. The Wedding Bible they fill out with you is a great idea and nails down all the finer details to ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible on the day.

We didn't want to have to spend the day before and morning of our wedding worrying about set up and decorations, but needn't have worried as Bredenbury did all of this for us. A meeting beforehand clarified what we wanted where; we simply dropped off boxes of stuff the day before and rocked up in the morning to find everything laid out as hoped.

This organisation extended to the third party suppliers, of which Bredenbury have an extensive list of local recommendations. We booked the ceiling lights with Cotswold Wedding Co. and didn't have to do anything else. The band, Apollo Gold (incredible!!) set up without any hassle and didn't have any issues with Bredenbury's noise limiter. Our florist Katrina Bevis hadn't been there before, but again had no problem getting everything in place on the morning.

On-site accommodation was good for close family and friends, but there's not enough for the majority of guests and the lack of a dedicated honeymoon suite is a bit of a shame. If you want privacy for your first night as a married couple it means taking over an entire lodge. The quality and comfort of the rooms is excellent, though, and the continental breakfast served the morning after in the East Lodge was delicious, with ample options for Vegan and Gluten Free.

Jenkinsons are the exclusive caterer for Bredenbury and have an extensive menu for nibbles, the wedding breakfast and dinner. The menu and ordering process is clear, and pricing is what we expected to pay. Food and service was as slick and faff-free as everything else. A real delight.

On the day, Harriet and the catering manager were absolute superstars. Zero stress, everything ran to time and as planned, and they were always available if we had any questions or needed help.

The whole day was perfect and exactly what we wanted. I don't think we could have achieved this without the exceptional organisation of Harriet and the team. The entire process was very slick, zero stress, and we wouldn't hesitate in recommending Bredenbury Court Barns to anyone looking to get married in a countryside paradise."
V119,Bredenbury Court Barns,"I want to say a massive thank you to Bredenbury Court Barns for hosting our wedding. From the start they were super amazing and accommodating to us. They won us over with their care and support even when we had a pickle in the beginning.

Olivia was super helpful from the start and throughout the year we were planning she offered huge amount of support and suggestions.

We typed in “orangery weddings” in google when we were first looking because I was keen to get a ceremony in an orangery and Bredenbury popped up after much searching. Once we saw the Orangery we cancelled every other viewing we had across the country because we felt we found the perfect place, and nothing compared to the reception with the beautiful windows that brought all the light in. The grounds were absolutely spectacular and gorgeous. It was a no brainer for us to pick such a beautiful venue. They brought my ideas to life and we were able to get support on anything from recommendation of suppliers, to ideas on decor to their favourite meals from Jenkinson’s. They fully outdid themselves in love for us. We can’t forget it.

Our wedding day was exceptional with Lianna helping us all the way. She was a breath of fresh air. She cared about all the little details and made us feel relaxed and had a good laugh with us. The fact she was there 100% of the way, before the wedding, during the wedding, and even after is unmatched! Thank you Lianna for really being there to make our wedding day smooth and relaxing.

The food was incredible too and we often think about how sad it is that we didn’t finish our second plates, we think about it a lot.

Thank you for the wonderful journey BCB, you blew us away with your integrity, kindness, and genuine support!"
V119,Bredenbury Court Barns,thank you to everyone at bredenbury court barns who made our day so special
V119,Bredenbury Court Barns,"From the moment we stepped foot into Bredenbury Court Barns, we knew this was the venue for us. It was the first and only venue we viewed as we were blown away by how gorgeous the venue is. The venue itself is absolutely stunning, with breathtaking views and impeccably maintained grounds that set the perfect backdrop for our special day.

The staff went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. From our first consultation to the last dance, their professionalism and attention to detail were exceptional. Harriet was absolutely brilliant and I don’t know what we would have done without her!

The food was another highlight—our guests are still talking about how delicious everything was! Jenkinsons are amazing, they helped us personalise our menu perfectly!

We couldn’t have asked for a more beautiful venue to have our wedding. The day couldn’t have been more perfect! Thank you to everyone at Bredenbury Court Barns for making our wedding day nothing short of magical!"
V119,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We could not have had a more perfect experience with Bredenbury Court Barns. Right from initial booking all the way through to breakfast the following morning, everything was perfect. Nothing was too much trouble for our wonderful planner, Lianna. She ensured the day ran smoothly and our months of planning turned out exactly as we’d imagined. They are available to answer any questions you have any time, they’re only an email away and get back to you so fast. The venue itself if just gorgeous, the grounds make for some wonderful photos, and the orangery lets so much light in that your ceremony photos are gorgeous. The whole place is fully air conditioned too which was great for our July wedding. The bridal suite is a perfect balance of being aesthetically pleasing and practical for getting ready in, it’s so spacious, lots of natural light, there’s plenty of plug sockets and huge mirrors so everyone has plenty of room for getting ready and no one is on top of eachother. There’s even an outside space for getting some fresh air. I’m so glad we chose to have our wedding here, it’s given us memories to cherish forever and there are zero memories of any stress!! Cannot recommend this venue enough!"
V119,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We cannot believe how lucky we fell to get married at such a beautiful venue. Right from the offset of viewing the venue, to our special day, we were taken of. No question was too silly, and so much pressure was taken off us during the planning. We managed to make everything our own and Lianna was there every step of the way. Thank you for giving us our happily ever after. We will forever be grateful."
V119,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We loved our wedding at Bredenbury the team did an amazing job providing everything we asked for and more. We especially liked that our wedding coordinator for the day, Harriet had thought of everything for us she went above and beyond and even offered to go and get my mum some more shoes when hers broke! absolute 5-star service and the food was amazing too!"

V121,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow what can I say, Brinsop is an absolutely stunning wedding venue with heaps of character and so many options of places for the ceremony and to do things. We fell in love with it as soon as we saw it and knew it was where we wanted to get married.

Right from the start, the Brinsop team were so helpful and accommodating. From giving an virtual tour then showing us around in person, Issy and the team were fantastic right the way through. Nothing was a hassle, no request too difficult and they were incredibly professional and responsive throughout the whole process.

We loved that Brinsop is an exclusive venue with accommodation on site so we could stay with the bridal party and our immediate family. All the rooms are unique and have so much character and it's fun exploring the whole place. You feel like you are in the middle of nowhere, in nature with swans, ducks and birds all around.

Throughout our planning process, Issy and the team helped us every step of the way, being incredibly flexible in managing our requests and really trying to create our vision. They even got their team to make a giant jenga that we could use on the day! They helped to create the most perfect bespoke wedding breakfast and canapes menu, and seemed so positive and excited to be part of our special day and experience.

Arriving at the venue, Issy and the team were ready and had everything prepared and ready to go. It made the process so smooth for us and meant we could really enjoy the day without any stress. Issy coordinated perfectly with all of our vendors and it really felt like she and the whole team were so happy for us and wanted to be part of our day which was amazing. Our guests commented on how friendly and responsive all the staff were and it really made the experience extra special.

I wouldn't change anything about the day and it was perfect. I would absolutely recommend Brinsop as a wedding venue and all the staff who are really invested in helping deliver your vision. Thank you so so much to the whole team for making this a day that we will look back on for many years to come with amazing memories."
V121,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow, what a perfect day we had! It really went without a hitch and that was thanks to Nina and all the staff at Brinsop. The team worked seamlessly to ensure the day was as perfect as could be, and it really was! The wedding was booked over 2 years in advance and the staff were so accommodating with all my questions, planning and site visits, they couldn’t do more to support us. Special thanks to our coordinator Nina who was a delight to work with and a credit to Brinsop. Everyone that attended agreed at how beautiful the venue and grounds were, it was a wedding people won’t forget! 10/10 would recommend to anyone!"
V121,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"It's taken me quite a while to get round to writing this review, because sadly it's quite a bittersweet one.

We were married last year on 15 June and Brinsop was our chosen venue for both our ceremony and reception. We were first attracted to brinsop by the accomodation, meaning our loved ones could stay on-site, especially my grandparents which was so important to me.

The home itself is absolutely beautiful, including ivy cottage which myself and my mum stayed in the night before the big day. It really was a picture perfect setting, and looking down from the bridal suite seeing the ceremony space being set up on the Wordsworth lawn was honestly magical. Id dreamed of an outdoor wedding on that lawn, and we were so grateful the weather cleared so we could have it. The team really did wait till the latest they could to ask us to make a call on an inside or outside wedding (despite being June, it was a gloomy day to start) which I really appreciated!

Another amazing part of hiring brinsop was the after hours space we were able to enjoy until 2am with our house guests. The games room was absolute fantastic and meant that if you wanted to go to bed you could, but you could also stay up, party and play pool. I really do think this was a highlight for our guests and would recommend massively if you can spare some budget.

On the night of the wedding, myself and my new husband actually stayed in one glamping tents which we absolutely loved. The groundsman was on site until we were ready to leave the games room, and he then took us up to our tent in one of the buggies, making sure we had plenty of blankets and even stopping off for some bottles of water for us. This was really special, and can't thank him enough.

Hugo Spritz!! Having hugos at both our welcome drinks and drinks reception after the ceremony was amazing. I'm not a fan of prosecco myself and Mark and the team made it possible for us to have Hugo's all round. We even sneaked some up to the bridal suite to have before the ceremony (thanks Nadia!). Our guests loved them, and the amount of people that have told me they now need them at their own wedding is crazy!

Onto the not so good - sadly it all started to go a little downhill when we moved things into the knot barn for our wedding breakfast. Sitting on the top table, I could see that guests at the top of the second rows of long tables didn't really even have a seat around the table and were just kind of plonked on. The seating plan hadn't been followed, and I don't think there were even enough tables laid for the service to be comfortable for people because there was a dance floor at the end of the barn (which I did not ask for).

It was quickly also brought to my attention, that one of our guests had had to put her child on her lap in order to remove the high chair so people had more space. We also lost about 5 napkins with them setting on fire from the candles because everything was just way too cramped.

I asked to speak to catering, and asked if there was anything that they could do. I was told 'well sure, if you want the whole thing to be late'. In truth I shouldn't have even had to broach this myself, as it should have been sorted by the coordination team.

The tables weren't changed, even after they'd said they'd sort after the first course and yet the whole meal still ran late. We've had so much feedback about people not having enough food, food not being easy to access on the sharing platters etc and honestly when you've waited so long for a day and had spent 25k on the venue and food alone, it really has been heartbreaking to hear. I do sometimes question why people still bring it up (even now, people talk about the dining) when it clearly upset me so much.

Whilst writing this review my husband asked my what we had for evening food - we didn't get any. It was left unannounced on a back table. I don't know what I was expecting, just not that.

The next morning, the houseguests were asked to come down to breakfast for 9am (it was on a note in the room) but as we were in the glamping area, we walked past the knot barn just before 8.30 and the food was already out. We ran down to the house to hurry everyone up, and by which time everyone arrived it had been sitting there for 20plus mins going cold.

My biggest upset was that when I fed all of the above back to brinsop, feeling pretty deflated about the catering, I was told they'd pass my feedback on and heard absolutely nothing back. 25k total with over 10k on food and drinks to hear absolutely nothing, and this was 9 months ago. I'm not saying this in would happen to anyone else, but really - it shouldn't have happened to us either."
V121,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our wedding! From start to finish, everything at Brinsop was flawless. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most magical backdrop for our special day. Our guests were blown away by the beautiful venue, the warm atmosphere, and the seamless coordination. Every detail was taken care of, and we felt so well looked after. The team was incredible, professional, friendly, and attentive. On the day itself, they ensured everything ran smoothly, allowing us to truly enjoy every moment. A special mention goes to our amazing wedding coordinator Nina!"
V121,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We had our wedding on New Year's Eve 2024 at Brinsop, and it was more perfect that we could have ever hoped for. The venue itself is stunning, with beautiful spacious rooms which slept over 40 of our guests. Our coordinator, Nina, was incredible and so supportive on the day - she kept everything running so smoothly and everything went by without a glitch. The food and drink managers Mark and Amy did the most incredible job - nothing was ever too much, they were so attentive, and the chefs the most stunning meal after we gave them a fairly vague brief of 'curry'! We had the most perfect day and we're so incredibly grateful to Brinsop and the team."
V121,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,Brinsop Court is pure magic—an unforgettable venue with an incredible team!
V121,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We were lucky enough to have our wedding at Brinsop Court in December, and it was an absolutely spectacular day. We fell in love with Brinsop as soon we set our eyes on the beautiful manor and surrounding gardens. Cate, Amy, Mark and the rest of the wonderful staff at Brinsop really go the extra mile to make you feel special, and are extremely flexible with requests in order to make your day feel more special. We honestly felt like there was no request too big leading up to the day and they really made us feel extremely comfortable leading up to the day.
On the day, Cate and her team were well on hand to help us with setting up everything and she had everything under control when there were a few hiccups. The day itself was absolutely magical, and that wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for everyone at Brinsop working extremely hard to ensure that everything went to plan and as smoothly as it could.
Thank you to everyone at Brinsop for making us feel at ease and ensuring that our wedding was an amazing day."
V121,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Brinsop, the perfect wedding venue! We got married at Brinsop in December and I can honestly say it was everything we could have hoped for and more. We found out about the venue through Hitched and was one of only two venues that we visited but as soon as we got the house we knew it was the one. We fell in love with everything about it and it was fair to say that our guests agreed with us with many saying it was the nicest venue they’d been to. We had the wonderful Nina as our coordinator and she was brilliant! Nothing was too much trouble and we had constant communication with her in the build up which helped our stress levels no end. The same can be said for all of the staff who were brilliant throughout and allowed us to have the best day of our lives with everything running seamlessly. A special mention must be given to Amy and the catering staff who put on such an incredible menu (including the tasting session that provided some of the best food we’d ever had) and ensured that the food has been one of the main things that people have mentioned to us since the wedding! We had our ceremony in the Banqueting Hall which provided the perfect setting, especially with it being a winter wedding, as it really added to the cosy atmosphere and the lounge areas/games room were perfect for the drink’s reception. We would have loved to have also had it in the courtyard, but the temperatures meant that the lounge with the fireplace was a far more appealing option on the day. We then had the wedding breakfast and reception in the knot barn which was decorated beautifully and was the perfect place for the party in the evening. Overall we really can’t thank everyone at Brinsop enough for making our day what it was, we can honestly say that we have been made to feel part of the family and already can’t wait to hopefully come back to stay in one of the cottages for our first anniversary!"
V121,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Where do I start!!
Brinop Court is the most stunning venue, it was the first venue we visited and instantly fell in love! Theres so much history to the house and we were treated like family every time we visited before the wedding and it literally felt like home the whole weekend of the wedding, my guests also agreed!!

A special thank you to Issy our coodinator who went above and beyond ti make sure everything was perfect for us. It was so easy to plan and nothing was too much to ask, even arranging our dog to be our ring bearer!! When they say Brinsop is dog friendly they really mean it!!!

What a place, what a day!! Thank you so much everyone, you all made our day perfect and it really was the best day of our lives♥️"
V121,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We got married at the gorgeous Brinsop in October this year. It’s hard to put into words how amazing the whole experience was. We honestly had the best day of our lives!!!

We fell in love with Brinsop during our first visit back in December 2022. We knew almost immediately that Brinsop was the venue we were looking for! From the outside the venue looked like a painting - from the picturesque views of the countryside, to the swans swimming on the moat! The manor house itself has so much character, and has a lovely homely feel to it as you walk around it. Our guests were equally blown away by the venue!

A big thing for us was that it’s dog friendly, which meant we could have our two dogs join us on our special day, it wouldn’t have been the same without them there! They had so much fun walking around the grounds and greeting all of our guests!

Nina, our coordinator, and her team were always available to answer any of our questions in the run up to the day. This really put us at ease, knowing we were in safe hands. On the day, Nina and the team made sure everything ran smoothly and went above and beyond to ensure our guests were looked after. A shout out to Amy who heads up catering and Mark who manages the bar. The food and drinks were absolutely fantastic!

I highly recommend this venue! There’s a reason Brinsop is an award winning venue - and when you visit it’s not hard to see why. We are already looking forward to going back there for a date night next year! Thanks for everything Team Brinsop!

V122,The Manor at Bickley,"The Manor is the perfect venue for weddings! When our wedding venue fell through 4 months before the big day, I stumbled onto the Manor at Bickley and spoke to Craig. He was most helpful and kind and went above and beyond to make sure our wedding went ahead.

We hired the venue for our two day wedding and the staff were helpful and accommodating from start to finish. All of our guests were awed by the beautiful well kept grounds and the excellent service. We can’t thank the staff enough for making our wedding dreams a reality. They thought of every detail from bringing us champagne after our civil ceremony to making sure we had our card box at the end of the night! We are excited to head back to celebrate our anniversary there!"
V122,The Manor at Bickley,"Myself and my Husband chose this venue for our wedding last week and we can’t sing The Manor’s praises enough. From our very first enquiry, to the first viewing of the venue, right though until the big day, the staff at the manor have been nothing short of brilliant! Each staff member we came across was polite and accommodating. Special mention to Craig and Vicky with whom we did most of our liaising throughout the months leading up until our wedding. Craig and Vicky were super helpful, responsive and went above and beyond to make sure that we could have the day of our dreams. Even with last minute changes due to the weather, Craig who was just incredible throughout, managed to help us sort a backup plan so our day would still go ahead seamlessly.

The rooms at the manor were spacious and modern, giving us and our wedding party lots of space for photographers and videographers to capture the special moments on our wedding morning.

The lodge that was used for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready was fabulous. The manor was very flexible in giving us early access so we could get ready on time.

The grand marquee was definitely grand! Very spacious and when decorated looked like something out of a fairytale! lots of kitchen space, a huge bar and fantastic overhead speakers for the party!

The manor was super flexible to our needs regarding access, start times, outsourcing our vendors and much more. The venue is beautiful and spacious with options for outdoor and indoor events and entertainment. The grounds were absolutely beautiful, so many lovely spots for photos not only for us as the bride and groom but for guests too!

A very special thank you to our point of contact throughout, Craig. From our first meeting, he was charming, bubbly and made us feel super welcome. He reassured us that he has experience in African/Caribbean weddings and that our wedding day would amazing and it was. He was attentive and always let us know that he was only a phone call or e-mail away and was always quick to respond and answer any questions we had.

All in all, we had the most beautiful day at The manor and we would definitely recommend this venue for a wedding or other events.

V122,The Manor at Bickley,"We hired The Manor at Bickley for my daughters wedding. Got a brilliant service from the venue. Everything was set accordingly, as per floor plan. Our guests were loved the venue grounds/facilities and the overall wedding set up.
Thank you to everyone at Bickley."
V122,The Manor at Bickley,"A warm and friendly service from the very helpful staff, a feeling that it is your own house! The food was amazing and the atmosphere made us and our guests feel fantastic."
V123,Davenport House,We are so pleased we chose Davenport House for our wedding reception. Charley and the team were so helpful and thoughtful. Putting canapés behind the bar for us and making sure everything ran so smoothly. I am obsessed with the stunning house and grounds and it was absolutely perfect! Thank you so much for making our day so special!!
V123,Davenport House,"Davenport House is a STUNNING wedding venue so how could we not have it for our big day!?

The staff were exceptional! From the moment we booked through to our big day, we had an absolute blast and could not thank each member of staff enough! Special shout out to Jared (hopefully spelt right, haha!) who made sure we were fed, watered and ensured we took 5 minutes to ourselves every moment we could - Also even saved us slices of pie wedding cake before we went to bed!

Our guests have said they have never been to a wedding so spectacular, with the most amazing food and amazing staff so could not have been happier having Davenport as our venue! 🩷"
V123,Davenport House,"I just wanted to write to say a huge, enormous thank you to Charley and all the team at Davenport House. We still can’t believe how perfect our day was, and lots of our guests have told us it’s the best wedding they’ve ever been to. The team were all a huge part of making that happen. It was incredibly seamless and well planned on the day, meaning we genuinely didn’t have to think about a thing, except for enjoying ourselves. The day ran to schedule perfectly and even certain touches we didn’t know or expect to happen were planned by you and the team, which made the day even more special. Thank you so much for giving us our dream wedding day. We can’t wait to see the full set of pictures and the video now to relive it all!"
V123,Davenport House,"Without doubt the best day of our lives. From start to finish, Davenport has exceeded expectations. From the very first impression of the venue during the open day, the incredible food tasting evening, all the way through to the day itself, including the support and preparation leading up to it. It was really important to us to pick a venue that not only ticked the fairytale box, but also come with the complete support of a wedding planner, due to our busy jobs. We were lucky enough to have Charley as ours. She really took the time to listen and get to know us, to ensure the day was tailored to exactly what we wanted. We even had our own cocktail designed, which went down an absolute storm on the day! She considered every little detail, constantly putting our minds at ease, which made the whole process so easy and enjoyable. Honestly the day couldn’t have gone smoother, any anxiety or stress faded immediately as soon as we got to the venue. It was simply perfect. So many of our guests were complimentary of just how beautiful the venue is and just how well organised the day was, and that is the perfect way to summarise Davenport. Any prospective couples thinking of selecting Davenport as their venue, hesitate no further. It will be a day you never knew was possible! We cannot thank you enough Charley and the Davenport team, if only we could live the day over and over again"
V123,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was amazing. When looking for a venue we weren't just looking for something wow, we needed to have people who were enthused and passionate about their work - we found that at Davenport House.

From our first phone call & meeting with Lizzie and Tallulah, we knew this was the place for us. Having two brides wasn’t an issue; combining British, Asian and Spanish cultures - wasn't an issue; having brides enter together – wasn’t an issue. Nothing was an issue. At Davenport House, we got it all – a picturesque venue and the best team of staff anyone could ever wish for. All our external suppliers have commented what a fantastic venue you are. All out guests have said that the service and attention to detail was second to none. The thoughtful touches like hiring a Spanish speaking waiter for the table which spoke very little English ensured that everyone felt welcomed. Guests with dietary requirements didn't feel they got a second rate meal or they were an afterthought - the food for all throughout the day was exceptional. The rooms / cottages where our guests and we stayed, spotless and comfortable. The thought behind adding some cheese and Spanish ham to the morning breakfast - so sweet!

Special shout out to Megan - wedding planner extraordinaire who kept in touch throughout the planning process and was exceptional on the day. Ian who worked tirelessly to ensure the day ran smoothly and the food was perfect, Charley who was also in charge of one bride and ensuring that everything was on point. All the staff were fantastic - polite, professional and personal.

Everyone keeps saying that this was the best wedding they have ever attended and that’s a lot of weddings between people! When we asked why, they say things like ‘the venue’, ‘the staff’, but it all came back to the inclusivity, love & joy that they felt – and you were all a part of that.

Davenport House is a stunning venue made even better by those who work there. If you want the whole package on your wedding day, we strongly recommend you book them.

Thank you to the entire Davenport House team.

Sat and Ana xx"
V123,Davenport House,"Where to begin with our beautiful venue and thanking the people who made it all happen! We got married in November at Davenport House and it was easily the best day of our lives. We chose Davenport because we wanted to host our cosy winter wedding in a big grand house in the country, with all the grandeur and class but to still feel like an intimate celebration with our family and closest friends, and it was perfect in delivering just that. It is utterly beautiful, the location was perfect and exactly what we wanted. The food was absolutely AMAZING, we had so many compliments from our guests and we are so grateful for the team in delivering such a fabulous wedding breakfast. Thank you so much to Lizzie who couldn’t do more to help us have our dream day, and Ian who delivered the best service to us and our guests (the pizza at 2am was very much appreciated)

Massive massive thank you to Charley our wedding planner, who was so so helpful throughout our wedding planning process and on the day, I can’t thank her enough. She was always there whenever I needed her, helped me so much with creating our dream day and I will be forever grateful to her for keeping me sane! Whenever I had any worries I knew she was just a phone call away, which helped me a lot when planning a wedding!

Charley, Lizzie and Ian thank you for everything - best team ever. Our day was seamless and it was all down to you and your incredible team.

Jess and Sam xx"
V123,Davenport House,"Me and my (now) wife chose Davenport House as our wedding venue in mid 2022, to get married in September 2023, and it was the best decision we could have made. We looked at a range of Georgian style manor house type venues located in Cheshire, North Wales and the West Midlands areas. It blew all of the competition away in terms of the venue aesthetics, the balance in design (i.e. period characteristics vs modern design), the impressive condition of the property for its age plus what it offered for our wedding weekend.

Staff and service - In the UK, this is usually something that is average at best - if you're lucky. At Davenport House, the service from all staff was 10/10. I honestly don't think we've ever had better service for anything. We had a wedding planner from the start (Megan), who was an absolute saint and was fundamental in making the whole wedding a success. She was also instrumental in helping us find a way for our 'little' dog Bernie to be a part of the main event. Thanks Megan!

Accommodation - The fantastic condition, design and decor for Davenport House extends to all areas of the estate. The rooms are fantastic, very big, well maintained and cleaned religiously by the venue. We had no issues or problems from all of the guests who stayed onsite over the 3 days.

Food and drink - This got a lot of deserved praise from the guests too. We got to tailor our entire menu and it worked perfectly for what we wanted for the 3 days. The oyster bar and luxurious charcuterie board went down particularly well the day before the wedding.

I could keep writing much, much more on how fantastic this venue was for our wedding. But the best advice I could give for any interested couples is to go and visit it in person and reach out to Davenport House with any questions. Our own wedding ended up becoming both perfect and the best wedding we've ever been to. Thanks guys again!"
V123,Davenport House,"Fantastic location.
Great staff.
Beautiful place to get married.
I can wait to film here again soon thanks for having me."
V123,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was a fairytale, everything we could have dreamed of and more. Lizzie and Charley were fantastic in their support, organisation and professionalism in planning our wedding. The venue is simply spectacular- breathtaking. Our guests were blown away. The day ran so smoothly it was simply perfect. The food was out of this world our guests couldn't get enough. All the staff at the house went above and beyond to ensure we were happy and having a great day. The team were also extremely supportive of last minute changes/additions. The Davenport experience was truly wonderful and I'm sad to see it end right from our initial meetings, food tasting and finally our special day. Thank you: Lizzie, Charley, Ian and all of the team for a truly memorable day for us and our guests. Mr and Mrs Kissane"
V123,Davenport House,"We got married at Davenport House in February and they provided us with the most perfect day. Lizzie, Charley, Ian and the rest of the team were the best hosts we could have hoped for. Nothing was too much to ask and the guests all commented on the hospitality shown to them. The setting is utterly gorgeous, our weather was less than favourable so we did not make the most of the grounds but this didn't matter, the house was setting enough and so atmospheric! The food was utterly AMAZING and better than most restaurant food I have eaten. The venue feels intimate and grand at the same time.
I literally cannot recommend this place enough, they gave us the wedding we had always wanted and more!"

V125,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge on 12 May 2023 and it was incredible. The views are gorgeous and the photo opportunities are endless with beautiful floral and green surroundings. The team were super responsive throughout the process which is really reassuring and helpful when planning a wedding, and Nelson who ran the day was just fantastic. Every single detail was thought of and they run a really slick operation. This is essential as it meant I had a lot less to think about! They put me and my partner at ease throughout. The food and service on the day was fantastic, so many of our guests said this was the best food they’ve ever had at a wedding. Highly recommend! (Photos by Costa Weddings UK)"
V125,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","Pembroke where super helpful and provided a lot of guidance in helpful forms and layouts. Always available for a call and very helpful. on the day, it ran super smooth and and staff where lovely. Thank yo for making it a great day!"
V125,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge in October 2024. The whole day was magical, including the beautiful view over the autumn trees in Richmond Park. Robert made sure everything ran perfectly and helped us to find slots in the busy wedding timetable to fit in some special moments to also reflect traditions from my husband's Dutch culture. The food was great and the staff were polite and fun. All preparation with Lucy was also smooth and done with a smile. The Pembroke Lodge team ooze experience but make every wedding feel special and really listen to your wishes for the day. Highly recommend! Thank you to the whole Pembroke Lodge team, especially Robert, Lucy, the kitchen team and the staff on the day!"
V125,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park",The staff has been very helpful. They have a lot of experience. Open to any suggestions and help in critical situations.
V125,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue than Pembroke Lodge for our summer wedding. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most gorgeous backdrop for our special day. A huge thank you to our banqueting manager, Nelson, who went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly.

The team was incredibly supportive and accommodating throughout the planning process, making it an enjoyable and stress-free experience. Their professionalism and attention to detail made all the difference, and we’re so grateful for everything they did to make our day unforgettable. Highly recommend!"
V125,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We got married on the 3rd of October this year, and the team made our day magical! What a smooth day. We loved every second of it! The guests loved everything, and raved about the food and organisation.
Hiring Pembroke Lodge was easy. We had a viewing where all information was shared in detail and super clear to understand and make a decision.
On the months leading up to the big day our contact was Alice. Alice is a star. Responsive, professional, and had answers and solutions to everything.
On the day, Nelson coordinated the whole thing, minute by minute, and we are forever grateful for his politeness, professionalism and high spirits. We felt safe and in good hands. I would give Pembroke Lodge way over 5 stars if I could :)"
V125,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","My wedding went without a hitch, thanks to the amazing team at Pembroke Lodge (special thanks to Nicola & Robert)! They made sure everything was set up perfectly on the day, exactly in the way we had requested, and then ensured the day itself went as smoothly as we could've hoped. Everything looked beautiful and the stunning views made all of our guests fall in love with the venue too."
V125,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had the most perfect day. The team have all been so responsive and accommodating of our every request. The venue is beautiful and we were lucky to have gorgeous sunset views. It is truly a countryside wedding but conveniently close to London, which was important for our overseas guests. The food was fantastic and staff were professional and efficient. Would recommend to anyone."
V125,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We recently had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge, and I cannot say enough good things about the venue, the team and manager, Robert. From the moment we started planning to the big day itself, he was absolutely incredible.

Robert went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. He was always available to answer our questions, offer solutions, and provide creative suggestions that enhanced our vision. He coordinated effortlessly with our vendors, making sure everyone was on the same page, which took so much stress off our shoulders.

On the day of the wedding, he was a true rockstar! He made sure the timeline flowed perfectly, from setting up the ceremony space to ensuring the reception transitions were seamless. His dedication and hands-on approach allowed us to enjoy every moment without worrying about a single thing.

Our wedding was a dream come true, and we owe so much of that to him and the team! Thank you, for everything you all did to make our day magical."
V125,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We could not have wished for a better wedding venue for our special day! Everyone went above and beyond to make sure our day goes perfectly without us having to worry about a single thing! A big shoutout to Nelson who was absolutely brilliant and made the day feel so calm and well thought through.

The food was delicious and all the team was so welcoming and super helpful on the day.

Thank you so much, we really really appreciate all the help!"
V126,The Hackney,"If you are having a wedding for under 60 people then this is your place! From start to finish the communication and planning of the wedding was seamless and took so much of the stress out of the day. The totally customisable packages that they offer really does suit anyone’s budget and more importantly regardless of what package you end up going for it is value for money. The food was delicious and it catered to everyone’s tastes including a pregnant guest, halal, vegan and lactose intolerant and was the talking point for our guests. The venue itself is stunning! Lots of exposed brick, they had recently redecorated before our wedding and the reception room that doubled up as the dance floor was styled simply but made a statement and the outdoor covered patio area was a welcome addition. The team understood our vision from the get go and they completely nailed it, all of our guests couldn’t believe it was here! I honestly can’t recommend it enough if you’re wanting a small and intimate wedding venue but still with all the class. I would say to future couples even if you think this wouldn’t be your venue please please do have a proper look because it will change your mind, I had come across this venue multiple times over the course of a year and decided to take a leap of faith and give it a chance and we’re so happy we did."
V126,The Hackney,"We can’t recommend the Hackney highly enough. They made the whole process so easy and they offer so much in-house which we took advantage of. The food was especially great - our guests were amazed “best food I’ve ever had at a wedding” and the team took great care of us during the planning stages.

They offer a very customisable service with scalable pricing. If you’re having a fairly small wedding (under 60) then you must check out The Hackney.

We had such a perfect day and we owe so much of that to the fabulous venue. Beautiful space, so professionally run."
V126,The Hackney,"We had such a brilliant experience working with the team at The Hackney. We were regularly in touch throughout the planning process and the use of the shared spreadsheet was especially handy for keeping everyone informed.
We had to postpone our wedding two days before as we were both sick with COVID, and the team were just fantastic. They waited for us to recover and then we started to talk through options again. We were able to rebook just six months after our original date, and the team were accomodating and understanding throughout the process.
The day itself was perfect. Lots of our guests commented on the quality and quantity of the food and Hugo was great at keeping everything to time. We wish we could do it all again."
V126,The Hackney,"We had our wedding reception here and wow was it amazing. Hugo, Erika and the whole team were amazing. Every single guest commented on how delicious and plentiful the food was. The staff were amazing nothing was too much to ask and all so happy.
The venue itself was decorated amazingly, given we left our wedding stationary etc up to the venue it exceeded our expectations. I was concerned about the allowed decibel level for Dj / entertainment but it was plenty loud enough. I wish I could relive the day again, if you’re thinking about booking The Hackney do it! You will not regret!"
V126,The Hackney,"We held our wedding reception at The Hackney in July and it was truly the best experience. We opted for a standing reception for our 65 guests, serving food bowl-style for a more relaxed, less formal feel. The food was absolutely delicious and there was lots of it - it just kept coming! Our guests are still raving about how good the food was months later! Lots of good drinks options too - we especially like the cocktails here!

The staff on the night were so friendly, welcoming and were amazing with our children guests too!

The Hackney is such an aesthetic venue with exposed brick walls and existing foliage which we loved, so we kept additional decorations to a minimum. We dropped our decorations to The Hackney the day before and picked them up the day after, which was super easy! We hadn’t given them too much direction with where we wanted everything placed but when we turned up to the venue on the day it was truly perfect! The staff know exactly what they’re doing and had decorated it beautifully! The outdoor seating area is a great feature too (especially for our two greyhounds who chilled out there for the majority of the reception!)

We opted for a simple Spotify playlist for our music and their sound system was good.

The wedding planning process was super easy from start to finish, with continued support and check-ins from Hugo, from the moment we booked, to the day itself! We really enjoyed the menu tasting experience earlier in the year too, which is a great touch in the build up to the big day! The planning spreadsheet was easy to use and made us feel content and relaxed, knowing that everything was under control.

Overall, we would highly recommend The Hackney to anyone looking for an affordable, dog-friendly, wedding reception venue with a laidback vibe, delicious food and lovely friendly staff! We look forward to coming back every year to celebrate our anniversary, with an espresso martini!"
V126,The Hackney,"We hosted our wedding reception with the team at the hackney in May 2023. The planning experience was straight forward and easy to book. The availability for the venue is on the website so easy to see when they have and get it booked. We went with the 5 canapés, bowl food menu, and drinks on arrival with wine through the event. The staff were brilliant and food delicious.

We loved the vibe of the venue as we wanted a bit more of a casual event, with a relaxed feel and we were able to host our 85 guests with no issues (although limited to standing event at this size, there is enough scattered seating for anyone to sit when they wanted).

In terms of decorating, we didn't feel the need to add any extra flowers as the venue was already so made up with plants and other decorations.

We did add the photo box which I highly recommend, was great fun for our friends and family and came with a memory book. People were shy at first but really got into it. We also used the recommended baker who provided a delicious cake.

Final area to mention - pricing. Wedding venues can be really expensive and daunting before you even start paying for any food or drink. Something that really attracted us to this venue was the low spacing cost and the minimum spend with it. It meant that we were able to completely customise the experience and see where the money we were spending was going. There are many different options and packages to go with, so it's up to you.

Only thing that wasn't offered was any tasting of the food beforehand which we would've liked to have done but none the less, the food was delicious so it wasn't really needed!

To finish, we loved every moment of it and hope that many others get to experience the same. Thank you very much team at the hackney!"
V126,The Hackney,"We had our reception in July. The venue was cosy and comfortably fit 30 people without feeling too crowded or too empty (we were worried it might be too empty). We managed to fit a band in, arranged mini-golf in the venue after dinner, and customize the cocktail menu with custom recipe (that we provided before hand).

One of the biggest highlights was the food. The crispy roast pork got so many complements and indeed it was tasty. But really, all the dishes were amazing (we had a tasting session prior), it was hard to choose, but the taste of each dish was still top notch on the day itself too. I heard that the supper snacks we ordered were great too but alas, I was too busy and they were snapped up instantly!

Some other details:
* We were allowed to use the small room downstairs as a private space to put our stuff. Very handy to not mess up items.
* We went with a bar tab and kept increasing the budget each time till the end of the night instead of the all-you-can-drink. From our rough calculations, it worked out about the same going for all-you-can-drink. Of course, certain folk were heavy weights and more than made it up will be different for each crowd.
* Lighting for photos came out excellent (combination of photographer and venue lighting).
* You can adjust air conditioning to suit the weather (we had ours on the warm side due to older folk not dealing with cold too well).
* Outdoor space was a pleasant change in atmosphere for those who wanted some fresh air.

What about the review from the Bride? Bride approved this review."
V126,The Hackney,"The day was fabulous - Hugo was brilliant and flexible with what we were after. The tasting day before was such a great idea and the whole experience and guidance given made planning a wedding in c.5 months so much easier. We had vegans, last minute drop outs, ridiculously hot weather, about 3 different spotify playlists, a string quartet, florists arriving in the morning and a cake that arrived the day before - the team took it all in their stride and it seemed like a breeze. Loved it all and we've had such good feedback from guests. A fabulous whirlwind.

Two very minor points for feedback - we maxed out the guest numbers (the team did advise us against it but were very accommodating despite us also throwing musicians into the mix) and it was a little too crowded pre-lunch on such a hot day. We also put some speeches in between courses (again, we were recommended against it) and that may have been a slight mistake for the dessert timings, as the tasting day was 10/10. But, it was a perfect day in a stunning venue. Loved it - thank you guys."
V126,The Hackney,"Jon and the team were absolute superstars, hosting the perfect wedding day for us. The space is beautiful, the decor is modern and perfect. They were so accommodating for any request or question we had which we really appreciated. Guests commented on how great the cocktails were! The day ran so smoothly and we had a fantastic time."
V126,The Hackney,"From the initial phonecall to the warm welcome we got when we first visited The Hackney, we knew we were in safe hands and that we’d made the perfect choice. The venue offers the most beautiful interiors - the perfect mix of cosy, intimate and modern industrial - exactly what we were looking for!

Our entire experience with The Hackney was an absolute dream -we loved the mega organised approach to planning. Something that could have been incredibly intimidating was made so straightforward with the amazing support of Hugo the General Manager who embraced all our weird and wonderful suggestions and gave expert advice on what we could do to make things even better. We left every meeting buzzing with ideas and even more excited to welcome our closest friends and family to the big day.

The quality of the food and drinks is impeccable - every single one of our guests (even the fussiest!) has commented on how much they loved it. We absolutely loved the menu tasting, even though it made the decision even harder as everything was amazing. What makes it even better for us is living close by and being able to pop into our wedding venue for a coffee or a cocktail!

I couldn't recommend The Hackney enough - I just wish we could go back and do it all again!"
V127,PYRÁ,"We held our wedding reception at Pyra. We booked the entire venue, with the upstairs loft serving as a dance floor with bar and downstairs having tables and seating for guests.  Canapes were served upstairs and a buffet dinner was served downstairs.  We lucked out with great April weather, so guests were also able to enjoy Pyra’s patio and additional space on Lonsdale Road. We were very happy with our decision to have our reception at Pyra, and many of our guests commented on how lovely the space was, how nice the staff were, and how delicious the food was.
 
The venue:
The space is gorgeous with lots of natural light upstairs.  Guests arrived at 4pm but we had the venue for the entire day, and Pyra gave our florist access earlier to set up beautiful flower arrangements and candles - it looked stunning.  Pyra set up our welcome sign and card box too. The venue also accepted delivery of our cake on the morning of the wedding which was a huge help, set it up very nicely upstairs, and cut it for us after the formal “cake cutting” shots.  We were able to coordinate with Pyra ahead of time to arrange the space how we wanted, such as how many tables we wanted downstairs and the set-up of the loft upstairs.  They even had a microphone ready for us upstairs so we could say a few words to our guests before our cake cutting. Perfect! For the evening dancing, we were able to set the disco lighting to our colour scheme, which worked really well with candles and foliage (latter 2 provided by our florist).
 
The food:
The buffet dinner was fantastic.  Pyra gave us multiple menu items to choose from and we were able to fix a nice menu that took into account guests’ dietary restrictions.  We initially booked the venue when it had a different chef and menu.  We came in a few months before our wedding to try the new menu – our dinner was delicious then and there was no dip in quality for the buffet-style served at our reception. Fionn worked with us how to plan best - because we wanted a relaxed style with a dance floor upstairs, we ended up feeding our 80 guests in two sittings downstairs, which worked perfectly. The upstairs space can seat 60 people, which didn’t work for how we planned our event, but does look really nice in photos. The late night food served around 10pm also went down very well.
 
The staff:
The staff, including the bartenders and waiters, were hardworking, friendly and very nice to guests.  Enough staff were around that guests never had to wait long for drinks.  Members of staff cut our cake for us and also boxed up the late night food for guests to bring home.  Fionn, the day-of coordinator, was on-site for our entire reception and was very helpful, even helping coordinate our midnight bus arrival.
 
Responsiveness:
Overall we were happy with the responsiveness of the venue.  It took a little while to nail down the final details of the food menu and drinks menu/bar tab but we were ultimately very happy with the result.  As the venue hosts more weddings/ larger-scale events we’d expect this will improve.

Overall:
We highly recommend Pyra for a wedding reception. We had 80 guests in total, which worked very well for the canapes/cocktail hour upstairs (4-6pm), sit-down buffet downstairs (6-8pm, split into two seatings) and dancing upstairs (8pm-midnight).  The upstairs loft was able to fit all 80 guests plus a four-piece band.  Lonsdale Road is also a charming street that provided great photo opportunities.  We looked into several other venues, and came away happy with Pyra's quote – we were able to book the venue, food (including canapes, dinner and late night food) and a generous bar tab for roughly the amount some other London venues were charging for just their space (no food or drink included). We and our guests had a fantastic time. Thanks so much to Fionn and the Pyra team :)"
V127,PYRÁ,"We had our wedding celebration at Lula. We booked the loft and restaurant for this.

Positives:
The venue is beautiful and needs minimal decoration.
The food was amazing; the chef is truly professional and everyone loved it.
They redecorated the restaurant section and added a set of couches to make it a lounge, which was beautiful.
The staff was very hardworking, professional, and lovely.

They provided us with a lounge, a wedding breakfast space and a dance floor.

Flexibility with Cake:
The bakery was scheduled to deliver and set up the cake at 16:45, but they delivered it at 09:45 instead. The Lula team handled the situation professionally by storing the cake and setting it up at the correct time. They presented the cake beautifully and assisted in cutting it into nice pieces. It could not have been more perfect.


The list of available drinks was huge, and they were happy to make custom drinks and bring in different juices if requested in advance. The event manager tried to accommodate every wish we had, and on the day we could not have hoped for more. Most of our guests said it was one of the best weddings and most beautiful venues they had ever been to.

Negatives:
Food tasting for the wedding menu was not included, which we had assumed would be, but it was given at a 50% discount. We had to sort out the floral decoration last minute, as they had initially suggested they would arrange it for us after providing a budget, but later said we needed to find our own. At times, they were a bit slow to respond, which made us anxious, but after communicating with them, this was resolved, and communication was very swift.

In conclusion:
Lula gave us the most beautiful wedding we could have dreamt of. We highly recommend them. The venue, the food, the service were amazing, and we could not have hoped for more."
V128,Sandon Manor,"We had such a special wedding at Sandon Manor, the team made every effort to make our day so so special and we will be forever grateful for that. A dream team! The day ran so smoothly and they worked so hard. The venue is unique with lots of different spaces which unfold throughout the day, which was perfect as our wedding fell on a wet and windy autumnal day. We would highly recommend Sandon Manor!"
V128,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor provided the perfect venue for our wedding. From the initial conversations and meetings with the team, we knew we were in safe hands and had made the right choice. They kept us informed with any events, made information a bit payments clear and reassured us with any query we had.
The accommodation was exceptional and fitted our requirements perfectly, with high quality finishing touches throughout to ensure our stay was as comfortable as possible.
The wedding venue was incredible! Our ceremony took place in the gorgeously modern barn with stunning draping and greenery. Following on, we had a blissful drinks reception which was on the expertly manicured lawn (with mini golf!) and sun-trap of a courtyard. We then moved onto our wedding breakfast which was held in the main barn, seating all of our guests comfortably with space for decor and extra details. Following from dinner, the part started and the club room came to life! This was absolutely the talking point of the day and our guests raved about how incredible it was! It managed to create a club-like atmosphere, whilst maintaining the vibe, albeit at a reduced volume, in the rest of the barn. The layout of the venue was important to us, as it ensured our guests never strayed too far, to keep the momentum of the day.
The team at Sandon worked superbly with all of vendors which ensured the day ran smoothly from set up to clearing. All of our vendors commented on how much they too loved working there.
The venue, the aesthetics, the staff, everything was perfect! We would absolutely recommend to anyone getting married."
V128,Sandon Manor,"We cannot recommend Sandon Manor enough. From the quality of the service, the helpfulness and friendliness of the team, the beautiful accommodation and the most amazing venue which all or guests loved partying the night away in. To make it even more special the Manor is in amazing grounds in beautiful countryside and nature reserves.
Sandon Manor made our dream come true."
V128,Sandon Manor,"I couldn't recommend Sandon Manor highly enough - from our first enquiry to our Wedding, nothing was too much trouble. The team are so friendly and easy to communicate with, very approachable and responsive. They respond to any questions immediately and having the day before to set up with Tom was fantastic. Styaying in the Manor House and Dovecote was the icing on the cake as to be with friends and family the night before and the day after was so fabulous. On the day Tom and the team were absolutely fantastic and couldn't have done more to make our special day. We couldn't have dreamt of anywhere more perfect than Sandon Manor - a huge thank you to all the staff."
V128,Sandon Manor,"If you are considering Sandon Manor for your wedding venue, I beg you: scratch it off your list now. Yes, the house and grounds are beautiful, but the people behind it are absolutely awful. They ruined our wedding experience.

I will get straight to it. Sandon Manor has a very strict policy on guests leaving the site by 11:30pm (and no one is allowed back to the Manor unless they’re official guests staying overnight). We had lots of international guests at our wedding. Many hadn’t seen each other in years and would be jetlagged - we thought they may be keen to continue chatting after 11:30pm. With this in mind, we made a booking with Sandon Village Hall via our contacts at the church (where we were attending services and later married). They granted us access to the village hall until 1am as a contingency spill over space.

We mentioned this in passing during our online meeting with one of the Sandon Manor team a month before our wedding. Within hours, I received a voicemail from the lady in charge of Village Hall bookings saying (quote) “someone at Sandon Manor is trying to throw a spanner into the works for you”. It soon transpired that they had raised an official complaint to the parish council and pressurised the village hall team into cancelling our booking. To be clear, Sandon village Hall and Sandon Manor are entirely separate entities – there is no crossover between them whatsoever, as the owner of Sandon Manor later acknowledged.

It gets worse. Gob smacked, we asked Kate – the owner of Sandon Manor – for a call to find out what was going on. She was abhorrent, trying to justify her meddling as a necessary measure to protect her wedding license (side note: with Sandon Manor it is always about the money – once your deposit is paid they care nothing for your ‘special day’; you are just another cash cow). Did she apologise for stabbing us, her clients, in the back? No, she did not. She could not even fathom how hurt we were by being completely bypassed in the communication chain and how deceitful and disrespectful this was. My husband and I were quite literally left speechless. We’ve never experienced this sort of treatment from anyone, let alone our wedding venue - to whom we were paying many thousands of pounds. Dealing with this stress in the final month of wedding prep really took its toll on us and soured things. We no longer looked forward to our day, rather dreaded what Sandon Manor might do next.

Aside from this major incident, there were many other occasions when Sandon Manor were unhelpful and unfeeling in their interactions with us:

- We enquired if it would be possible to arrange a large pizza takeaway order instead of using Sandon Manor’s caterer for our late night food. One of the team explained on a call that this wasn’t contractually possible; we acknowledged this. We then received an email saying ‘If you are unable to follow this or any other of our T&C's we would be happy to cancel your booking.’ This was less than a month before our wedding.
- We had a harpist perform in the church. We were told she wasn’t allowed to play during our drinks reception in the grounds due to potential noise complaints (an acoustic harp at 2pm in the afternoon). No other music was permitted outside the house.
- Sandon Manor is an incredibly expensive (in hindsight, grossly overpriced) venue. But we were also hit with hidden fees when booking their accommodation option - an extra £425 ‘cleaning fee’ was added to our bill.
- At the time of booking, Sandon was running a promotion waivering the £700 fee for hiring their ceremony space. As we were marrying at the church, we asked if it would please be possible to put this towards other elements of our day i.e. using their festoon string of lights in the barn (for which they charge £450). They refused.
- We were unsure about booking the 1-bed Dovecote on the grounds as - at £499 for the weekend - it was a considerable expense. While we were deciding Sandon Manor rented it out on Air BnB (to one of our guests, which made for a very awkward conversation).

To summarise, you only get one wedding day. Kate and her team absolutely ruined ours. There are so many other lovely venues in north Hertfordshire run by decent, humane people. Please prioritise your happiness and choose wisely. I wish we had."
V128,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor is a stunning wedding venue with a great team behind it. The exclusive use of the manor for the weekend was a highlight, allowing us to relax with friends and family in the lead up to and after the big day. The Sandon team were brilliant, guiding us through the planning process and ensuring everything ran smoothly on the day. We couldn't have asked for a better place and team to help us celebrate our big day."
V128,Sandon Manor,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our special day. Holly, Tom and the rest of the brilliant team made us feel welcome from day one. Special mention to Tom for making the day run so seamlessly, so professional and accommodating of all our needs.

The venue itself is stunning, located in the beautiful Hertfordshire countryside. The Manor House makes for a tremendous location to prepare, and the Dovecote suite is a nice touch: a great addition for the groom to spend the last night. We loved the small details of the characteristic main venue, with the botanical feel to the bar a great backdrop to the barn.

It’s a shame we can’t stay every week!

Dan & Suzanne"
V128,Sandon Manor,"To Holly, Louise, Tom & Kate, wow, what can we say but the biggest thank you for the best day of our lives! When we viewed the beautiful venue over two years ago we just knew instantly Sandon Manor was the one, not just because it’s stunning, but you guys are amazing! Thank you for making all our wedding dreams come true. Forever grateful and can’t wait to return to reminisce. Lots of love, the new Mr & Mrs Jakes xxx"
V128,Sandon Manor,"From the moment we visited Sandon Manor we knew this would be our wedding venue for 9 September 2023. Seeing the spectacular finish of the house carry through to the completed venue just shows the high level of attention to detail this venue had to offer.

Holly, Tom and the rest of the team filled us with confidence right from our first interactions, annd went above and beyond on the wedding weekend itself to facilitate us, our suppliers and guests. The main house, dovecote, annex and extensive grounds were a wonderful way to have close family stay with us on site, and so handy to be able to all get ready nearby the morning of.

Thank you for making our wedding weekend a truly memorable occasion, for us and our families. We all look back on this day with the happiest, sunniest memories and Sandon Manor will always have a very special place in our hearts."
V128,Sandon Manor,"We had the most amazing wedding weekend at Sandon Manor.

The venue itself is the perfect backdrop for a wedding, our photos looked amazing from every single angle. There were so many spaces to make use of throughout the day which helped things to run incredibly smoothly and meant we didn’t need to have a ‘turnaround’ during the evening. The spaces really wowed our guests and created such a lovely atmosphere. Including the ‘club room’ dance floor that had our guests dancing until the very last song!

We stayed at the Manor House for the weekend, extending our wedding into a perfect weekend retreat. The house itself is beautiful, with lots of different areas for everyone to relax, and the perfect peaceful location to chill the night before the big day!

From our first viewing to checking out the day after our wedding, the Sandon staff were attentive, friendly and helped us feel relaxed and looked after throughout an otherwise overwhelming process. We’d highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for a beautiful, peaceful and unique wedding venue!"
V129,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Thank you so much to the entire team for making our wedding so special! Thanks to Donique, MJ, Mo, Harry and everyone else for helping us organise our day and for their professional but friendly attitude. Merchant Taylors is such a beautiful venue and offers a brilliant layout and different spaces to make the day so special!"
V129,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you all so very much for such an amazing wedding on Saturday. You all worked tirelessly to make it so special. Everything was truly wonderful and you all did me proud! Both Hugh and I couldn’t have asked for anything more in terms of being so well looked after. Our guests were so impressed and have given us so many compliments on a brilliantly well run event. Thank you all again for playing a brilliant part in our truly wonderful day of which we loved every minute
V129,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you so much for the most wonderful wedding reception at the end of April. We had the perfect day and our guests all commented on how well looked after they has been. Thank you again for all your hard work!
V129,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"We know this is very late (we have no excuse), but we wanted to say thank you for everything you and the team at Merchant Taylor's did for us on our wedding day. All the guests have since told us how much they loved the venue, food and service. Fingers crossed you get a few couples getting in touch! Again, Thank You for everything!"
V129,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"My brother and I attended the wedding today, as Florist's for the wedding party.
We were treated fantastically well by ALL the staff that we met, nothing was too much trouble and they made our task a COMPLETE pleasure.
If this is how they treat the actual wedding party then you will have a unforgettable time. Many thanks to all the staff for helping us to do our job with ease ."
V129,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Zara,

Can we thank you and your team at Merchant Taylor’s Hall for all your hard work in making Caroline and Neil’s recent wedding so very special. You, in particular, were able to deal with every question and request in a really professional manner.

Merchant Taylors’ Hall is part of the rich panoply of history and tradition, which makes this great City. All of our guests, and in particular those from abroad, were totally spell bound by the atmosphere, the food and service.

James was superb in organising the whole operation. To turn the Great Hall from a wedding ceremony hall to a banqueting suite for 110 guests, including flowers, place settings and dance floor in ninety minutes was truly remarkable.

The food and wine was of an amazing standard, we know that Merchant Taylors’ Hall has a reputation for presenting some of the finest dining in the City of London. You certainly surpassed all expectations.

We have many wonderful memories of the 10th September 2016, but it is best summed up by our daughter Caroline, “Can we do it all over again?”."
V130,Garden Museum,I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate everything that you did to make our party such a success last Friday. It was brilliant being outside on such a lovely everning. Everyone was very impressed with the venue.
V130,Garden Museum,"Thank you for all your help, advice and on-the-day support, it really made our wedding very special and it certianly went off without a hitch! The Museum looked amazing and the garden was perfect, especially as the sunshine adn the guests wanted to make the most of the beautiful surroundings."
V131,Clearwell Castle,"Can’t tell you how wonderful the team were at Clearwell. Our wedding coordinator Phaedra was exceptional. Attention to detail and everyone of the team from front of house, waiting staff, groundsmen and the DJ made our day absolutely everything we dreamed of and unique to us.

Can’t recommend highly enough and cost was outstanding value for money.

So many our guest commented on the quality of the food and that it was the best wedding they had been too! The children loved the magic of the castle and opportunity to get outside and see the grounds.

The grooms family had a fabulous time staying in the cottages the night before and our guests at both the Castle & the Wyndham had a fabulous stay on the night of the wedding.

Wish we could do it all again!"
V131,Clearwell Castle,We had our wedding at Clearwell in June and we couldn’t recommend it highly enough. From start to finish everything was perfect and they went above and beyond to ensure we had an amazing day. I’d not hesitate in recommending them to any couples. Just a gorgeous place with staff that really care in making your day all that you hope it will be.
V131,Clearwell Castle,"From the moment we first visited Clearwell, we knew this was the venue for us. From the moment we started planning to the final touches on the day, all the staff were fantastic. Ann, our wedding coordinator, was a delight to work with throughout. Nothing was too much trouble and she kept us updated throughout. The day was tailored exactly to our needs and when we arrived at the venue on the day they had prepared everything perfectly.

We did the night before package which included rooms and food the evening before. We were supplied with so much food no one went hungry. The rooms in the Wyndham and the Castle are fantastically appointed.

The venue itself is gorgeous. The cellar bar downstairs adds a whole different dimension to the occasion where you can really let your hair down.

This was an absolute dream come true venue for us. We loved every single minute."
V131,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot fault this venue at all. We initially had to change our wedding date because of lockdown and they were so supportive and empathetic.
Ann, our coordinator, is quite possibly the loveliest person on the planet. She was always happy to answer any questions and it never felt like we were being a nuisances or asking a silly question.
On the morning of the wedding she was a lovely calm presence and the whole day just ran like clockwork.
The food was out of this world with many guests saying it was the best food they’d had at a wedding and one person actually thought we’d hired a Michellin Chef!
The venue is so so beautiful with plenty of space. The downstairs cellar was a great place to party the night away, it was like an exclusive nightclub. There were lots of quieter rooms for people who wanted some peace.
The DJ was brilliant, we forgot to give a list of songs we liked but he did a great job of guessing what we liked ( he must’ve looked at our age and figured nineties dance music was our era. And he was bang on the money)
I do not have a single complaint about this venue"
V131,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot speak highly enough about Clearwell Castle as a wedding venue. The venue itself is absolutely stunning. It rained on our wedding day but the indoor space was so vast and beautiful that ourselves and our guests still had the most amazing time! Our wedding co-ordinator, Phaedra, was absolutely incredible, both before and during the wedding. She was always so professional, replied to all of my emails (there were many) and answered all queries efficiently. On the day, we genuinely could not have managed without her. The day flowed so well with her guidance and it really helped me as the Bride as I felt I didn't need to worry about anything! All the other staff at Clearwell and at the Wyndham hotel were also so wonderful! Everyone worked so hard and every member of staff was so kind to us; it just made our day incredibly special and we are so appreciative to them all. The food was great, service very quick and all the guests really enjoyed it! We had so many compliments about the staff and venue! I honestly could not recommend Clearwell castle more as a wedding venue!"
V131,Clearwell Castle,"Our wedding on 10/11/23 was just the absolute perfect day from start to finish. Our wedding planner manager, Hannah, was incredible, not just on the day but throughout the whole planning process. She ensured everything ran smoothly on the day, sparing no details ensuring everything was just perfect and to time but without being stressful. She was very accommodating with the planning meetings working around both mine and my now Husband's shift patterns.
We both stayed the night before our wedding and the night of the wedding with many of our guests travelling a distance so also staying in the Wyndham which was very convenient. Staying in Keepers cottage with the Bridesmaids the night before added to the experience with the added feature of the hot tub, the groomsmen were very jealous. The beds were very comfortable and everyone was excited to stay in a castle.
On the day of the wedding, the staff were very accommodating moving the bridal party along to the bridal suite to finish preparations earlier than originally planned. The breakfast provided was the perfect amount for a busy morning getting ready. Everything, including the gardens, were immaculately kept adding to the WOW factor of getting married in a Castle.
The canapes served and welcome drinks were well received by the guests and ourselves whilst we had photographers prior to the wedding breakfast. The food was phenomenal and great portions and I was stuffed after. The staff were very accommodating for us with a lot of people with allergies, dislikes of mushrooms so adapting the menu for these individual people. We were even able to swap out a few bottles of wine included in our package for cocktails as us as the Bride and Groom did not drink wine.
As soon as we walked in the venue the first time, we knew it was the place we wanted to get married. Everytime we went back to view the venue again I fell more and more in love. For anyone thinking about viewing or even booking this incredible venue I would say do it! We will be going back for events in the future to relive the best day of our lives."
V131,Clearwell Castle,"We got married at Clearwell castle April 2023. What can I say it's the most perfect venue and we had the most amazing day. The organisation was amazing and the staff were great on the day and even leading up to the big day. Phaedra was our wedding planner and communication with her was great throughout and on our wedding day she ensured that it all ran smoothly. I cannot recommend Clearwell castle and their staff enough. Thank you again for helping us have our dream wedding.
Kind regards

Vanessa & David x"
V131,Clearwell Castle,"We had the most amazing wedding day on the 24th of November 2023, the whole day ran so smoothly and all our guests absolutely loved the venue. The food was amazing and our guests loved the fish and chip buffet in the evening! The whole progress of planning the wedding was so straight forward and Phedera was a great wedding manager."
V131,Clearwell Castle,"Clearwell Castle exceeded all our expectations for our wedding day. The moment we stepped onto the grounds, we were captivated by its timeless charm. The staff, especially Hannah, went above and beyond to make every detail perfect, ensuring a seamless and stress-free experience. The Ball Room, where we exchanged our vows, felt like something out of a storybook. The surrounding gardens provided a stunning backdrop for photos and added to the overall enchantment of the day. Our guests were equally impressed, and many commented on the unique and romantic atmosphere. Choosing Clearwell Castle was the best decision we made for our special day; it truly felt like a fairy-tale come to life."
V131,Clearwell Castle,"We had the perfect wedding at Clearwell Castle, their team were superb in providing planning assistance from the point of our booking, guidance on all aspects of our wedding choices from registrars and suppliers, and coordination on the day of the wedding to make sure it flowed seamlessly. It was a beautiful day, and we couldn't be happier with our choice of Wedding location."
V132,Inner Temple,We got married here in 2023. Everything was perfect and the team made sure the day/food etc was just as we wanted it. Particular thanks to Priya and Eva (Pegasus) for their hard work making our wedding day and lead up so special.
V133,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"I got married at Dodford Manor in February this year. A great time was had by all and I will be recommending the venue to any friends planning weddings.

The weather was bad on the day so we didn’t get to use the outside area very much, but it didn’t matter as the inside is so lovely.

Sky was really helpful and put me at ease on the day. Questions in the lead up and on the day were answered quickly and I was made to feel like the only bride in the world!"
V133,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford was the first venue we looked at shortly after we got engaged. The staff were friendly and relaxed when we had a tour, I knew it was the place for us! I think Lydia telling my now husband that we couldn’t have fireworks due to the animals nearby but we could have a fire performer outside, sold the deal for us! I got an amazing fire performer as a surprise for my husband and the guests after we had sparklers, and it just completed an amazing day!
We heard such positive things Dodford about how professional and smooth running weddings have been from our suppliers, and you guys didn’t disappoint. You handled the day so well, we didn’t worry about a thing and just enjoyed ourselves the whole day.
We honestly had so many lovely messages and conversations after our wedding about how the venue was amazing, everything and everyone was catered for, from my 88 year old Nan, to young children who could play and enjoy the outdoors with a scoop of amazing ice cream. We honestly couldn’t have asked for a better day, we would do it again in a heartbeat if we could! Thank you for making the day so seamless! We are eternally grateful to everyone at Dodford for making our dreams come true becoming Mr and Mrs Price!"
V133,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford Manor what an incredible venue, from initial enquiry to booking, Dodford and the staff were so accommodating and well organised. Nothing was ever too much trouble, even if emails were being sent at 11pm. The day itself, wow it was absolutely incredible, as our wedding was on a budget and due to small numbers Dodford were amazing at setting out our decorations, everything was absolutely perfect and a special shout out to Kayleigh who was amazing on our wedding day. She kept us on time, always checking we were okay and just such a lovely person and really made our day perfect. Would highly recommend a Dodford to any couple due to be married they make the planning and the day an absolute dream and we want to relive it over again."
V133,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"It goes without saying that Dodford is a fab venue.... stunning set up, well maintained, clean, perfect grounds etc... but the best thing about Dodford is the team! I had super high expectations of any wedding venue I booked as I used to run a wedding venue myself (potential nightmare client 😂).... from the 1st viewing the team were fantastic. Relaxed, stress free, organised, professional, knowledgeable, flexible but mostly importantly friendly which gave me complete confidence in them delivering my perfect day.
In the run up to the big day the team are super responsive on email and phone We didn't meet our Event Manager, Lydia, until the day but I was always confident that they work as a whole team and therefore having 1 point of contact was not necessary at all.
In the day Lydia was amazing! Still relaxed and professional and the whole day ran so smoothly. Every requirement was perfect, on time, delivered exceptionally.
We had the best day, thank you to the whole team (especially Lydia!)
Vic & Tony

V133,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We honestly can’t say thank you enough for how amazing Dodford Manor Barn was, along with all the incredible staff who helped make our day truly unforgettable.

From the moment we visited, we fell in love with the beautiful landscapes, open-plan barns, and stunning large windows that flooded the space with natural light. The venue package was one of the best we saw during our search—it felt like everything we could possibly need was covered.

The team at Dodford Manor Barn were incredibly friendly and supportive throughout the entire planning process. Communication was open and consistent, which made everything feel so much more manageable and stress-free. We were even able to find all of our wonderful vendors through Dodford Manor Barn, which was a huge bonus!

As a bride who suffers from anxiety, I was unwell on the morning of the wedding. But I have to give special thanks to Kayleigh and our vendors, who were absolutely amazing and supported me through every step—they helped me feel calm, cared for, and ready to enjoy the day.

Our guests couldn’t stop talking about how stunning the venue was and how lovely the food turned out. We were also lucky enough to have sunshine all day, topped off with a beautiful sunset in the evening—it truly felt magical.

Thank you again, Dodford Manor Barn, for being such a perfect place to start our next chapter.

With love,
Carter & Emmie (24.03.2025) x"
V133,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"From the moment we booked our wedding at Dodford Manor, we knew we were in good hands—but nothing could have prepared us for just how extraordinary the experience would be. Every single detail was handled with such precision, care, and genuine warmth that it truly felt like a dream come to life.

The venue itself is breathtaking, but what made our day unforgettable was the impeccable service. The entire team operated like a well-oiled machine, making sure everything ran smoothly while keeping the atmosphere joyful and stress-free. Their attention to detail was second to none—no request was too big or too small.

We want to give a heartfelt, special shoutout to *Lydia*, our incredible Wedding Manager. From our first meeting to the final dance, she was nothing short of amazing. Lydia went above and beyond at every turn—anticipating needs before we even voiced them, coordinating flawlessly with suppliers, and offering support with a calming confidence that put us completely at ease, (apart from making me cry the second I saw her! 😂). Her passion for what she does shone through in every interaction, and our day would not have been the same without her.

Thanks to this amazing venue and its phenomenal team (especially Lydia!), we were able to truly enjoy every moment of our wedding, knowing everything was in the best possible hands. If you're considering this venue for your big day—don’t hesitate. It’s everything you hope for, and more.

We want to do it over and over!
A day we will NEVER forget!!

Thank you again and all our Love,
Mr & Mr Pargeter-Prince

V133,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We booked Dodford Manor in Feb 2024 after we viewed the space, for our wedding in March 2025. It was the only venue we viewed, but instantly fell in love with the character and variety of spaces the venue had to offer. The free corkage also really appealed to us as a great way for us to bring our own drinks at a good cost.

From start to end, the team were amazing, helping us with the planning of the day and making sure we had a great array of suppliers we could work with. The live band was a huge part of our day, and Dodford have a great mixture of acts on their supplier list.

On the day of the wedding, the groomsmen arrived at the venue to help with set up to see that our amazing event manager, Kayleigh had every single aspect of the day in hand and sorted. She sorted all table settings, decor, stationary - Everything!! Nothing was too much to ask of her and the Dodford team. The day ran impeccably well, with everything being on time and everything we asked for being sorted. Our drinks were served chilled, on time and were always around. It’s easy for venues who offer free corkage to try and limit you drinking your own drink - Not here!! There was constantly beers being topped up, wine bottles replaced and aperol spritz being taken round. Cannot fault them!

The team packed all of our bits away and ready for us to collect the next morning. We are very aware Dodford is a busy venue and wanted to make sure we wasn’t just “another wedding” but at no point was that the case. We felt like we were the one and only wedding and genuinely could not ask for more!

Thank you so so much for everything, Highly recommended!!"
V133,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We got married her a month ago today and had the most amazing day with them. Jess, Jack and the team made sure that everything ran smoothly and that they were doing everything they could for us on the day. We would 100% recommend them for anyone wishing to marry in such a beautiful setting."
V133,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We had been apprehensive booking Dodford for our reception that it was so popular in Northamptonshire that our wedding could end up looking the same as a lot of others we knew of, as we're local - but that was a ridiculous thing to worry about! The level of flexibility/customisation you get with Dodford is unmatched in our opinion; as it's such a beautiful venue to start with, you don't have to work hard to make it look good before adding in your personality as a couple!

The whole process from enquiries to final planning and the execution on the day were great. We did have a slight issue with them not inviting us to a food tasting in enough time before our wedding date (whether they forgot/we were missed off a list we don't know) but when we did raise it they invited us to a tasting at their sister venue instead (it's 2 hours away but we were available to travel thankfully). Every member of staff we encountered in our experience with Dodford were so friendly and make you feel like you are the only couple that matters for them in that moment, which we really appreciated from such a popular/busy venue. Abbie was our Event Manager on the day and provided such an elevated level of service, nothing was too much trouble and she executed our plans/vision to a tee, adding in some extra details that we loved too.

Our wedding was in December 2024, and we only had our reception at Dodford, so the ceremony barn was set up for our drinks reception with plenty of space for guests without it feeling cramped or equally like we were all rattling around in there (we had 75 guests for our reception). They don't have many photos of indoor drinks receptions in their promo so I was a little worried how it would look but the team had it set up beautifully. We also had a brass band on the mezzanine level which was really fun and festive!

What sold Dodford for us was the no daytime corkage, which meant we could really personalise our drinks reception and wedding breakfast drinks without breaking the bank. There was a slight disconnect with how and when we had requested/planned to serve some of the drinks in our planning meeting and what happened on the day, which we think may have been a slight hiccup in communication between Dodford and Jenkinsons (the caterers), but it didn't have a negative impact on our day at all!

Overall, there's a reason this is such a popular venue - it is truly perfect!"
V133,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,Dodford manor is an amazing wedding venue. From the very beginning when we first stepped into the venue to look around we fell in love. We knew we had to have our wedding there. After booking the venue we had amazing contact with the staff from booking our food tasting session. To a general email to see how our wedding planning was going. The planning meeting was well organised and we were able to talk through exactly what we wanted and no want was too big for the team.
V134,Gosfield Hall,"I never imagined my wedding would be somewhere as stunning as Gosfield hall but from the minute we saw this venue we knew it was the one for us and didn't bother viewing anymore venues as we had already made our minds up about having our wedding here! We were absolutely blown away with the natural beauty of Gosfield hall and so booked two years in advance of our wedding day! The professionalism and advice we received from Linda was super helpful and informative on the run up to our wedding as there is soo much to think about! We loved that we could have our day and evening all in one place aswell as the option weather permitting to have our wedding ceremony outside. I'm pleased to say the weather was absolutely perfect on our wedding day and we got to have our fairytale wedding outside! The package we paid for was well worth the money! Our guests were absolutely spoilt on our day and have all said it was the best wedding they've ever been too! It was amazing to have our guests stay over aswell! Jocie our wedding planner was absolutely amazing! She was sooo friendly and super accommodating and went above and beyond on our day to make it absolutely perfect with no hiccups! She even helped dress me on the day as she knew how to do up a corset dress and my mother didn't have a clue lol she made all my wedding details and decorations come to life and done such a stunning job decorating our dream venue aswell as being super supportive towards me my family and guests! The honeymoon suite is the best we've ever seen and completely took ours and our guests breaths away! Mind blowing! The food,venue,grounds,accomodation and night before accomodation were absolutely stunning and we want to thank everyone at Gosfield hall for making our day soo incredible and special and a day we and our guests will never forget! We can't wait to return to Gosfield! Thank you everyone at Gosfield what an amazing place!"
V134,Gosfield Hall,"We had previously experienced Gosfield Hall as a guest before deciding on it for our anniversary.

Our day was beautiful and went according to plan. Our guests all had great feedback about the day.

The only thing we would have changed would have been more diverse menu for the main meals."
V134,Gosfield Hall,"Gosfield hall is a beautiful location for a wedding and their packages cover all the important stuff! We didn’t have to worry about caterers, wedding coordinator or a DJ - all included! Great service, lovely food and everyone really enjoyed the day! Our coordinator Jocie was fab on the day, getting everything organised and fetching anything we needed. Couldn’t have asked for better, she knew the time line and the day flowed really smoothly!"
V134,Gosfield Hall,"We got married at Gosfield Hall and everything about it was perfect from when we arrive to view it, booking, the communication and Faye Carter our wedding Coordinator! If you want the best wedding day with no hassle, Gosfield is your place!!"
V134,Gosfield Hall,"Myself and my Wife have just got married at Gosfield Hall,
Our expensive started when we viewed the venue and we first met Linda sales manager, she welcome us in & made us feel at home, we wasn’t sure how, but she made us feel calm like this was where we was meant to be.
Once we looked around at all the venue has to offer we had already made a decision as this is such a stunning location and instantly new this was what we wanted! It was just right for us.

We did not get made to feel pressured to make any decisions immediately however we did end up booking our big say within the next few days after our visit.

Our next contact was with Ellie our wedding planner, she was very helpful and nothing was ever to much, we enjoyed the food tasting at the venue and was very impressed with the experience, it was out of this world.
Ellie helped us through all of our problems and made sure all of our plans come to life.

Now on our big day, what can I say? The staff were amazing, Ellie couldn’t have done enough every time you wanted to ask a question she was next to us any time we needed something. She was there all the way through the day/ night & even the next morning, Ellie made our day Run seamlessly.
We’ve been to many weddings before but never have we had food as amazing as we did here.
Every guest was amazed at the food quality and commented on how delicious it was!
Just to sum up if you’re thinking about booking your wedding at Gosfield Hall don’t question it just book it. You will be amazed."
V134,Gosfield Hall,"The venue is stunning and was the perfect setting for our winter wedding (so much natural light even in January). Jocie Golbourn was our assigned wedding planning specialist and she is so kind, sweet, patient and professional. All our guests loved the venue but many actually commented on how flawless and seamless the day was organised and rooms decorated and prepared from each section of the wedding and we only have Jocie and venue staff to thank for their meticulous planning and preparations. The food and drinks were delicious. Couldn’t recommend this venue enough- we actually booked the venue on a whim and were SO happy when we visited for an open day. There’s no false advertisements- it’s stunning."
V134,Gosfield Hall,"Everything, from start to finish, was exactly what we wanted and more. The preparation was helped by our wonderful personal manager, Tara, and accommodated each and every one of our requests and needs. The venue is gorgeous, food delicious, and atmosphere felt special. Our friends and family all told us that this was such a spectacular wedding for them that it was the best they've ever been to. We felt completely taken care of, kept us calm and happy throughout the day, and kept all of our suppliers in place and to standard. It felt glamourous and unique. We wish we could relive the day over and over. It really was our dream wedding."
V134,Gosfield Hall,"We got married in Gosfield Hall in May and had the most amazing wedding day that any couple could ask for. The whole experience from the arrival the night before to leaving the day after was seamlessly managed by the team at the venue.
The house and the grounds looked absolutely stunning and Ellie and the team did a brilliant job at keeping the day running smoothly without making anyone feel rushed. Everyone there was immensely friendly and helpful and we really felt that everyone who worked there was invested in making our day feel special.
We fell in love with the venue when we booked it but the whole experience exceeded out expectations so much that we wish we could do it all again!"
V134,Gosfield Hall,"I wanted to take a moment to commend and state our appreciation for Jocie. She truly was phenomenal, approachable and no task was too big.
We had 5 months to plan our wedding and we loved every moment. With us both working in the service industry it was great to have someone who was so switched on and would be an asset to have on any team."
V134,Gosfield Hall,"Having just got married at Gosfield Hall I can honestly say it was the most beautiful venue and the most perfect day. The staff were so attentive and professional. The food was outstanding and the drinks and cocktails were fabulous. They couldn’t do enough to make sure our day was everything we’d dreamt of. I have to say a special thanks to Ellie - one of the wedding coordinators on site - she went above and beyond to help us plan our day and was there from the very moment I woke up delivering fresh pastries for breakfast to the moment she made me a cup of tea to go to bed with. I can’t thank you enough Ellie, you are an absolute credit to Gosfield Hall."
V135,Kingston Estate Totnes,"When I first enquired with Kingston I thought it would be too expensive but we explained what are budget was and when we wanted to get married and they put a quote together that was affordable.
We have just had the most amazing one day wedding which didn't finish until the early hours. We got married in the Long Barn where there are chandeliers running down the middle, it was very romantic. There is this nightclub at Kingston which is very cool which everyone loved. The guests all said the venue was stunning and the food was out of this world.
A few of us stayed the night before and most of our guests stayed the night of the wedding in the cottages and barns. The staff were brilliant and they coordinated the whole day for us. I cant recommend the venue enough."
V135,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had a two day wedding at the Kingston Estate. All our guests were completely blown away by it.
Most of our friends and family had traveled far for the weekend and were not disappointed when then arrived as the cottages and barns are gorgeous. Some even have hot tubs.
Jodie and the Weddings Team organised a welcome party for the first night which was unreal along with providing street style food for everyone around 8.30 pm. At Kingston they have this really cool enormous Yurt and food hut which is used the day before the wedding and for breakfast.
On the wedding day itself we got married in the Walled Garden and there were endless canapes during the drinks reception. We then decided to eat in the Hayloft Barn which has glass windows overlooking all the gardens.
We used the clear span marquee for our reception party and had the craziest cover band before we all went into the nightclub until 3 am. The good thing about Kingston is everything is included they let you use things like cake stands, easels, knifes, speakers, microphones, all furniture at no extra cost, they set everything up for you and then clean up afterwards. We didn]t have to do anything which made everything totally stress free.

Thank you Jodie, Ellie and Charlotte it was insane !!"
V135,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had the most magical wedding at Kingston. From the moment we set foot onto the grounds, we knew it was the perfect place for our special day. It was our first viewing… and nothing else compared for us (we saw a total of 6 venues). What stood out to us the most was the variety of spaces available for each part of the day. The selection of ceremony areas, the beautiful outdoor spots for photos, the yurt for the night before party, and a special one for us… the underground nightclub for the evening! As party lovers, this was a part that sold it for us; there was somewhere for every moment.

One of the things we loved most was the flexibility to personalize every aspect of our wedding. The venue truly felt like a blank canvas that we could transform into our dream setting, but equally, we got away with doing absolutely nothing as it was beautiful all on its own.

But what truly made our experience unforgettable was the incredible staff, led by Jodie. They were not only professional and attentive but also genuinely warm and welcoming. Their support and attention to detail ensured that everything ran smoothly, allowing us to relax and fully enjoy our day.

We're hoping to return and stay in the future, for a special occasion.

It's not just a wedding venue; it's a place that holds a special spot in our hearts as the backdrop to the beginning of our happily ever after 🤍"
V135,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Kingston was perfect. Despite a rainy start, the day was amazing and Jodie was available but subtly in the background allowing the day to be ours."
V135,Kingston Estate Totnes,"After over a two and a half year wait due to Covid, our son and his wife had a wonderful wedding weekend. Jodie from Kingston Estate and her team of staff went above and beyond to ensure the wedding ran smoothly. Every detail was dealt with professionally. The accommodation, venue and food were all excellent and all our guests many from overseas had a wonderful time. The only thing Jodie could not oversee was the weather but even a little rain didn't spoil the celebrations."
V135,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue and staff were brilliant from start to finish. The venue is really multi-functional and caters for rain or shine. The weather was really unpredictable around the time of our wedding but I was a stress free bride knowing they had it in hand. The food supplier was stunning - we had a weekend package which all the guests raved about. That coupled with the unlimited drinks pages made it the perfect venue for us. A Devon treasure that feels like being on a film set - everyone loved it!
V135,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Such a beautiful venue - we loved it so much. The food was incredible and despite having a changeover of wedding planner close to the wedding day, it had no impact on our day what so ever. The venue are calm and professional and loved their approach to communication which was friendly."
V135,Kingston Estate Totnes,Fell in love with the venue on our first visit. We were particularly looking for a venue which could cater us for 3 days and sleep the majority of the the guests. The grounds were well kept especially the walled garden which is where the ceremony took place. The team were a pleasure and made the day truly special.
V135,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Our 3-day wedding celebrations were spent at the STUNNING Kingston Estate - a truly unique venue that we absolutely fell in love with. It had EVERYTHING we were looking for & more. The grounds are perfectly manicured all year round & come complete with walled garden. The cottages & main house are beautifully decorated, providing luxurious accommodation for 86 of our guests. Sarah & the team were such a pleasure to work with & couldn’t do enough for us. The catering was also top notch. Thank you"
V135,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue was great we had a few personal health issues beforehand but the team went above and beyond to make the day extra special. The wedding planner organised everything for us and they had plenty of props on site that we were free to use. We had the whole place to ourselves for the weekend it was brilliant and our friends loved the hot tub and pool.
V136,Holmewood Hall,"We were married at Holmewood Hall on 15th February 2025 and I can honestly say that it was the most magical day. We went to visit the venue and instantly fell in love with it but even we were blown away by how beautiful everything looked on the day. All of the staff were amazing - special shoutout to our personal wedding manager, Laura Pike, who was always on hand to answer any questions - she couldn’t do enough for us! The food was wonderful & we had full control over the menu. Would highly recommend this venue, you won’t regret it!"
V136,Holmewood Hall,"Holmewood Hall was an absolutely perfect wedding venue. The house is stunning, well cared for and beautifully decorated. All of the staff are so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Our Wedding Coordinator was fantastic, available from early morning of the wedding and was still there the morning after working for us. The food was excellent, drinks and canapes were amazing and the venue took care of everything for us. We had the most perfect wedding and are so pleased we chose Holmewood Hall. The Gold Room where we had our ceremony is gorgeous. Thank you for giving us a beautiful wedding!"
V136,Holmewood Hall,"I cannot fault this venue at all, the venue itself is breathtakingly beautiful with magnificent rooms and very lovingly maintained grounds. The staff are incredibly friendly, professional and efficient, our wedding coordinator Lee was a pleasure to work with and made our special day run smoothly. If you want a hassle free wedding with breathtaking grounds and the most amazing staff then this is the venue for you."
V136,Holmewood Hall,"Had the most amazing wedding here recently and cannot recommend it enough.

The venue itself is stunning and the options included in the luxe package covered everything we could've possibly wanted and made planning the wedding 100x less stressful.

The staff were all amazing from start to finish, Katie showed us around initially and then Lee was our personal wedding manager, and they were both incredible throughout. Always on hand to answer any questions and help us through the day once we got there.
We had so many comments from our guests on how lovely the staff were on the day!

A particular highlight though was the food - the tasting evening was a dream and the chef went above and beyond to provide a full vegan menu for us which wasn't limited to only a couple of options.
Again, we had so many non-vegan guests complimenting the food and saying how lovely it was!

Overall, an incredible day and an incredible venue.
Thank you so much to everyone there!"
V136,Holmewood Hall,"This place is simply just amazing 🤩
We had our wedding here on 17-12-24 and it was everything we dreamed of and more. The food, staff, decor were just perfect not forgetting the most beautiful Christmas tree 😍
Our person wedding planner Lee was an absolute god send not just having him there on the day but always being at the end of a phone to answer any questions or worry’s.
If we could go back and do it all again we would and not change a single thing.
The most perfect day at the most perfect venue ♥️"
V136,Holmewood Hall,Perfect venue for a wedding with guest numbers 60 - 100. Our guests and I moved from each room to a new room throughout the day and every room had a new surprise. The bridal suite was lush and it was great having all our guests staying under one roof. I would 100% recommend this to anyone.
V136,Holmewood Hall,"The wedding day and lead up to the day were fab. However, for the price we paid, we expected a little bit more.
I opted to use the bridal cottage the evening before for which we paid £450 extra. This is something I now regret, as there was no hot water and we were not able to order any food in as all the take away options were shut (on a Friday night). The hot tub also needed a good clean. So the night before/morning of my wedding was not ideal. I flagged this to the manager who advised that we should have raised the cold water issue as soon as possible, but seeing as we were trying to have morning showers on the wedding day, this did not leave us any time.
Our package included pre-drinks, wine with dinner and we also purchased a cocktail ""cart"" (cocktails on a table) and a bucket of beers. The groom, who is not a wine fan, asked for a beer with his wedding meal and was presented with a contactless card machine to pay for it at the top table. We felt this was a bit unnecessary as there was a full bucket of extra beers outside and it felt a little embarrassing having a card machine presented to us at the top table on our wedding day for one measly Corona, despite the huge amount we had paid. Also, guests were unknowingly allowed to buy beers from the bar after the meal, despite there being available beers to them already in a bucket next to the bar...
Overall the wedding was lovely, but for the price we paid we expected a bit better. Essentially, I loved the venue, but I wish we had not purchased any extras!"
V136,Holmewood Hall,"We got married at Holmewood Hall on 4th October 2024. From the first moment we stepped into the venue and I saw the magnificent Gold room I knew this would be the perfect place for us to get married. We had the most amazing day which was perfectly coordinated by the whole team at Holmewood but especially so by our personal wedding manager Lee. Lee was always quick to respond to any questions we had in the lead up to the day and nothing was too much trouble for him.
We honestly wish we could do it all over again as it was a magical day. We would recommend Holmewood Hall to anyone looking for the perfect venue."
V136,Holmewood Hall,"After getting engaged in late March this year we wanted to get married fairly quickly so booked Holmewood for the same September. The venue, grounds, accomodation were all stunning and we felt very fortunate it was within budget and the package we got was outstanding in comparison to other venues and what it included, which was far far more than other venues. We got to attend a luxe event to choose all our wedding food, canapés, cocktails and wines which should have made things easier but due to the unbelievable quality it made it harder! Our wedding planner Lee is literally the most fantastic person. He was flexible, fun, engaged and on absolutely everything. The day was ran impeccably and also smooth even with some weather concerns and speeches taking a bit longe than we thought. If you book here ask for Lee!! We had the most perfect day. Can’t fault a single things. Our guests all told us how incredible everything was with one even saying he will now longer not attend any further weddings unless it’s at Holmewood. Thank you to all the staff and as mentioned a huge special thank you to Lee! Your a legend!"
V136,Holmewood Hall,"Exceptional venue, stunning grounds, fantastic DJ, and excellent service. Highly recommended! Happiest day of my life 😊"
V137,Bourton Hall,"We got married at Bourton Hall on 08 March 2025 and our wedding planner was Harminder. The day was absolutely amazing from start to finish. All the food and drinks were of a high standard and presented beautifully which includes the wedding breakfast, canapés and cocktails, and breakfast the next day. The venue is gorgeous with lots of rooms, well maintained grounds and exclusive use. The staff are friendly and accommodating and the event was really well managed. We would like to particularly thank Harminder, who was supportive throughout the wedding planning process and the wedding day, ensuring things ran smoothly and in a timely manner. He is a great communicator, provided advice and guidance where needed and attention to detail. We really had a magical day! Thank you so much! We would happily do it all over again and would definitely recommend this venue!"
V137,Bourton Hall,"What a fabulous wedding venue! Because it's a wedding venue and not a hotel that holds the occasional wedding, they really focused on what was important and anticipated our every need. It's an elegant venue but with a comfortable feel to it. The team are incredibly accommodating and helpful and each couple is allocated their own personal wedding manager to guide them through the process and to make sure every detail is covered.
There's a beautiful chapel on site where non-religious ceremonies can be held - this was fabulous.
The food was plentiful and delicious - all our guests raved about it. Great choice of welcome drinks and canapes, wines and cocktails.
The grounds are gorgeous; a perfect backdrop for our October wedding.
The venue was exclusively ours and has beautiful bedrooms, including a huge, stunning bridal suite. Most of our guests stayed overnight and took advantage of the brilliant breakfast in the morning so it really extended the celebration."
V137,Bourton Hall,"Our wedding at Bourton Hall was better than we ever imagined. The Italianate mansion is truly spectacular inside and out however it is the team that made our day run perfectly. Our guests found the setting and the food incredible, they were very impressed! Our wedding planner Emily Sarjant was fantastic her knowledge and expertise made our day magical from start to finish, with all the special touches that she suggested. Our first dance was created in such a beautiful way it will be a memory we cherish forever. Thank you to Emily and the team at Bourton Hall. My husband would also like to note that the croquembouche was amazing and everyone should have one."
V137,Bourton Hall,"My wife and I got married at Bourton Hall in September, with our wedding managed by the wonderful Eleni. Everything about the day went as perfectly as we could've wished, right from arrival to departure the following day. The venue is stunning, and the food was lovely, and having 21 bedrooms on site was such a bonus so that all of our close friends and family could stay on site with us.
Bourton Hall did everything they could both in the run up to the day and on the day itself to alleviate all stress to ensure everything ran as seamlessly as possible, which it absolutely did.
We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall enough."
V137,Bourton Hall,"We were married on 28th July 2024. What an amazing day we had at Bourton Hall. Could not fault it! The venue is so elegant! The grounds and views were to die for. The food was out of this world with so many choices and all cooked and served to perfection. Accommodation / rooms were plentiful and luxurious. Lovely to have a chapel on site too. We had the whole place to ourselves, we felt like royalty! Lots of varied rooms and areas for people to choose where they wanted to be after the wedding breakfast. We would choose the venue all over again!"
V137,Bourton Hall,"We had both our wedding ceremony and reception at Bourton Hall and the service was superb throughout. The house and grounds are beautiful with amazing views to go with them. The staff were professional and helpful during the lead up to our wedding day and during the day as well - even when we had an emergency prior to the ceremony which caused delays, the venue staff were able to work around this to move timings back in order to allow all of our planned activities to go ahead and be fully enjoyed. All the food was delicious and we had a wonderful wedding day thanks to Bourton Hall."
V137,Bourton Hall,"We had the most perfect wedding day at Bourton Hall. Throughout the planning process and on the day, the team were so professional, which meant we could relax and know that everything was in their capable hands - Emily was an amazing wedding manager. The building is beautiful inside and out, and the grounds are stunning - there are so many places for beautiful photos, and views out over the countryside. The food was absolutely delicious, it was so hard to choose what to have! It was also so helpful to have so many places for guests to sit and chat in the evening, away from the disco room but still part of the action. Having so many bedrooms onsite (not to mention a stunning bridal suite!) was an added bonus. We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall highly enough, and have had so many comments from guests saying what a beautiful, elegant but relaxed day it was, so I know they really appreciated everything Bourton has to offer too. Thank you so much to Emily and the whole team for giving us such a perfect day!"
V137,Bourton Hall,"As the Bride and Groom we were made to feel like nothing was too much to ask and they couldn't do enough to make us feel special.
All the guests commented that it was one of the prettiest and most relaxed weddings they have been to.
We could not have asked for a better wedding day thanks to Bourton!"
V137,Bourton Hall,"I had my wedding on 10/02/2024 I am so happy I chose this venue, It is really magical. My wedding manager was just the best! Emily went above and beyond to help me on my big day! I cannot thank her enough.

One of the main things about this venue is that t has its own chappel which is really special and makes you wedding seem more traditional, however there are more options/ rooms available. I wanted the wow factor and I got it.

Some of the options that made it great

*Onsite accommodation for night before and night of the wedding is really helpful
*Exclusive use
*Dedicated wedding manager definate gamechanger! (Emily)
*Menu choices are fantastic.

Everyone commented on the food being really nice ( we had the lamb) The evening buffet was also great. I paid extra to have a meal created as having part of my culture within the food at the wedding was very important to me, they did not disappoint.
Emily was perfect in so many ways, she knew exactly my vision once i explained it to her and she made sure that it became real for me. She adapted parts of the day so that it would work better, for example bringing the canapes outside whilst photos where being taken. Helping me into my dress, looking after my phone just everything I needed she was there. She really worked hard to make sure it run perfectly and it did.

Thank you emily!!! You made my day Great."
V137,Bourton Hall,We got married at Bourton Hall on 30th July 2023. It was the most amazing day ever! We are still receiving compliments from our guests on how stunning the venue was and the whole running of the day. This was 100% down to our wedding co-ordinator Harminder. He went above and beyond to ensure our day was absolutely perfect. He literally could not have done any more! Thank you again Harminder!!
V138,B&H Buildings,Bourne & Hollingsworth was such an exceptional venue for our wedding this September. This is the perfect place for you if you want a true London wedding that feels like a fun dinner/house party but on an epic scale. We used the top floor (the studios) for our sit down dinner (think candle light and tasty roast lamb) and headed downstairs for our reception with the basement club (below and hidden) for late night dancing. The place is stunning (greenery and glass everywhere and the cocktails are insane but what really makes this place are the people. The whole staff from Matt and Lizzie to the bar team to the dinner crew made our whole day seamless and so fun. Could not recommend B&H more highly for your London wedding.
V138,B&H Buildings,"Beautiful wedding celebration in the most stylish venue - we had an intimate wedding reception (drinks, dinner and more drinks!) at the Bourne & Hollingsworth Buildings. The staff members on duty were excellent - nothing was too much trouble and they served everyone with such professionalism. We couldn’t recommend it highly enough and we haven’t stopped talking about it since. All of our guests were so impressed with the space and how stylish it was. The bar, restaurant and greenhouse are all aesthetically beautiful and the botanical vibes make for a very relaxed, but premium setting. Special shout out to Lizzie who helped us coordinate everything and Matt on the day who led the team. Thank you so much - we had the best day and we couldn’t have wished to host it in a better venue."
V138,B&H Buildings,"India & the B&H team were seamless. Flexible, responsive, kind, and easy to deal with. They made our day so special. The food was fantastic, the drinks were lovely, and the value for money was first rate!"
V139,Leez Priory,"I never in my life thought I would get married in a place like Leez priory! The whole experience from start to finish was just fantastic. The price breakdown was manageable and there was no pressure to take any upgrades offered. The things we got in our package were phenomenal and having a wedding planner was tremendous - our lady (Leanne) was an absolute god send!
They catered to all our needs and we were made to feel so comfortable and nothing was a problem! I’d highly suggest going to an event there before hand, just to get a feel of what it’s like full of people and enjoy their delicious food. We actually enjoyed their entertainer ( singer) so much we hired him for our wedding ☺️
Lee priory is just so beautiful. I can’t speak highly enough x"
V139,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory on the 7th of September 2024. Considering how long they have been a wedding venue, they were pretty flexible with some of the ideas we had for the venue styling that turned out amazingly!

The staff really made the day something special and couldn't have done enough for us. Special mention must be made for Leanne, our wedding planner, who was amazing!

Highly recommend the venue and the incredible team that helped to make our day so special!"
V139,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in October 2024. This venue is stunning both inside and out with immaculately kept grounds and interior. The hospitality in the lead up to and on the day of the wedding was fantastic. The food was also brilliant. Another great perk of this venue is the amount of on site accommodation.

A couple of drawbacks / experiences during our wedding. There are only a few toilets in the main building which kept blocking and overflowing throughout the evening which led to us taking some guests to the dressing room or honeymoon cottage to use the facilities. You are also restricted by the venue on any external food or drink suppliers and the venues optional extras for this are quite expensive for what they are.

That asaide, we had the best day and evening at Leez Priory and would certainly recommend it!"
V139,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in August 2024- great venue and experience from initial viewing to leaving the morning after the wedding. Leanne acted as our wedding planner and was friendly, professional and helpful throughout. We opted for the classic package and the food was amazing quality with everyone commenting how full they were!
The venue is beautiful with several options for ceremony both inside and out. Accommodation was great too. The whole day ran smoothly with perfect weather - we will have very happy memories of our day!"
V139,Leez Priory,"Perfect venue and very attentive staff, lovely food and great communication from start to finish"
V139,Leez Priory,"Stunning venue. Fantastic Team. Very accommodating toward our unique ""surprise"" strategy. Our guests were truly surprised. Thank you."
V139,Leez Priory,"Leez priory was the 1st and only venue we looked around when we started planning our wedding. From the moment we stepped on the premises, everything just looked so perfect and exactly what we wanted from a wedding venue. When we got assigned our wedding co-ordinator Rachel, she was just absolutely spot on with everything we asked for and nothing was too big an ask for her. She made sure the day ran as smoothly as possible and took care of any issue that arose without me knowing (which I am forever grateful for!!)
The rest of the staff were amazing and very helpful.

The venue itself is just absolutely stunning and we loved that it has the pub area as well as the dance floor so it catered to all of our guests.

All of the rooms were lovely and it was so nice being able to stay in the fisherman’s lodge onsite the night before the wedding.

We genuinely cannot recommend this venue enough and it was 100% worth the money! 10/10!"
V139,Leez Priory,"We got married on a Tuesday in October to maximise the value of what we could get for our money; and honestly, we got everything we wanted and more. Leanne, our Wedding Manager was perfect at bringing an attention to detail and seamless organisation to the big day, and in the lead up. There wasn't one moment of the day where we felt stressed, as Leanne had it covered. In one particular instance, our flowers for the bridal party's hair hadn't arrived. Within five minutes of telling Leanne that we needed this, the flowers were with our hair and make-up suppliers to add the finishing touches.

Leez Priory as a venue is the most stunning setting, and offers an incredible range of areas in which the ceremony and reception can take place. There is also the opportunity for the bridal party to make use of the Fisherman's Cottage the night before the wedding, and for people to stay in the on-site accommodation on the evening of the wedding, making it the perfect venue for people also travelling from further afield.

Leez Priory were very accommodating, welcoming and were happy to work with us to make our day as perfect as possible. The food was incredible, and a total hit with all of our guests, and so many people have commented on how incredible the day was as a whole. You wouldn't be disappointed to choose Leez Priory."
V139,Leez Priory,They catered to our every need. To when we would ask for things they hadn’t been done before they still made sure it went smoothly. Leanne was amazing she made me feel so comfortable from the start. The whole day was stunning. Beautiful venue please go view it as you will not be disappointed
V139,Leez Priory,We got married on the 26 May 2024. This venue was absolutely brilliant! They catered for every need and made sure there was no stress on the day. Leanne was kind and level headed throughout and was always one step ahead! Do not hesitate to book- do it now!
V140,London Rowing Club,"We picked this place because we wanted somewhere fairly central and casual. We fell in love with the long room and the view. Our wedding was in October so we thought we'd have it cosy but we ended up with a beautiful autumnal day so everyone was on the balcony. The fairy lights were perfect and the other rooms were great to avoid leaving. The staff was so friendly and accommodating that we would definitely recommend the venue.

The only thing that could have tainted the day is that after three visits and many emails, we were never told that the river floods (a lot). We were flexible with our day so if we knew this we would have built it into our day, instead, I was told by the photographer on the day as I got out of the taxi that we wouldn't be able to take any group photos because the area would be flooded during the cocktail hour and half that we had assigned as photo time. This would have been disappointing but we all ended up running outside after the ceremony to take photos before the tide came in. My husband and I borrowed wellies for our couple photos. We had fun doing this, but I can imagine many couples being upset! My friend's electric car also flooded and they were obviously upset."
V140,London Rowing Club,"Annabel was meticulous in her help planning the wedding. Very knowledgeable and helpful.
On the day the rest of the staff were brilliant - there wasn’t an empty glass in the house.
Great venue at a reasonable price on the London riverside."
V140,London Rowing Club,"LRC was the perfect place to celebrate our wedding this summer. The venue staff went above and beyond to ensure that everything went as planned both before and during the event. Thanks in particular to Annabel who was responsive, helpful and always put us at ease in the build up. The location is stunning - couldn’t have asked for a better day!"
V140,London Rowing Club,"We just wanted to say an enormous thank you for everything. From the moment we came to visit the LRC on a slightly grey January weekend, we knew it would be a fabulous venue for our June wedding reception and it certainly did not disappoint. It really is the most beautiful setting and we have very fond memories of our guests enjoying drinks in the sunshine with the most fantastic view over the Thames. The venue has such character and lends itself beautifully to a wedding reception. We have received so many compliments from our guests and I would encourage anyone thinking about booking their wedding at the LRC to do it, you will not regret it! We were lucky to be blessed with beautiful weather so were able to have our jazz musicians play on the balcony for the drinks reception before moving into the Long Room for our meal. It looked stunning with the tables dressed and mantles adorned with flowers. Following the meal and speeches, guests enjoyed drinks back on the balcony and in the Fairburn and Members Rooms which provide plenty of seating, whilst the Long Room was cleared and the band set up. We then partied the night away.

From start to finish, the organisation was so straight forward. Annabel was very accommodating and full of helpful advice in the run up. I knew that on the day she would ensure things ran like clock work, which of course they did. Our suppliers also commented on how helpful the LRC team were to work with. On the day the staff were brilliant and went out of their way to ensure everything ran smoothly (including borrowing some large gym fans from the rowers to put in the Long Room to keep us cool as it was an unexpectedly hot day). We really can’t thank you enough and now need to think of an excuse to host another party with you in the future!"
V140,London Rowing Club,"We got married in St. Mary's church and then had our reception in the London Rowing Club in February 2023. It far exceeded our expectations and was an incredible fabulous stress-free day with thanks to the wonderful Annabel making the day just run.

In the lead up to the event, Annabel was incredibly responsive, helpful and helped us plan the day exactly how we wanted it. She answered all our questions really quickly, always got back to us, was very flexible with what we could do and allowing us to personalise the space. Prior to the event, Annabel arranged for us to go and have a look around on a couple of additional occasions to help us plan how we would want it to look. She also gave our caterers a tour of the kitchens as they were new to the venue.

In the immediate lead up to the day, Annabel helped with our suppliers in getting chairs delivered and bringing all the wine over a day earlier. On the day, she helped to make the day flow and just dealt with things throughout the day.

The venue itself is beautiful with three rooms to use. A middle reception room, a cosy snug and the main long room. In the main long room, there is a rowing boat hanging upside down with fairly lights. The main lighting can be dimmed and gave a wonderful atmosphere for the evening meal. As our wedding was a winter wedding, it was fairly chilly so they lit fires in the main room and snug which added to the atmosphere.

We had around 90 guests - could have fitted a few more just about. We used the round tables, tablecloths, linen, plates cutlery and glasses provided and they were perfect for a wedding and looked very smart. No need to hire these. As mentioned, we did hire separate wedding chairs instead of the conference chairs provided. There's a lot of decoration in the way of rowing memorabilia on the walls which means you don't have to actually do too much to make it interesting for guests.

Overall, the perfect London wedding venue with absolutely fabulous views across the Thames with a long balcony to enjoy from. To top it off Annabel is truly amazing and so helpful."
V140,London Rowing Club,"We had our wedding (ceremony+reception) at LRC in July, and the venue itself and the team we worked with were absolutely incredible! Everything on the day went without a hitch and we heard so many compliments on the location - our guests loved the balcony and the layout inside, which included plenty of space for anyone wanting a break from dancing to sit down and relax. Would recommend to anyone looking to host an event!"
V140,London Rowing Club,"London Rowing Club is a truly fantastic venue and we were both so delighted with how our day went! The venue has real character with the classic rowing memorabilia and it’s location on the Thames, and looks amazing when it’s all set up. The layout and size of rooms I thought were perfect for our wedding of about 70 (+15ish more in the evenings) and of course the big attraction is the balcony which all of our guests adored!! (I wish I’d had more time during the day to stand out there and enjoy it 😂). Not only is it a fantastic venue in a great location but what really made this the most amazing venue was how great all of the staff, and all the recommend suppliers were! The day exceeded expectations and we got compliments on the place and the staff from all our guests. Couldn’t be happier with the venue, it was perfect for us!!"
V140,London Rowing Club,"We found the London Rowing Club while desperately combing through London locations after our original venue fell through a few months before the day.
Luckily for us it was available due to a cancellation - kismet!
From the start the charming Annabel put us very much at ease and helped us to envisage the day as we hoped it would be. She was very flexible and helpful throughout the planning process.
We were incredibly lucky with the weather on the day and the venue really came into its own - it was virtually impossible to get guests off the terrace, which is the perfect size for our smallish event (65 people) and of course offers gorgeous river views.
We were well looked after by the team and everything went off without a hitch. The interior of the space itself is lovely with a great sense of history.
Nice additional touch - table tennis was made available in the entry room for the later part of the evening!

It's a special place and I'd thoroughly recommend for anyone seeking a memorable spot to tie the knot!"
V140,London Rowing Club,"We got married at the London Rowing Club on a brilliantly sunny winter day on Saturday. All the way through in the run up (after 2 years or more of postponements), Annabel and team bent over backwards to help us arrange everything, recommended some brilliant suppliers for food (Shona Pollock comes highly recommended) and flowers (same with Steph the charityflorist.)

So many of our guests said how lovely the venue and staff were on the day, and the whole place looked a million dollars with an amazing photo set on and around the balcony and river - although we haven't seen those yet. The corkage and bar tariff prices are also incredibly reasonable for an inner London location!

I can't recommend the LRC highly enough. It will live in memory for a very long time."
V140,London Rowing Club,"The London Rowing Club team alongside the Dinner Ladies went above and beyond to ensure that we had the wedding perfectly fitting our requirements. Throughout the entire all of the suppliers worked seamlessly together to ensure the space transformed as we progressively added guests and transitioned between eating, our ceremony, more eating, music and dancing. We wouldn’t have had it any other way. The attention to detail of the team is second to none - perfect for any bride and groom seeking a beautiful event."
V141,The Prince Albert,"The team at The Prince Albert were always accommodating, made everything easy and stress-free, and helped us organise an amazing wedding party. They really knew what they were doing, and helped guide us through the process calmly, working around our schedule (which wasn't easy - we live abroad!) to make sure all our last-minute worries and concerns were sorted smoothly. The food was excellent, and the space was fantastic for our party. Can't recommend it highly enough!"
V141,The Prince Albert,"We had such a happy wedding with Harrison and this venue. Harrison was really flexible and answered any questions we had and made great suggestions when we needed seating arrangements, the schedule for the day, a florist, and more. The day was accessible to everyone and the food and drink were perfect. Thank you for making out wedding stress free and wonderful."
V141,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert was the most wonderful venue for our London wedding. We came across the venue at there wedding fair and chose alot of our suppliers from the same wedding fair.

Harrison and Lauren were always so on hand to help with any questions and did a fantastic job answering all of our questions. The staff were so friendly and helpful and made everything run like clockwork.

We couldn’t recommend The Prince Albert enough for a london wedding and would love to do it all again."
V141,The Prince Albert,"My wife and I were beyond happy with how everything went on our wedding day. Harrison, Diana, Claudio and the whole team were absolutely phenomenal! It was such a beautifully efficient operation, and we always felt like someone was there to help us when needed.

We've had dozens of compliments about the great food and how wonderfully intimate the venue was for a wedding. Some of our more traditional relatives said they were initially sceptical at the prospect of a pub wedding, but that it was one of the most beautiful and joyful weddings they’d been to. A friend of mine was also very happy that someone at the bar remembered her drink order throughout the evening! On top of that, everything ran perfectly to schedule, which is no doubt down to the high attention to detail.

It was very useful that the upstairs was free on Friday afternoon so that we could set up the space. It gave us plenty of time to do the flower arrangements, put up the bunting, and stick photos on the frame wall.

Thank you again so much for all the help and support you've given us - it really was the best day of our lives (so far)!"
V141,The Prince Albert,"My husband and I got married here in late September 2023, and I cannot recommend the Prince Albert enough!! Booking a wedding venue can be stressful and we felt like a lot of the venues we looked at gave us the ""hard sell"" but the folks at the Prince Albert helped to put us at ease every step of the way. We fell in love with how beautiful the pub was, so hired the upstairs for the ceremony, wedding breakfast and party afterwards for around 40 - 45 people. We were able to drop off decorations the night before and talk it all through with the staff, and they did such a good job of working with us and the florist to get the place looking amazing. The ceremony went off without a hitch, everybody loved the food and we had a blast in the evening. All the staff were amazing, but special shout out to Harrison and Lauren for helping us plan and run the day, and Maria for managing everything on the ground both when we dropped off the decorations and during the wedding itself. Thank you again for helping us celebrate our special day with our loved ones, for making it so stress free and so memorable!"
V141,The Prince Albert,"All you ever hear about wedding venues is that everything is a rip off, the food is meh, and there are a ton of annoying restrictions...the opposite is true of Harrison and The Prince Albert team. From Day 1, Harrison made the whole process not only easy but really fun! He was quick to respond, super knowledgeable, and very accommodating; he even helped our best man execute a surprise for us without it disrupting any timings. On the day, they decorated the place beautifully, managed to serve a 3 course dinner to 76 people unbelievably fast, and everyone raved about the food - to say they did a good job is a gross understatement, they went above and beyond. We were after ""classy fun"" and that's exactly what we got - thank you so so much!"
V141,The Prince Albert,"We had the exact wedding reception we wanted at the Prince Albert thanks to Harrison, Claudio and the other amazing staff who helped us feel so relaxed in the build up and during. We wanted a very low-key vibe and the team understood that but there were enough options for any style of wedding you wanted. The upstairs function room felt cozy and intimate while still leaving breathing room and space to dance, but you could easily rent the whole place if you wanted more guests and even choose to do your ceremony there. We had the most compliments on our food (we chose a buffet option). The team were particularly accomodating to some complicated dietary requirements and it was all delicious."
V141,The Prince Albert,"July 6, 2023 was the most memorable day of our lives! A big thank you to Harrison and the rest of the team for assisting us through out the whole process. Our guests loved the Prince Albert pub especially the sumptuous food and booze on our wedding day!

David & Dannah"
V141,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert is a Great venue for the classic Pub Wedding.
Harrison and the team did an amazing job to organize everything. The food was great and the service first class. Only sorry it was over so quickly. Thanks again for everything."
V141,The Prince Albert,"We found The Prince Albert when our original venue cancelled on us less than 2 months before our wedding. & we are so glad we did; everything happens for a reason! From the moment we met Harrison, we knew we were in safe hands, and the team at the Prince Albert made our day amazing. The pub looked beautiful and we were very greatful for the effort the team put in putting up all our decorations. We had so many compliments about the food, and we were very impressed in the swift and organised manner in whichever it was served. Everyone had a wonderful time, and we would not hesitate in recommending The Prince Albert."
V142,Kindred,"We chose Kindred for our 60 person wedding and it could not have been better. We wanted a venue where we could have the ceremony, dinner and dancing all under one roof, that was wheelchair accessible, and easy to get to on the tube, Kindred ticks all those boxes and more!
The food is incredible, we really enjoyed popping by to do all the tastings, we'll continue to come to the Cellar for food and cocktails. Many guests commented on how good the food was.
The place itself is gorgeous, inside and out. We used the whole venue, the main Hall for the ceremony, dinner and dancing, and the Library upstairs for the drinks reception and cake cutting. Also, being right next to Hammersmith station, the venue could not be easier to get to!
The staff are wonderfully attentive and helpful, both before and on the day. They were really open to the little details that made our day uniquely ours, from the drinks selections, to having a table and glasses on stage for the ceremony, to playing our music selections at the right time. Plus its a dog friendly venue!"
V142,Kindred,"We LOVE this venue! We got married here with only 12 weeks notice and Anna, the owner, and her staff went above and beyond to make the day as memorable, magical, and marvellous as we'd hoped it would be. The venue is elegant, stylish and perfect for a London, city based wedding. The food is sensational as it comes from their in-house kitchen on the ground floor and every guest remarked on how delicious their meal was. It's restaurant quality food, not your standard wedding food. The place looks stunning in all our wedding photos and the wedding cake they made us (at very short notice I might add!) was second to none. Everyone loved it. The venue was also perfect for late night dancing and drinking and merriment. It was such a pleasure - and a breeze - to work with Anna and her team on one of the most important days of my life, and I very much hope to do so again in the future. I will forever be grateful to her and all she helped us with."
V142,Kindred,"We had our wedding reception for 35 guests at Kindred, in the Library and Salon earlier this year. The day went incredibly smoothly, the staff couldn't have been more attentive and our guests raved about the food for weeks afterwards. It was the perfect sized space for our intimate celebration, really cosy and the atmosphere was great. The little touches really helped to make the day special, with espresso martinis served for the speeches and sparklers for our exit at the end of the night. Thanks again to the lovely Kindred team!"
V142,Kindred,"I cannot find a single fault in our experience with Kindred for our wedding. Not only was it a stunning venue that honestly made some of our guests gasp as they arrived, but Anna and the team were so incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. Having them support us really took so much of the wedding planning stress away and we knew we were in safe hands. I really appreciated that the team were happy to chat through ideas with me and were always keen to find creative solutions to give us the day that we had envisioned.

The food was absolutely delicious and they were so accommodating for our long list of dietary requirements from our guest. The cocktails were also so delicious. Our guests were buzzing for weeks after, as were we.

On the night, the staff were not only incredibly helpful and efficient, but also just so friendly, welcoming and complimentary. We felt thoroughly spoilt and very well looked after.

We visited so many venues and this was by far the best choice for us. The interiors made for some stunning photos and the layout of the spacing meant that whilst we had 80-100 guests, it still felt very intimate. I cannot recommend Kindred enough!"
V142,Kindred,"We would give a thousand stars if we could. Kindred hosted us for our cocktail style wedding and it was everything we could have hoped for and the perfect venue for this style of wedding. The wine, cocktails and food (incredible grazing board, canapés, bowls and pizzas) were exceptional and the team were on top of everything, friendly and nothing was ever an issue. We would HIGHLY recommend it. We have had loads of guests message us to tell us what a spectacular venue it was with the most friendly team. The venue had different spaces to suit our needs and the AV is amazing - it worked perfectly for our live music band and our DJ, and our own music playlists for our ceremony. They took the stress off planning and really did mean we could relax and not worry that everything would run smoothly. Thank you so much Kindred team for giving us the best day of our lives"
V143,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The best day of our lives and me and my now husband couldn't be more thankful to Bredenbury. Before booking Bredenbury we visited over 17 wedding venues in Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Herefordshire - we fell in love instantly, there is no need for a crazy amount of extra expense on decorations, the venue speaks for itself. The fact that it was no corkage just added to why we wanted to book and the team were so friendly. In the lead up to the wedding they were brilliant, we booked far in advance and brought over all our family members to come see the venue, they were so flexible, understanding and welcoming - they couldn't do enough for us. On the wedding day they had decorated for us by the time we had arrived and all we had to do on the day was to enjoy it - which was perfect. It really was the best day of our lives, all the comments from our family and friends was how beautiful the venue was. They kept the day running so smooth and we didn't need to think about a thing."
V143,Bredenbury Court Barns,"There truly aren't words to describe how incredible Bredenbury Court Barns and their entire team of fantastic staff were through the planning process and the day itself. They were so friendly, supportive and nothing was ever too much. From quick replies to any questions that popped to mind to planning meetings that left us feeling prepared and ready to the day being set up beyond perfectly. Our amazing wedding coordinator Lianna spent the days and months (years really!) leading up to our big day making sure everyone detail was perfect, that everything was incorporated that we'd dreamed of and made sure we didn't feel a moment of stress from start to finish. All throughout the building from the bridal booth, to the orangery to the oak barn was beautifully light and open - even with our wedding being the end of October - and we had so many compliments about this! There aren't enough words to say thank you and explain just how much we'd recommend this venue to everyone"
V143,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We had the perfect day back in July. The weather didn't go to plan but they helped make the day so special even with the last minute switches because of the rain. We had such an amazing day and the feedback from our guests about the venue, food and service was great! We cannot thank the team enough for the effort they put in throughout the whole process but especially on the day. We felt incredibly supported throughout the whole process."
V143,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The venue itself is stunning. The buildings, grounds and interior decorations are all beautiful and immaculately presented. From the moment you turn down the lane it is so picturesque, you know you've found somewhere special. It's exactly what we were imagining for our wedding venue.

The layout is perfect, with ample space for guests to mingle and move about, and great accessibility for older and disabled guests. Ours was a winter wedding, and while most of the day was inside it wasn't cramped and we could still enjoy the beautiful grounds through the expansive windows that run along the whole barn.

All of the venue is stunning, but practicality-wise the Bridal Suite warrants a special mention. Room length mirrors, plenty of room for the bridal party to get ready, have their makeup and hair done, and if there's time to relax as well. Drinks were served from 11 onwards, and it has it's own toilets and shower.

From our first meeting at Bredenbury the staff were exceptional. They gave a reassuring air of professionalism and experience, with just the right level of excitedness for our day without it feeling forced. We were really impressed by how responsive the whole team were, with speedy replies to any questions we had during the planning. This is something we particularly appreciated as we only gave ourselves 7 weeks to plan our big day.

Value for money wise it felt tricky to gauge when we were trying to choose a venue as the headline figure is rarely what you'll end up paying, with different venues charging different amounts for different things. Not the case with Bredenbury. With their No Corkage policy and generosity in being able to use whatever props they already have, any extras were non-essentials of our own choosing.

No Corkage is pretty significant. Some venues wanted to charge £20/bottle, so not having to pay this and being able to supply not only our own wine but beers, gin and soft drinks for the drinks reception and wedding breakfast was not only a massive saving but also made the occasion more personal for us. The bar staff and catering team were excellent, pouring and serving drinks, warming our mulled wine and setting up the gin bar. Once your guests have drunk you dry the venue's bar is well stocked and standard pub pricing.

We wanted a Christmas wedding and seeing in early November that they had a date available that December we couldn't resist. 7 weeks isn't long to organise a wedding with nearly 100 guests, and we couldn't have done it without the Bredenbury team being so organised. Our assigned event manager, Harriet, was brilliant in the runup and on the day, as were all the other managers and staff we spoke with. The Wedding Bible they fill out with you is a great idea and nails down all the finer details to ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible on the day.

We didn't want to have to spend the day before and morning of our wedding worrying about set up and decorations, but needn't have worried as Bredenbury did all of this for us. A meeting beforehand clarified what we wanted where; we simply dropped off boxes of stuff the day before and rocked up in the morning to find everything laid out as hoped.

This organisation extended to the third party suppliers, of which Bredenbury have an extensive list of local recommendations. We booked the ceiling lights with Cotswold Wedding Co. and didn't have to do anything else. The band, Apollo Gold (incredible!!) set up without any hassle and didn't have any issues with Bredenbury's noise limiter. Our florist Katrina Bevis hadn't been there before, but again had no problem getting everything in place on the morning.

On-site accommodation was good for close family and friends, but there's not enough for the majority of guests and the lack of a dedicated honeymoon suite is a bit of a shame. If you want privacy for your first night as a married couple it means taking over an entire lodge. The quality and comfort of the rooms is excellent, though, and the continental breakfast served the morning after in the East Lodge was delicious, with ample options for Vegan and Gluten Free.

Jenkinsons are the exclusive caterer for Bredenbury and have an extensive menu for nibbles, the wedding breakfast and dinner. The menu and ordering process is clear, and pricing is what we expected to pay. Food and service was as slick and faff-free as everything else. A real delight.

On the day, Harriet and the catering manager were absolute superstars. Zero stress, everything ran to time and as planned, and they were always available if we had any questions or needed help.

The whole day was perfect and exactly what we wanted. I don't think we could have achieved this without the exceptional organisation of Harriet and the team. The entire process was very slick, zero stress, and we wouldn't hesitate in recommending Bredenbury Court Barns to anyone looking to get married in a countryside paradise."
V143,Bredenbury Court Barns,"I want to say a massive thank you to Bredenbury Court Barns for hosting our wedding. From the start they were super amazing and accommodating to us. They won us over with their care and support even when we had a pickle in the beginning.

Olivia was super helpful from the start and throughout the year we were planning she offered huge amount of support and suggestions.

We typed in “orangery weddings” in google when we were first looking because I was keen to get a ceremony in an orangery and Bredenbury popped up after much searching. Once we saw the Orangery we cancelled every other viewing we had across the country because we felt we found the perfect place, and nothing compared to the reception with the beautiful windows that brought all the light in. The grounds were absolutely spectacular and gorgeous. It was a no brainer for us to pick such a beautiful venue. They brought my ideas to life and we were able to get support on anything from recommendation of suppliers, to ideas on decor to their favourite meals from Jenkinson’s. They fully outdid themselves in love for us. We can’t forget it.

Our wedding day was exceptional with Lianna helping us all the way. She was a breath of fresh air. She cared about all the little details and made us feel relaxed and had a good laugh with us. The fact she was there 100% of the way, before the wedding, during the wedding, and even after is unmatched! Thank you Lianna for really being there to make our wedding day smooth and relaxing.

The food was incredible too and we often think about how sad it is that we didn’t finish our second plates, we think about it a lot.

Thank you for the wonderful journey BCB, you blew us away with your integrity, kindness, and genuine support!"
V143,Bredenbury Court Barns,thank you to everyone at bredenbury court barns who made our day so special
V143,Bredenbury Court Barns,"From the moment we stepped foot into Bredenbury Court Barns, we knew this was the venue for us. It was the first and only venue we viewed as we were blown away by how gorgeous the venue is. The venue itself is absolutely stunning, with breathtaking views and impeccably maintained grounds that set the perfect backdrop for our special day.

The staff went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. From our first consultation to the last dance, their professionalism and attention to detail were exceptional. Harriet was absolutely brilliant and I don’t know what we would have done without her!

The food was another highlight—our guests are still talking about how delicious everything was! Jenkinsons are amazing, they helped us personalise our menu perfectly!

We couldn’t have asked for a more beautiful venue to have our wedding. The day couldn’t have been more perfect! Thank you to everyone at Bredenbury Court Barns for making our wedding day nothing short of magical!"
V143,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We could not have had a more perfect experience with Bredenbury Court Barns. Right from initial booking all the way through to breakfast the following morning, everything was perfect. Nothing was too much trouble for our wonderful planner, Lianna. She ensured the day ran smoothly and our months of planning turned out exactly as we’d imagined. They are available to answer any questions you have any time, they’re only an email away and get back to you so fast. The venue itself if just gorgeous, the grounds make for some wonderful photos, and the orangery lets so much light in that your ceremony photos are gorgeous. The whole place is fully air conditioned too which was great for our July wedding. The bridal suite is a perfect balance of being aesthetically pleasing and practical for getting ready in, it’s so spacious, lots of natural light, there’s plenty of plug sockets and huge mirrors so everyone has plenty of room for getting ready and no one is on top of eachother. There’s even an outside space for getting some fresh air. I’m so glad we chose to have our wedding here, it’s given us memories to cherish forever and there are zero memories of any stress!! Cannot recommend this venue enough!"
V143,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We cannot believe how lucky we fell to get married at such a beautiful venue. Right from the offset of viewing the venue, to our special day, we were taken of. No question was too silly, and so much pressure was taken off us during the planning. We managed to make everything our own and Lianna was there every step of the way. Thank you for giving us our happily ever after. We will forever be grateful."
V143,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We loved our wedding at Bredenbury the team did an amazing job providing everything we asked for and more. We especially liked that our wedding coordinator for the day, Harriet had thought of everything for us she went above and beyond and even offered to go and get my mum some more shoes when hers broke! absolute 5-star service and the food was amazing too!"

V145,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow what can I say, Brinsop is an absolutely stunning wedding venue with heaps of character and so many options of places for the ceremony and to do things. We fell in love with it as soon as we saw it and knew it was where we wanted to get married.

Right from the start, the Brinsop team were so helpful and accommodating. From giving an virtual tour then showing us around in person, Issy and the team were fantastic right the way through. Nothing was a hassle, no request too difficult and they were incredibly professional and responsive throughout the whole process.

We loved that Brinsop is an exclusive venue with accommodation on site so we could stay with the bridal party and our immediate family. All the rooms are unique and have so much character and it's fun exploring the whole place. You feel like you are in the middle of nowhere, in nature with swans, ducks and birds all around.

Throughout our planning process, Issy and the team helped us every step of the way, being incredibly flexible in managing our requests and really trying to create our vision. They even got their team to make a giant jenga that we could use on the day! They helped to create the most perfect bespoke wedding breakfast and canapes menu, and seemed so positive and excited to be part of our special day and experience.

Arriving at the venue, Issy and the team were ready and had everything prepared and ready to go. It made the process so smooth for us and meant we could really enjoy the day without any stress. Issy coordinated perfectly with all of our vendors and it really felt like she and the whole team were so happy for us and wanted to be part of our day which was amazing. Our guests commented on how friendly and responsive all the staff were and it really made the experience extra special.

I wouldn't change anything about the day and it was perfect. I would absolutely recommend Brinsop as a wedding venue and all the staff who are really invested in helping deliver your vision. Thank you so so much to the whole team for making this a day that we will look back on for many years to come with amazing memories."
V145,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow, what a perfect day we had! It really went without a hitch and that was thanks to Nina and all the staff at Brinsop. The team worked seamlessly to ensure the day was as perfect as could be, and it really was! The wedding was booked over 2 years in advance and the staff were so accommodating with all my questions, planning and site visits, they couldn’t do more to support us. Special thanks to our coordinator Nina who was a delight to work with and a credit to Brinsop. Everyone that attended agreed at how beautiful the venue and grounds were, it was a wedding people won’t forget! 10/10 would recommend to anyone!"
V145,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"It's taken me quite a while to get round to writing this review, because sadly it's quite a bittersweet one.

We were married last year on 15 June and Brinsop was our chosen venue for both our ceremony and reception. We were first attracted to brinsop by the accomodation, meaning our loved ones could stay on-site, especially my grandparents which was so important to me.

The home itself is absolutely beautiful, including ivy cottage which myself and my mum stayed in the night before the big day. It really was a picture perfect setting, and looking down from the bridal suite seeing the ceremony space being set up on the Wordsworth lawn was honestly magical. Id dreamed of an outdoor wedding on that lawn, and we were so grateful the weather cleared so we could have it. The team really did wait till the latest they could to ask us to make a call on an inside or outside wedding (despite being June, it was a gloomy day to start) which I really appreciated!

Another amazing part of hiring brinsop was the after hours space we were able to enjoy until 2am with our house guests. The games room was absolute fantastic and meant that if you wanted to go to bed you could, but you could also stay up, party and play pool. I really do think this was a highlight for our guests and would recommend massively if you can spare some budget.

On the night of the wedding, myself and my new husband actually stayed in one glamping tents which we absolutely loved. The groundsman was on site until we were ready to leave the games room, and he then took us up to our tent in one of the buggies, making sure we had plenty of blankets and even stopping off for some bottles of water for us. This was really special, and can't thank him enough.

Hugo Spritz!! Having hugos at both our welcome drinks and drinks reception after the ceremony was amazing. I'm not a fan of prosecco myself and Mark and the team made it possible for us to have Hugo's all round. We even sneaked some up to the bridal suite to have before the ceremony (thanks Nadia!). Our guests loved them, and the amount of people that have told me they now need them at their own wedding is crazy!

Onto the not so good - sadly it all started to go a little downhill when we moved things into the knot barn for our wedding breakfast. Sitting on the top table, I could see that guests at the top of the second rows of long tables didn't really even have a seat around the table and were just kind of plonked on. The seating plan hadn't been followed, and I don't think there were even enough tables laid for the service to be comfortable for people because there was a dance floor at the end of the barn (which I did not ask for).

It was quickly also brought to my attention, that one of our guests had had to put her child on her lap in order to remove the high chair so people had more space. We also lost about 5 napkins with them setting on fire from the candles because everything was just way too cramped.

I asked to speak to catering, and asked if there was anything that they could do. I was told 'well sure, if you want the whole thing to be late'. In truth I shouldn't have even had to broach this myself, as it should have been sorted by the coordination team.

The tables weren't changed, even after they'd said they'd sort after the first course and yet the whole meal still ran late. We've had so much feedback about people not having enough food, food not being easy to access on the sharing platters etc and honestly when you've waited so long for a day and had spent 25k on the venue and food alone, it really has been heartbreaking to hear. I do sometimes question why people still bring it up (even now, people talk about the dining) when it clearly upset me so much.

Whilst writing this review my husband asked my what we had for evening food - we didn't get any. It was left unannounced on a back table. I don't know what I was expecting, just not that.

The next morning, the houseguests were asked to come down to breakfast for 9am (it was on a note in the room) but as we were in the glamping area, we walked past the knot barn just before 8.30 and the food was already out. We ran down to the house to hurry everyone up, and by which time everyone arrived it had been sitting there for 20plus mins going cold.

My biggest upset was that when I fed all of the above back to brinsop, feeling pretty deflated about the catering, I was told they'd pass my feedback on and heard absolutely nothing back. 25k total with over 10k on food and drinks to hear absolutely nothing, and this was 9 months ago. I'm not saying this in would happen to anyone else, but really - it shouldn't have happened to us either."
V145,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our wedding! From start to finish, everything at Brinsop was flawless. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most magical backdrop for our special day. Our guests were blown away by the beautiful venue, the warm atmosphere, and the seamless coordination. Every detail was taken care of, and we felt so well looked after. The team was incredible, professional, friendly, and attentive. On the day itself, they ensured everything ran smoothly, allowing us to truly enjoy every moment. A special mention goes to our amazing wedding coordinator Nina!"
V145,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We had our wedding on New Year's Eve 2024 at Brinsop, and it was more perfect that we could have ever hoped for. The venue itself is stunning, with beautiful spacious rooms which slept over 40 of our guests. Our coordinator, Nina, was incredible and so supportive on the day - she kept everything running so smoothly and everything went by without a glitch. The food and drink managers Mark and Amy did the most incredible job - nothing was ever too much, they were so attentive, and the chefs the most stunning meal after we gave them a fairly vague brief of 'curry'! We had the most perfect day and we're so incredibly grateful to Brinsop and the team."
V145,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,Brinsop Court is pure magic—an unforgettable venue with an incredible team!
V145,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We were lucky enough to have our wedding at Brinsop Court in December, and it was an absolutely spectacular day. We fell in love with Brinsop as soon we set our eyes on the beautiful manor and surrounding gardens. Cate, Amy, Mark and the rest of the wonderful staff at Brinsop really go the extra mile to make you feel special, and are extremely flexible with requests in order to make your day feel more special. We honestly felt like there was no request too big leading up to the day and they really made us feel extremely comfortable leading up to the day.
On the day, Cate and her team were well on hand to help us with setting up everything and she had everything under control when there were a few hiccups. The day itself was absolutely magical, and that wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for everyone at Brinsop working extremely hard to ensure that everything went to plan and as smoothly as it could.
Thank you to everyone at Brinsop for making us feel at ease and ensuring that our wedding was an amazing day."
V145,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Brinsop, the perfect wedding venue! We got married at Brinsop in December and I can honestly say it was everything we could have hoped for and more. We found out about the venue through Hitched and was one of only two venues that we visited but as soon as we got the house we knew it was the one. We fell in love with everything about it and it was fair to say that our guests agreed with us with many saying it was the nicest venue they’d been to. We had the wonderful Nina as our coordinator and she was brilliant! Nothing was too much trouble and we had constant communication with her in the build up which helped our stress levels no end. The same can be said for all of the staff who were brilliant throughout and allowed us to have the best day of our lives with everything running seamlessly. A special mention must be given to Amy and the catering staff who put on such an incredible menu (including the tasting session that provided some of the best food we’d ever had) and ensured that the food has been one of the main things that people have mentioned to us since the wedding! We had our ceremony in the Banqueting Hall which provided the perfect setting, especially with it being a winter wedding, as it really added to the cosy atmosphere and the lounge areas/games room were perfect for the drink’s reception. We would have loved to have also had it in the courtyard, but the temperatures meant that the lounge with the fireplace was a far more appealing option on the day. We then had the wedding breakfast and reception in the knot barn which was decorated beautifully and was the perfect place for the party in the evening. Overall we really can’t thank everyone at Brinsop enough for making our day what it was, we can honestly say that we have been made to feel part of the family and already can’t wait to hopefully come back to stay in one of the cottages for our first anniversary!"
V145,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Where do I start!!
Brinop Court is the most stunning venue, it was the first venue we visited and instantly fell in love! Theres so much history to the house and we were treated like family every time we visited before the wedding and it literally felt like home the whole weekend of the wedding, my guests also agreed!!

A special thank you to Issy our coodinator who went above and beyond ti make sure everything was perfect for us. It was so easy to plan and nothing was too much to ask, even arranging our dog to be our ring bearer!! When they say Brinsop is dog friendly they really mean it!!!

What a place, what a day!! Thank you so much everyone, you all made our day perfect and it really was the best day of our lives♥️"
V145,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We got married at the gorgeous Brinsop in October this year. It’s hard to put into words how amazing the whole experience was. We honestly had the best day of our lives!!!

We fell in love with Brinsop during our first visit back in December 2022. We knew almost immediately that Brinsop was the venue we were looking for! From the outside the venue looked like a painting - from the picturesque views of the countryside, to the swans swimming on the moat! The manor house itself has so much character, and has a lovely homely feel to it as you walk around it. Our guests were equally blown away by the venue!

A big thing for us was that it’s dog friendly, which meant we could have our two dogs join us on our special day, it wouldn’t have been the same without them there! They had so much fun walking around the grounds and greeting all of our guests!

Nina, our coordinator, and her team were always available to answer any of our questions in the run up to the day. This really put us at ease, knowing we were in safe hands. On the day, Nina and the team made sure everything ran smoothly and went above and beyond to ensure our guests were looked after. A shout out to Amy who heads up catering and Mark who manages the bar. The food and drinks were absolutely fantastic!

I highly recommend this venue! There’s a reason Brinsop is an award winning venue - and when you visit it’s not hard to see why. We are already looking forward to going back there for a date night next year! Thanks for everything Team Brinsop!

V146,The Manor at Bickley,"The Manor is the perfect venue for weddings! When our wedding venue fell through 4 months before the big day, I stumbled onto the Manor at Bickley and spoke to Craig. He was most helpful and kind and went above and beyond to make sure our wedding went ahead.

We hired the venue for our two day wedding and the staff were helpful and accommodating from start to finish. All of our guests were awed by the beautiful well kept grounds and the excellent service. We can’t thank the staff enough for making our wedding dreams a reality. They thought of every detail from bringing us champagne after our civil ceremony to making sure we had our card box at the end of the night! We are excited to head back to celebrate our anniversary there!"
V146,The Manor at Bickley,"Myself and my Husband chose this venue for our wedding last week and we can’t sing The Manor’s praises enough. From our very first enquiry, to the first viewing of the venue, right though until the big day, the staff at the manor have been nothing short of brilliant! Each staff member we came across was polite and accommodating. Special mention to Craig and Vicky with whom we did most of our liaising throughout the months leading up until our wedding. Craig and Vicky were super helpful, responsive and went above and beyond to make sure that we could have the day of our dreams. Even with last minute changes due to the weather, Craig who was just incredible throughout, managed to help us sort a backup plan so our day would still go ahead seamlessly.

The rooms at the manor were spacious and modern, giving us and our wedding party lots of space for photographers and videographers to capture the special moments on our wedding morning.

The lodge that was used for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready was fabulous. The manor was very flexible in giving us early access so we could get ready on time.

The grand marquee was definitely grand! Very spacious and when decorated looked like something out of a fairytale! lots of kitchen space, a huge bar and fantastic overhead speakers for the party!

The manor was super flexible to our needs regarding access, start times, outsourcing our vendors and much more. The venue is beautiful and spacious with options for outdoor and indoor events and entertainment. The grounds were absolutely beautiful, so many lovely spots for photos not only for us as the bride and groom but for guests too!

A very special thank you to our point of contact throughout, Craig. From our first meeting, he was charming, bubbly and made us feel super welcome. He reassured us that he has experience in African/Caribbean weddings and that our wedding day would amazing and it was. He was attentive and always let us know that he was only a phone call or e-mail away and was always quick to respond and answer any questions we had.

All in all, we had the most beautiful day at The manor and we would definitely recommend this venue for a wedding or other events.

V146,The Manor at Bickley,"We hired The Manor at Bickley for my daughters wedding. Got a brilliant service from the venue. Everything was set accordingly, as per floor plan. Our guests were loved the venue grounds/facilities and the overall wedding set up.
Thank you to everyone at Bickley."
V146,The Manor at Bickley,"A warm and friendly service from the very helpful staff, a feeling that it is your own house! The food was amazing and the atmosphere made us and our guests feel fantastic."
V147,Davenport House,We are so pleased we chose Davenport House for our wedding reception. Charley and the team were so helpful and thoughtful. Putting canapés behind the bar for us and making sure everything ran so smoothly. I am obsessed with the stunning house and grounds and it was absolutely perfect! Thank you so much for making our day so special!!
V147,Davenport House,"Davenport House is a STUNNING wedding venue so how could we not have it for our big day!?

The staff were exceptional! From the moment we booked through to our big day, we had an absolute blast and could not thank each member of staff enough! Special shout out to Jared (hopefully spelt right, haha!) who made sure we were fed, watered and ensured we took 5 minutes to ourselves every moment we could - Also even saved us slices of pie wedding cake before we went to bed!

Our guests have said they have never been to a wedding so spectacular, with the most amazing food and amazing staff so could not have been happier having Davenport as our venue! 🩷"
V147,Davenport House,"I just wanted to write to say a huge, enormous thank you to Charley and all the team at Davenport House. We still can’t believe how perfect our day was, and lots of our guests have told us it’s the best wedding they’ve ever been to. The team were all a huge part of making that happen. It was incredibly seamless and well planned on the day, meaning we genuinely didn’t have to think about a thing, except for enjoying ourselves. The day ran to schedule perfectly and even certain touches we didn’t know or expect to happen were planned by you and the team, which made the day even more special. Thank you so much for giving us our dream wedding day. We can’t wait to see the full set of pictures and the video now to relive it all!"
V147,Davenport House,"Without doubt the best day of our lives. From start to finish, Davenport has exceeded expectations. From the very first impression of the venue during the open day, the incredible food tasting evening, all the way through to the day itself, including the support and preparation leading up to it. It was really important to us to pick a venue that not only ticked the fairytale box, but also come with the complete support of a wedding planner, due to our busy jobs. We were lucky enough to have Charley as ours. She really took the time to listen and get to know us, to ensure the day was tailored to exactly what we wanted. We even had our own cocktail designed, which went down an absolute storm on the day! She considered every little detail, constantly putting our minds at ease, which made the whole process so easy and enjoyable. Honestly the day couldn’t have gone smoother, any anxiety or stress faded immediately as soon as we got to the venue. It was simply perfect. So many of our guests were complimentary of just how beautiful the venue is and just how well organised the day was, and that is the perfect way to summarise Davenport. Any prospective couples thinking of selecting Davenport as their venue, hesitate no further. It will be a day you never knew was possible! We cannot thank you enough Charley and the Davenport team, if only we could live the day over and over again"
V147,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was amazing. When looking for a venue we weren't just looking for something wow, we needed to have people who were enthused and passionate about their work - we found that at Davenport House.

From our first phone call & meeting with Lizzie and Tallulah, we knew this was the place for us. Having two brides wasn’t an issue; combining British, Asian and Spanish cultures - wasn't an issue; having brides enter together – wasn’t an issue. Nothing was an issue. At Davenport House, we got it all – a picturesque venue and the best team of staff anyone could ever wish for. All our external suppliers have commented what a fantastic venue you are. All out guests have said that the service and attention to detail was second to none. The thoughtful touches like hiring a Spanish speaking waiter for the table which spoke very little English ensured that everyone felt welcomed. Guests with dietary requirements didn't feel they got a second rate meal or they were an afterthought - the food for all throughout the day was exceptional. The rooms / cottages where our guests and we stayed, spotless and comfortable. The thought behind adding some cheese and Spanish ham to the morning breakfast - so sweet!

Special shout out to Megan - wedding planner extraordinaire who kept in touch throughout the planning process and was exceptional on the day. Ian who worked tirelessly to ensure the day ran smoothly and the food was perfect, Charley who was also in charge of one bride and ensuring that everything was on point. All the staff were fantastic - polite, professional and personal.

Everyone keeps saying that this was the best wedding they have ever attended and that’s a lot of weddings between people! When we asked why, they say things like ‘the venue’, ‘the staff’, but it all came back to the inclusivity, love & joy that they felt – and you were all a part of that.

Davenport House is a stunning venue made even better by those who work there. If you want the whole package on your wedding day, we strongly recommend you book them.

Thank you to the entire Davenport House team.

Sat and Ana xx"
V147,Davenport House,"Where to begin with our beautiful venue and thanking the people who made it all happen! We got married in November at Davenport House and it was easily the best day of our lives. We chose Davenport because we wanted to host our cosy winter wedding in a big grand house in the country, with all the grandeur and class but to still feel like an intimate celebration with our family and closest friends, and it was perfect in delivering just that. It is utterly beautiful, the location was perfect and exactly what we wanted. The food was absolutely AMAZING, we had so many compliments from our guests and we are so grateful for the team in delivering such a fabulous wedding breakfast. Thank you so much to Lizzie who couldn’t do more to help us have our dream day, and Ian who delivered the best service to us and our guests (the pizza at 2am was very much appreciated)

Massive massive thank you to Charley our wedding planner, who was so so helpful throughout our wedding planning process and on the day, I can’t thank her enough. She was always there whenever I needed her, helped me so much with creating our dream day and I will be forever grateful to her for keeping me sane! Whenever I had any worries I knew she was just a phone call away, which helped me a lot when planning a wedding!

Charley, Lizzie and Ian thank you for everything - best team ever. Our day was seamless and it was all down to you and your incredible team.

Jess and Sam xx"
V147,Davenport House,"Me and my (now) wife chose Davenport House as our wedding venue in mid 2022, to get married in September 2023, and it was the best decision we could have made. We looked at a range of Georgian style manor house type venues located in Cheshire, North Wales and the West Midlands areas. It blew all of the competition away in terms of the venue aesthetics, the balance in design (i.e. period characteristics vs modern design), the impressive condition of the property for its age plus what it offered for our wedding weekend.

Staff and service - In the UK, this is usually something that is average at best - if you're lucky. At Davenport House, the service from all staff was 10/10. I honestly don't think we've ever had better service for anything. We had a wedding planner from the start (Megan), who was an absolute saint and was fundamental in making the whole wedding a success. She was also instrumental in helping us find a way for our 'little' dog Bernie to be a part of the main event. Thanks Megan!

Accommodation - The fantastic condition, design and decor for Davenport House extends to all areas of the estate. The rooms are fantastic, very big, well maintained and cleaned religiously by the venue. We had no issues or problems from all of the guests who stayed onsite over the 3 days.

Food and drink - This got a lot of deserved praise from the guests too. We got to tailor our entire menu and it worked perfectly for what we wanted for the 3 days. The oyster bar and luxurious charcuterie board went down particularly well the day before the wedding.

I could keep writing much, much more on how fantastic this venue was for our wedding. But the best advice I could give for any interested couples is to go and visit it in person and reach out to Davenport House with any questions. Our own wedding ended up becoming both perfect and the best wedding we've ever been to. Thanks guys again!"
V147,Davenport House,"Fantastic location.
Great staff.
Beautiful place to get married.
I can wait to film here again soon thanks for having me."
V147,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was a fairytale, everything we could have dreamed of and more. Lizzie and Charley were fantastic in their support, organisation and professionalism in planning our wedding. The venue is simply spectacular- breathtaking. Our guests were blown away. The day ran so smoothly it was simply perfect. The food was out of this world our guests couldn't get enough. All the staff at the house went above and beyond to ensure we were happy and having a great day. The team were also extremely supportive of last minute changes/additions. The Davenport experience was truly wonderful and I'm sad to see it end right from our initial meetings, food tasting and finally our special day. Thank you: Lizzie, Charley, Ian and all of the team for a truly memorable day for us and our guests. Mr and Mrs Kissane"
V147,Davenport House,"We got married at Davenport House in February and they provided us with the most perfect day. Lizzie, Charley, Ian and the rest of the team were the best hosts we could have hoped for. Nothing was too much to ask and the guests all commented on the hospitality shown to them. The setting is utterly gorgeous, our weather was less than favourable so we did not make the most of the grounds but this didn't matter, the house was setting enough and so atmospheric! The food was utterly AMAZING and better than most restaurant food I have eaten. The venue feels intimate and grand at the same time.
I literally cannot recommend this place enough, they gave us the wedding we had always wanted and more!"

V149,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge on 12 May 2023 and it was incredible. The views are gorgeous and the photo opportunities are endless with beautiful floral and green surroundings. The team were super responsive throughout the process which is really reassuring and helpful when planning a wedding, and Nelson who ran the day was just fantastic. Every single detail was thought of and they run a really slick operation. This is essential as it meant I had a lot less to think about! They put me and my partner at ease throughout. The food and service on the day was fantastic, so many of our guests said this was the best food they’ve ever had at a wedding. Highly recommend! (Photos by Costa Weddings UK)"

Robert made sure everything ran perfectly and helped us to find slots in the busy wedding timetable to fit in some special moments to also reflect traditions from my husband's Dutch culture. The food was great and the staff were polite and fun. All preparation with Lucy was also smooth and done with a smile.

V149,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue than Pembroke Lodge for our summer wedding. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most gorgeous backdrop for our special day. A huge thank you to our banqueting manager, Nelson, who went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly.

The team was incredibly supportive and accommodating throughout the planning process, making it an enjoyable and stress-free experience.

V149,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We got married on the 3rd of October this year, and the team made our day magical! What a smooth day. We loved every second of it! The guests loved everything, and raved about the food and organisation.
Hiring Pembroke Lodge was easy. We had a viewing where all information was shared in detail and super clear to understand and make a decision.
On the months leading up to the big day our contact was Alice. Alice is a star. Responsive, professional, and had answers and solutions to everything.
On the day, Nelson coordinated the whole thing, minute by minute, and we are forever grateful for his politeness, professionalism and high spirits. We felt safe and in good hands. I would give Pembroke Lodge way over 5 stars if I could :)"
V149,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","My wedding went without a hitch, thanks to the amazing team at Pembroke Lodge (special thanks to Nicola & Robert)! They made sure everything was set up perfectly on the day, exactly in the way we had requested, and then ensured the day itself went as smoothly as we could've hoped. Everything looked beautiful and the stunning views made all of our guests fall in love with the venue too."
V149,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had the most perfect day. The team have all been so responsive and accommodating of our every request. The venue is beautiful and we were lucky to have gorgeous sunset views. It is truly a countryside wedding but conveniently close to London, which was important for our overseas guests. The food was fantastic and staff were professional and efficient. Would recommend to anyone."
V149,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We recently had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge, and I cannot say enough good things about the venue, the team and manager, Robert. From the moment we started planning to the big day itself, he was absolutely incredible.

Robert went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. He was always available to answer our questions, offer solutions, and provide creative suggestions that enhanced our vision. He coordinated effortlessly with our vendors, making sure everyone was on the same page, which took so much stress off our shoulders.

On the day of the wedding, he was a true rockstar! He made sure the timeline flowed perfectly, from setting up the ceremony space to ensuring the reception transitions were seamless. His dedication and hands-on approach allowed us to enjoy every moment without worrying about a single thing.

Our wedding was a dream come true, and we owe so much of that to him and the team! Thank you, for everything you all did to make our day magical."

The food was delicious and all the team was so welcoming and super helpful on the day.

Thank you so much, we really really appreciate all the help!"
V150,The Hackney,"If you are having a wedding for under 60 people then this is your place! From start to finish the communication and planning of the wedding was seamless and took so much of the stress out of the day. The totally customisable packages that they offer really does suit anyone’s budget and more importantly regardless of what package you end up going for it is value for money. The food was delicious and it catered to everyone’s tastes including a pregnant guest, halal, vegan and lactose intolerant and was the talking point for our guests. The venue itself is stunning! Lots of exposed brick, they had recently redecorated before our wedding and the reception room that doubled up as the dance floor was styled simply but made a statement and the outdoor covered patio area was a welcome addition. The team understood our vision from the get go and they completely nailed it, all of our guests couldn’t believe it was here! I honestly can’t recommend it enough if you’re wanting a small and intimate wedding venue but still with all the class. I would say to future couples even if you think this wouldn’t be your venue please please do have a proper look because it will change your mind, I had come across this venue multiple times over the course of a year and decided to take a leap of faith and give it a chance and we’re so happy we did."
V150,The Hackney,"We can’t recommend the Hackney highly enough. They made the whole process so easy and they offer so much in-house which we took advantage of. The food was especially great - our guests were amazed “best food I’ve ever had at a wedding” and the team took great care of us during the planning stages.

They offer a very customisable service with scalable pricing. If you’re having a fairly small wedding (under 60) then you must check out The Hackney.

We had such a perfect day and we owe so much of that to the fabulous venue. Beautiful space, so professionally run."
V150,The Hackney,"We had such a brilliant experience working with the team at The Hackney. We were regularly in touch throughout the planning process and the use of the shared spreadsheet was especially handy for keeping everyone informed.
We had to postpone our wedding two days before as we were both sick with COVID, and the team were just fantastic. They waited for us to recover and then we started to talk through options again. We were able to rebook just six months after our original date, and the team were accomodating and understanding throughout the process.
The day itself was perfect. Lots of our guests commented on the quality and quantity of the food and Hugo was great at keeping everything to time. We wish we could do it all again."
V150,The Hackney,"We had our wedding reception here and wow was it amazing. Hugo, Erika and the whole team were amazing. Every single guest commented on how delicious and plentiful the food was. The staff were amazing nothing was too much to ask and all so happy.
The venue itself was decorated amazingly, given we left our wedding stationary etc up to the venue it exceeded our expectations. I was concerned about the allowed decibel level for Dj / entertainment but it was plenty loud enough. I wish I could relive the day again, if you’re thinking about booking The Hackney do it! You will not regret!"
V150,The Hackney,"We held our wedding reception at The Hackney in July and it was truly the best experience. We opted for a standing reception for our 65 guests, serving food bowl-style for a more relaxed, less formal feel. The food was absolutely delicious and there was lots of it - it just kept coming! Our guests are still raving about how good the food was months later! Lots of good drinks options too - we especially like the cocktails here!

The staff on the night were so friendly, welcoming and were amazing with our children guests too!

The Hackney is such an aesthetic venue with exposed brick walls and existing foliage which we loved, so we kept additional decorations to a minimum. We dropped our decorations to The Hackney the day before and picked them up the day after, which was super easy! We hadn’t given them too much direction with where we wanted everything placed but when we turned up to the venue on the day it was truly perfect! The staff know exactly what they’re doing and had decorated it beautifully! The outdoor seating area is a great feature too (especially for our two greyhounds who chilled out there for the majority of the reception!)

We opted for a simple Spotify playlist for our music and their sound system was good.

The wedding planning process was super easy from start to finish, with continued support and check-ins from Hugo, from the moment we booked, to the day itself! We really enjoyed the menu tasting experience earlier in the year too, which is a great touch in the build up to the big day! The planning spreadsheet was easy to use and made us feel content and relaxed, knowing that everything was under control.

Overall, we would highly recommend The Hackney to anyone looking for an affordable, dog-friendly, wedding reception venue with a laidback vibe, delicious food and lovely friendly staff! We look forward to coming back every year to celebrate our anniversary, with an espresso martini!"
V150,The Hackney,"We hosted our wedding reception with the team at the hackney in May 2023. The planning experience was straight forward and easy to book. The availability for the venue is on the website so easy to see when they have and get it booked. We went with the 5 canapés, bowl food menu, and drinks on arrival with wine through the event. The staff were brilliant and food delicious.

We loved the vibe of the venue as we wanted a bit more of a casual event, with a relaxed feel and we were able to host our 85 guests with no issues (although limited to standing event at this size, there is enough scattered seating for anyone to sit when they wanted).

In terms of decorating, we didn't feel the need to add any extra flowers as the venue was already so made up with plants and other decorations.

We did add the photo box which I highly recommend, was great fun for our friends and family and came with a memory book. People were shy at first but really got into it. We also used the recommended baker who provided a delicious cake.

Final area to mention - pricing. Wedding venues can be really expensive and daunting before you even start paying for any food or drink. Something that really attracted us to this venue was the low spacing cost and the minimum spend with it. It meant that we were able to completely customise the experience and see where the money we were spending was going. There are many different options and packages to go with, so it's up to you.

Only thing that wasn't offered was any tasting of the food beforehand which we would've liked to have done but none the less, the food was delicious so it wasn't really needed!

To finish, we loved every moment of it and hope that many others get to experience the same. Thank you very much team at the hackney!"
V150,The Hackney,"We had our reception in July. The venue was cosy and comfortably fit 30 people without feeling too crowded or too empty (we were worried it might be too empty). We managed to fit a band in, arranged mini-golf in the venue after dinner, and customize the cocktail menu with custom recipe (that we provided before hand).

One of the biggest highlights was the food. The crispy roast pork got so many complements and indeed it was tasty. But really, all the dishes were amazing (we had a tasting session prior), it was hard to choose, but the taste of each dish was still top notch on the day itself too. I heard that the supper snacks we ordered were great too but alas, I was too busy and they were snapped up instantly!

Some other details:
* We were allowed to use the small room downstairs as a private space to put our stuff. Very handy to not mess up items.
* We went with a bar tab and kept increasing the budget each time till the end of the night instead of the all-you-can-drink. From our rough calculations, it worked out about the same going for all-you-can-drink. Of course, certain folk were heavy weights and more than made it up will be different for each crowd.
* Lighting for photos came out excellent (combination of photographer and venue lighting).
* You can adjust air conditioning to suit the weather (we had ours on the warm side due to older folk not dealing with cold too well).
* Outdoor space was a pleasant change in atmosphere for those who wanted some fresh air.

What about the review from the Bride? Bride approved this review."
V150,The Hackney,"The day was fabulous - Hugo was brilliant and flexible with what we were after. The tasting day before was such a great idea and the whole experience and guidance given made planning a wedding in c.5 months so much easier. We had vegans, last minute drop outs, ridiculously hot weather, about 3 different spotify playlists, a string quartet, florists arriving in the morning and a cake that arrived the day before - the team took it all in their stride and it seemed like a breeze. Loved it all and we've had such good feedback from guests. A fabulous whirlwind.

Two very minor points for feedback - we maxed out the guest numbers (the team did advise us against it but were very accommodating despite us also throwing musicians into the mix) and it was a little too crowded pre-lunch on such a hot day. We also put some speeches in between courses (again, we were recommended against it) and that may have been a slight mistake for the dessert timings, as the tasting day was 10/10. But, it was a perfect day in a stunning venue. Loved it - thank you guys."
V150,The Hackney,"Jon and the team were absolute superstars, hosting the perfect wedding day for us. The space is beautiful, the decor is modern and perfect. They were so accommodating for any request or question we had which we really appreciated. Guests commented on how great the cocktails were! The day ran so smoothly and we had a fantastic time."
V150,The Hackney,"From the initial phonecall to the warm welcome we got when we first visited The Hackney, we knew we were in safe hands and that we’d made the perfect choice. The venue offers the most beautiful interiors - the perfect mix of cosy, intimate and modern industrial - exactly what we were looking for!

Our entire experience with The Hackney was an absolute dream -we loved the mega organised approach to planning. Something that could have been incredibly intimidating was made so straightforward with the amazing support of Hugo the General Manager who embraced all our weird and wonderful suggestions and gave expert advice on what we could do to make things even better. We left every meeting buzzing with ideas and even more excited to welcome our closest friends and family to the big day.

The quality of the food and drinks is impeccable - every single one of our guests (even the fussiest!) has commented on how much they loved it. We absolutely loved the menu tasting, even though it made the decision even harder as everything was amazing. What makes it even better for us is living close by and being able to pop into our wedding venue for a coffee or a cocktail!

I couldn't recommend The Hackney enough - I just wish we could go back and do it all again!"
V151,PYRÁ,"We held our wedding reception at Pyra. We booked the entire venue, with the upstairs loft serving as a dance floor with bar and downstairs having tables and seating for guests.  Canapes were served upstairs and a buffet dinner was served downstairs.  We lucked out with great April weather, so guests were also able to enjoy Pyra’s patio and additional space on Lonsdale Road. We were very happy with our decision to have our reception at Pyra, and many of our guests commented on how lovely the space was, how nice the staff were, and how delicious the food was.
 
The venue:
The space is gorgeous with lots of natural light upstairs.  Guests arrived at 4pm but we had the venue for the entire day, and Pyra gave our florist access earlier to set up beautiful flower arrangements and candles - it looked stunning.  Pyra set up our welcome sign and card box too. The venue also accepted delivery of our cake on the morning of the wedding which was a huge help, set it up very nicely upstairs, and cut it for us after the formal “cake cutting” shots.  We were able to coordinate with Pyra ahead of time to arrange the space how we wanted, such as how many tables we wanted downstairs and the set-up of the loft upstairs.  They even had a microphone ready for us upstairs so we could say a few words to our guests before our cake cutting. Perfect! For the evening dancing, we were able to set the disco lighting to our colour scheme, which worked really well with candles and foliage (latter 2 provided by our florist).
 
The food:
The buffet dinner was fantastic.  Pyra gave us multiple menu items to choose from and we were able to fix a nice menu that took into account guests’ dietary restrictions.  We initially booked the venue when it had a different chef and menu.  We came in a few months before our wedding to try the new menu – our dinner was delicious then and there was no dip in quality for the buffet-style served at our reception. Fionn worked with us how to plan best - because we wanted a relaxed style with a dance floor upstairs, we ended up feeding our 80 guests in two sittings downstairs, which worked perfectly. The upstairs space can seat 60 people, which didn’t work for how we planned our event, but does look really nice in photos. The late night food served around 10pm also went down very well.
 
The staff:
The staff, including the bartenders and waiters, were hardworking, friendly and very nice to guests.  Enough staff were around that guests never had to wait long for drinks.  Members of staff cut our cake for us and also boxed up the late night food for guests to bring home.  Fionn, the day-of coordinator, was on-site for our entire reception and was very helpful, even helping coordinate our midnight bus arrival.
 
Responsiveness:
Overall we were happy with the responsiveness of the venue.  It took a little while to nail down the final details of the food menu and drinks menu/bar tab but we were ultimately very happy with the result.  As the venue hosts more weddings/ larger-scale events we’d expect this will improve.

Overall:
We highly recommend Pyra for a wedding reception. We had 80 guests in total, which worked very well for the canapes/cocktail hour upstairs (4-6pm), sit-down buffet downstairs (6-8pm, split into two seatings) and dancing upstairs (8pm-midnight).  The upstairs loft was able to fit all 80 guests plus a four-piece band.  Lonsdale Road is also a charming street that provided great photo opportunities.  We looked into several other venues, and came away happy with Pyra's quote – we were able to book the venue, food (including canapes, dinner and late night food) and a generous bar tab for roughly the amount some other London venues were charging for just their space (no food or drink included). We and our guests had a fantastic time. Thanks so much to Fionn and the Pyra team :)"
V151,PYRÁ,"We had our wedding celebration at Lula. We booked the loft and restaurant for this.

Positives:
The venue is beautiful and needs minimal decoration.
The food was amazing; the chef is truly professional and everyone loved it.
They redecorated the restaurant section and added a set of couches to make it a lounge, which was beautiful.
The staff was very hardworking, professional, and lovely.

They provided us with a lounge, a wedding breakfast space and a dance floor.

Flexibility with Cake:
The bakery was scheduled to deliver and set up the cake at 16:45, but they delivered it at 09:45 instead. The Lula team handled the situation professionally by storing the cake and setting it up at the correct time. They presented the cake beautifully and assisted in cutting it into nice pieces. It could not have been more perfect.


The list of available drinks was huge, and they were happy to make custom drinks and bring in different juices if requested in advance. The event manager tried to accommodate every wish we had, and on the day we could not have hoped for more. Most of our guests said it was one of the best weddings and most beautiful venues they had ever been to.

Negatives:
Food tasting for the wedding menu was not included, which we had assumed would be, but it was given at a 50% discount. We had to sort out the floral decoration last minute, as they had initially suggested they would arrange it for us after providing a budget, but later said we needed to find our own. At times, they were a bit slow to respond, which made us anxious, but after communicating with them, this was resolved, and communication was very swift.

In conclusion:
Lula gave us the most beautiful wedding we could have dreamt of. We highly recommend them. The venue, the food, the service were amazing, and we could not have hoped for more."
V152,Sandon Manor,"We had such a special wedding at Sandon Manor, the team made every effort to make our day so so special and we will be forever grateful for that. A dream team! The day ran so smoothly and they worked so hard. The venue is unique with lots of different spaces which unfold throughout the day, which was perfect as our wedding fell on a wet and windy autumnal day. We would highly recommend Sandon Manor!"
V152,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor provided the perfect venue for our wedding. From the initial conversations and meetings with the team, we knew we were in safe hands and had made the right choice. They kept us informed with any events, made information a bit payments clear and reassured us with any query we had.
The accommodation was exceptional and fitted our requirements perfectly, with high quality finishing touches throughout to ensure our stay was as comfortable as possible.
The wedding venue was incredible! Our ceremony took place in the gorgeously modern barn with stunning draping and greenery. Following on, we had a blissful drinks reception which was on the expertly manicured lawn (with mini golf!) and sun-trap of a courtyard. We then moved onto our wedding breakfast which was held in the main barn, seating all of our guests comfortably with space for decor and extra details. Following from dinner, the part started and the club room came to life! This was absolutely the talking point of the day and our guests raved about how incredible it was! It managed to create a club-like atmosphere, whilst maintaining the vibe, albeit at a reduced volume, in the rest of the barn. The layout of the venue was important to us, as it ensured our guests never strayed too far, to keep the momentum of the day.
The team at Sandon worked superbly with all of vendors which ensured the day ran smoothly from set up to clearing. All of our vendors commented on how much they too loved working there.
The venue, the aesthetics, the staff, everything was perfect! We would absolutely recommend to anyone getting married."
V152,Sandon Manor,"We cannot recommend Sandon Manor enough. From the quality of the service, the helpfulness and friendliness of the team, the beautiful accommodation and the most amazing venue which all or guests loved partying the night away in. To make it even more special the Manor is in amazing grounds in beautiful countryside and nature reserves.
Sandon Manor made our dream come true."
V152,Sandon Manor,"I couldn't recommend Sandon Manor highly enough - from our first enquiry to our Wedding, nothing was too much trouble. The team are so friendly and easy to communicate with, very approachable and responsive. They respond to any questions immediately and having the day before to set up with Tom was fantastic. Styaying in the Manor House and Dovecote was the icing on the cake as to be with friends and family the night before and the day after was so fabulous. On the day Tom and the team were absolutely fantastic and couldn't have done more to make our special day. We couldn't have dreamt of anywhere more perfect than Sandon Manor - a huge thank you to all the staff."
V152,Sandon Manor,"If you are considering Sandon Manor for your wedding venue, I beg you: scratch it off your list now. Yes, the house and grounds are beautiful, but the people behind it are absolutely awful. They ruined our wedding experience.

I will get straight to it. Sandon Manor has a very strict policy on guests leaving the site by 11:30pm (and no one is allowed back to the Manor unless they’re official guests staying overnight). We had lots of international guests at our wedding. Many hadn’t seen each other in years and would be jetlagged - we thought they may be keen to continue chatting after 11:30pm. With this in mind, we made a booking with Sandon Village Hall via our contacts at the church (where we were attending services and later married). They granted us access to the village hall until 1am as a contingency spill over space.

We mentioned this in passing during our online meeting with one of the Sandon Manor team a month before our wedding. Within hours, I received a voicemail from the lady in charge of Village Hall bookings saying (quote) “someone at Sandon Manor is trying to throw a spanner into the works for you”. It soon transpired that they had raised an official complaint to the parish council and pressurised the village hall team into cancelling our booking. To be clear, Sandon village Hall and Sandon Manor are entirely separate entities – there is no crossover between them whatsoever, as the owner of Sandon Manor later acknowledged.

It gets worse. Gob smacked, we asked Kate – the owner of Sandon Manor – for a call to find out what was going on. She was abhorrent, trying to justify her meddling as a necessary measure to protect her wedding license (side note: with Sandon Manor it is always about the money – once your deposit is paid they care nothing for your ‘special day’; you are just another cash cow). Did she apologise for stabbing us, her clients, in the back? No, she did not. She could not even fathom how hurt we were by being completely bypassed in the communication chain and how deceitful and disrespectful this was. My husband and I were quite literally left speechless. We’ve never experienced this sort of treatment from anyone, let alone our wedding venue - to whom we were paying many thousands of pounds. Dealing with this stress in the final month of wedding prep really took its toll on us and soured things. We no longer looked forward to our day, rather dreaded what Sandon Manor might do next.

Aside from this major incident, there were many other occasions when Sandon Manor were unhelpful and unfeeling in their interactions with us:

- We enquired if it would be possible to arrange a large pizza takeaway order instead of using Sandon Manor’s caterer for our late night food. One of the team explained on a call that this wasn’t contractually possible; we acknowledged this. We then received an email saying ‘If you are unable to follow this or any other of our T&C's we would be happy to cancel your booking.’ This was less than a month before our wedding.
- We had a harpist perform in the church. We were told she wasn’t allowed to play during our drinks reception in the grounds due to potential noise complaints (an acoustic harp at 2pm in the afternoon). No other music was permitted outside the house.
- Sandon Manor is an incredibly expensive (in hindsight, grossly overpriced) venue. But we were also hit with hidden fees when booking their accommodation option - an extra £425 ‘cleaning fee’ was added to our bill.
- At the time of booking, Sandon was running a promotion waivering the £700 fee for hiring their ceremony space. As we were marrying at the church, we asked if it would please be possible to put this towards other elements of our day i.e. using their festoon string of lights in the barn (for which they charge £450). They refused.
- We were unsure about booking the 1-bed Dovecote on the grounds as - at £499 for the weekend - it was a considerable expense. While we were deciding Sandon Manor rented it out on Air BnB (to one of our guests, which made for a very awkward conversation).

To summarise, you only get one wedding day. Kate and her team absolutely ruined ours. There are so many other lovely venues in north Hertfordshire run by decent, humane people. Please prioritise your happiness and choose wisely. I wish we had."
V152,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor is a stunning wedding venue with a great team behind it. The exclusive use of the manor for the weekend was a highlight, allowing us to relax with friends and family in the lead up to and after the big day. The Sandon team were brilliant, guiding us through the planning process and ensuring everything ran smoothly on the day. We couldn't have asked for a better place and team to help us celebrate our big day."
V152,Sandon Manor,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our special day. Holly, Tom and the rest of the brilliant team made us feel welcome from day one. Special mention to Tom for making the day run so seamlessly, so professional and accommodating of all our needs.

The venue itself is stunning, located in the beautiful Hertfordshire countryside. The Manor House makes for a tremendous location to prepare, and the Dovecote suite is a nice touch: a great addition for the groom to spend the last night. We loved the small details of the characteristic main venue, with the botanical feel to the bar a great backdrop to the barn.

It’s a shame we can’t stay every week!

Dan & Suzanne"
V152,Sandon Manor,"To Holly, Louise, Tom & Kate, wow, what can we say but the biggest thank you for the best day of our lives! When we viewed the beautiful venue over two years ago we just knew instantly Sandon Manor was the one, not just because it’s stunning, but you guys are amazing! Thank you for making all our wedding dreams come true. Forever grateful and can’t wait to return to reminisce. Lots of love, the new Mr & Mrs Jakes xxx"
V152,Sandon Manor,"From the moment we visited Sandon Manor we knew this would be our wedding venue for 9 September 2023. Seeing the spectacular finish of the house carry through to the completed venue just shows the high level of attention to detail this venue had to offer.

Holly, Tom and the rest of the team filled us with confidence right from our first interactions, annd went above and beyond on the wedding weekend itself to facilitate us, our suppliers and guests. The main house, dovecote, annex and extensive grounds were a wonderful way to have close family stay with us on site, and so handy to be able to all get ready nearby the morning of.

Thank you for making our wedding weekend a truly memorable occasion, for us and our families. We all look back on this day with the happiest, sunniest memories and Sandon Manor will always have a very special place in our hearts."
V152,Sandon Manor,"We had the most amazing wedding weekend at Sandon Manor.

The venue itself is the perfect backdrop for a wedding, our photos looked amazing from every single angle. There were so many spaces to make use of throughout the day which helped things to run incredibly smoothly and meant we didn’t need to have a ‘turnaround’ during the evening. The spaces really wowed our guests and created such a lovely atmosphere. Including the ‘club room’ dance floor that had our guests dancing until the very last song!

We stayed at the Manor House for the weekend, extending our wedding into a perfect weekend retreat. The house itself is beautiful, with lots of different areas for everyone to relax, and the perfect peaceful location to chill the night before the big day!

From our first viewing to checking out the day after our wedding, the Sandon staff were attentive, friendly and helped us feel relaxed and looked after throughout an otherwise overwhelming process. We’d highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for a beautiful, peaceful and unique wedding venue!"
V153,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Thank you so much to the entire team for making our wedding so special! Thanks to Donique, MJ, Mo, Harry and everyone else for helping us organise our day and for their professional but friendly attitude. Merchant Taylors is such a beautiful venue and offers a brilliant layout and different spaces to make the day so special!"
V153,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you all so very much for such an amazing wedding on Saturday. You all worked tirelessly to make it so special. Everything was truly wonderful and you all did me proud! Both Hugh and I couldn’t have asked for anything more in terms of being so well looked after. Our guests were so impressed and have given us so many compliments on a brilliantly well run event. Thank you all again for playing a brilliant part in our truly wonderful day of which we loved every minute
V153,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you so much for the most wonderful wedding reception at the end of April. We had the perfect day and our guests all commented on how well looked after they has been. Thank you again for all your hard work!
V153,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"We know this is very late (we have no excuse), but we wanted to say thank you for everything you and the team at Merchant Taylor's did for us on our wedding day. All the guests have since told us how much they loved the venue, food and service. Fingers crossed you get a few couples getting in touch! Again, Thank You for everything!"
V153,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"My brother and I attended the wedding today, as Florist's for the wedding party.
We were treated fantastically well by ALL the staff that we met, nothing was too much trouble and they made our task a COMPLETE pleasure.
If this is how they treat the actual wedding party then you will have a unforgettable time. Many thanks to all the staff for helping us to do our job with ease ."
V153,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Zara,

Can we thank you and your team at Merchant Taylor’s Hall for all your hard work in making Caroline and Neil’s recent wedding so very special. You, in particular, were able to deal with every question and request in a really professional manner.

Merchant Taylors’ Hall is part of the rich panoply of history and tradition, which makes this great City. All of our guests, and in particular those from abroad, were totally spell bound by the atmosphere, the food and service.

James was superb in organising the whole operation. To turn the Great Hall from a wedding ceremony hall to a banqueting suite for 110 guests, including flowers, place settings and dance floor in ninety minutes was truly remarkable.

The food and wine was of an amazing standard, we know that Merchant Taylors’ Hall has a reputation for presenting some of the finest dining in the City of London. You certainly surpassed all expectations.

We have many wonderful memories of the 10th September 2016, but it is best summed up by our daughter Caroline, “Can we do it all over again?”."
V154,Garden Museum,I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate everything that you did to make our party such a success last Friday. It was brilliant being outside on such a lovely everning. Everyone was very impressed with the venue.
V154,Garden Museum,"Thank you for all your help, advice and on-the-day support, it really made our wedding very special and it certianly went off without a hitch! The Museum looked amazing and the garden was perfect, especially as the sunshine adn the guests wanted to make the most of the beautiful surroundings."
V155,Clearwell Castle,"Can’t tell you how wonderful the team were at Clearwell. Our wedding coordinator Phaedra was exceptional. Attention to detail and everyone of the team from front of house, waiting staff, groundsmen and the DJ made our day absolutely everything we dreamed of and unique to us.

Can’t recommend highly enough and cost was outstanding value for money.

So many our guest commented on the quality of the food and that it was the best wedding they had been too! The children loved the magic of the castle and opportunity to get outside and see the grounds.

The grooms family had a fabulous time staying in the cottages the night before and our guests at both the Castle & the Wyndham had a fabulous stay on the night of the wedding.

Wish we could do it all again!"
V155,Clearwell Castle,We had our wedding at Clearwell in June and we couldn’t recommend it highly enough. From start to finish everything was perfect and they went above and beyond to ensure we had an amazing day. I’d not hesitate in recommending them to any couples. Just a gorgeous place with staff that really care in making your day all that you hope it will be.
V155,Clearwell Castle,"From the moment we first visited Clearwell, we knew this was the venue for us. From the moment we started planning to the final touches on the day, all the staff were fantastic. Ann, our wedding coordinator, was a delight to work with throughout. Nothing was too much trouble and she kept us updated throughout. The day was tailored exactly to our needs and when we arrived at the venue on the day they had prepared everything perfectly.

We did the night before package which included rooms and food the evening before. We were supplied with so much food no one went hungry. The rooms in the Wyndham and the Castle are fantastically appointed.

The venue itself is gorgeous. The cellar bar downstairs adds a whole different dimension to the occasion where you can really let your hair down.

This was an absolute dream come true venue for us. We loved every single minute."
V155,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot fault this venue at all. We initially had to change our wedding date because of lockdown and they were so supportive and empathetic.
Ann, our coordinator, is quite possibly the loveliest person on the planet. She was always happy to answer any questions and it never felt like we were being a nuisances or asking a silly question.
On the morning of the wedding she was a lovely calm presence and the whole day just ran like clockwork.
The food was out of this world with many guests saying it was the best food they’d had at a wedding and one person actually thought we’d hired a Michellin Chef!
The venue is so so beautiful with plenty of space. The downstairs cellar was a great place to party the night away, it was like an exclusive nightclub. There were lots of quieter rooms for people who wanted some peace.
The DJ was brilliant, we forgot to give a list of songs we liked but he did a great job of guessing what we liked ( he must’ve looked at our age and figured nineties dance music was our era. And he was bang on the money)
I do not have a single complaint about this venue"
V155,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot speak highly enough about Clearwell Castle as a wedding venue. The venue itself is absolutely stunning. It rained on our wedding day but the indoor space was so vast and beautiful that ourselves and our guests still had the most amazing time! Our wedding co-ordinator, Phaedra, was absolutely incredible, both before and during the wedding. She was always so professional, replied to all of my emails (there were many) and answered all queries efficiently. On the day, we genuinely could not have managed without her. The day flowed so well with her guidance and it really helped me as the Bride as I felt I didn't need to worry about anything! All the other staff at Clearwell and at the Wyndham hotel were also so wonderful! Everyone worked so hard and every member of staff was so kind to us; it just made our day incredibly special and we are so appreciative to them all. The food was great, service very quick and all the guests really enjoyed it! We had so many compliments about the staff and venue! I honestly could not recommend Clearwell castle more as a wedding venue!"
V155,Clearwell Castle,"Our wedding on 10/11/23 was just the absolute perfect day from start to finish. Our wedding planner manager, Hannah, was incredible, not just on the day but throughout the whole planning process. She ensured everything ran smoothly on the day, sparing no details ensuring everything was just perfect and to time but without being stressful. She was very accommodating with the planning meetings working around both mine and my now Husband's shift patterns.
We both stayed the night before our wedding and the night of the wedding with many of our guests travelling a distance so also staying in the Wyndham which was very convenient. Staying in Keepers cottage with the Bridesmaids the night before added to the experience with the added feature of the hot tub, the groomsmen were very jealous. The beds were very comfortable and everyone was excited to stay in a castle.
On the day of the wedding, the staff were very accommodating moving the bridal party along to the bridal suite to finish preparations earlier than originally planned. The breakfast provided was the perfect amount for a busy morning getting ready. Everything, including the gardens, were immaculately kept adding to the WOW factor of getting married in a Castle.
The canapes served and welcome drinks were well received by the guests and ourselves whilst we had photographers prior to the wedding breakfast. The food was phenomenal and great portions and I was stuffed after. The staff were very accommodating for us with a lot of people with allergies, dislikes of mushrooms so adapting the menu for these individual people. We were even able to swap out a few bottles of wine included in our package for cocktails as us as the Bride and Groom did not drink wine.
As soon as we walked in the venue the first time, we knew it was the place we wanted to get married. Everytime we went back to view the venue again I fell more and more in love. For anyone thinking about viewing or even booking this incredible venue I would say do it! We will be going back for events in the future to relive the best day of our lives."
V155,Clearwell Castle,"We got married at Clearwell castle April 2023. What can I say it's the most perfect venue and we had the most amazing day. The organisation was amazing and the staff were great on the day and even leading up to the big day. Phaedra was our wedding planner and communication with her was great throughout and on our wedding day she ensured that it all ran smoothly. I cannot recommend Clearwell castle and their staff enough. Thank you again for helping us have our dream wedding.
Kind regards

Vanessa & David x"
V155,Clearwell Castle,"We had the most amazing wedding day on the 24th of November 2023, the whole day ran so smoothly and all our guests absolutely loved the venue. The food was amazing and our guests loved the fish and chip buffet in the evening! The whole progress of planning the wedding was so straight forward and Phedera was a great wedding manager."
V155,Clearwell Castle,"Clearwell Castle exceeded all our expectations for our wedding day. The moment we stepped onto the grounds, we were captivated by its timeless charm. The staff, especially Hannah, went above and beyond to make every detail perfect, ensuring a seamless and stress-free experience. The Ball Room, where we exchanged our vows, felt like something out of a storybook. The surrounding gardens provided a stunning backdrop for photos and added to the overall enchantment of the day. Our guests were equally impressed, and many commented on the unique and romantic atmosphere. Choosing Clearwell Castle was the best decision we made for our special day; it truly felt like a fairy-tale come to life."
V155,Clearwell Castle,"We had the perfect wedding at Clearwell Castle, their team were superb in providing planning assistance from the point of our booking, guidance on all aspects of our wedding choices from registrars and suppliers, and coordination on the day of the wedding to make sure it flowed seamlessly. It was a beautiful day, and we couldn't be happier with our choice of Wedding location."
V156,Inner Temple,We got married here in 2023. Everything was perfect and the team made sure the day/food etc was just as we wanted it. Particular thanks to Priya and Eva (Pegasus) for their hard work making our wedding day and lead up so special.
V157,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"I got married at Dodford Manor in February this year. A great time was had by all and I will be recommending the venue to any friends planning weddings.

The weather was bad on the day so we didn’t get to use the outside area very much, but it didn’t matter as the inside is so lovely.

Sky was really helpful and put me at ease on the day. Questions in the lead up and on the day were answered quickly and I was made to feel like the only bride in the world!"
V157,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford was the first venue we looked at shortly after we got engaged. The staff were friendly and relaxed when we had a tour, I knew it was the place for us! I think Lydia telling my now husband that we couldn’t have fireworks due to the animals nearby but we could have a fire performer outside, sold the deal for us! I got an amazing fire performer as a surprise for my husband and the guests after we had sparklers, and it just completed an amazing day!
We heard such positive things Dodford about how professional and smooth running weddings have been from our suppliers, and you guys didn’t disappoint. You handled the day so well, we didn’t worry about a thing and just enjoyed ourselves the whole day.
We honestly had so many lovely messages and conversations after our wedding about how the venue was amazing, everything and everyone was catered for, from my 88 year old Nan, to young children who could play and enjoy the outdoors with a scoop of amazing ice cream. We honestly couldn’t have asked for a better day, we would do it again in a heartbeat if we could! Thank you for making the day so seamless! We are eternally grateful to everyone at Dodford for making our dreams come true becoming Mr and Mrs Price!"
V157,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford Manor what an incredible venue, from initial enquiry to booking, Dodford and the staff were so accommodating and well organised. Nothing was ever too much trouble, even if emails were being sent at 11pm. The day itself, wow it was absolutely incredible, as our wedding was on a budget and due to small numbers Dodford were amazing at setting out our decorations, everything was absolutely perfect and a special shout out to Kayleigh who was amazing on our wedding day. She kept us on time, always checking we were okay and just such a lovely person and really made our day perfect. Would highly recommend a Dodford to any couple due to be married they make the planning and the day an absolute dream and we want to relive it over again."
V157,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"It goes without saying that Dodford is a fab venue.... stunning set up, well maintained, clean, perfect grounds etc... but the best thing about Dodford is the team! I had super high expectations of any wedding venue I booked as I used to run a wedding venue myself (potential nightmare client 😂).... from the 1st viewing the team were fantastic. Relaxed, stress free, organised, professional, knowledgeable, flexible but mostly importantly friendly which gave me complete confidence in them delivering my perfect day.
In the run up to the big day the team are super responsive on email and phone We didn't meet our Event Manager, Lydia, until the day but I was always confident that they work as a whole team and therefore having 1 point of contact was not necessary at all.
In the day Lydia was amazing! Still relaxed and professional and the whole day ran so smoothly. Every requirement was perfect, on time, delivered exceptionally.
We had the best day, thank you to the whole team (especially Lydia!)

V157,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We honestly can’t say thank you enough for how amazing Dodford Manor Barn was, along with all the incredible staff who helped make our day truly unforgettable.

From the moment we visited, we fell in love with the beautiful landscapes, open-plan barns, and stunning large windows that flooded the space with natural light. The venue package was one of the best we saw during our search—it felt like everything we could possibly need was covered.

The team at Dodford Manor Barn were incredibly friendly and supportive throughout the entire planning process. Communication was open and consistent, which made everything feel so much more manageable and stress-free. We were even able to find all of our wonderful vendors through Dodford Manor Barn, which was a huge bonus!

As a bride who suffers from anxiety, I was unwell on the morning of the wedding. But I have to give special thanks to Kayleigh and our vendors, who were absolutely amazing and supported me through every step—they helped me feel calm, cared for, and ready to enjoy the day.

Our guests couldn’t stop talking about how stunning the venue was and how lovely the food turned out. We were also lucky enough to have sunshine all day, topped off with a beautiful sunset in the evening—it truly felt magical.

Thank you again, Dodford Manor Barn, for being such a perfect place to start our next chapter.

With love,
Carter & Emmie (24.03.2025) x"
V157,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"From the moment we booked our wedding at Dodford Manor, we knew we were in good hands—but nothing could have prepared us for just how extraordinary the experience would be. Every single detail was handled with such precision, care, and genuine warmth that it truly felt like a dream come to life.

The venue itself is breathtaking, but what made our day unforgettable was the impeccable service. The entire team operated like a well-oiled machine, making sure everything ran smoothly while keeping the atmosphere joyful and stress-free. Their attention to detail was second to none—no request was too big or too small.

We want to give a heartfelt, special shoutout to *Lydia*, our incredible Wedding Manager. From our first meeting to the final dance, she was nothing short of amazing. Lydia went above and beyond at every turn—anticipating needs before we even voiced them, coordinating flawlessly with suppliers, and offering support with a calming confidence that put us completely at ease, (apart from making me cry the second I saw her! 😂). Her passion for what she does shone through in every interaction, and our day would not have been the same without her.

Thanks to this amazing venue and its phenomenal team (especially Lydia!), we were able to truly enjoy every moment of our wedding, knowing everything was in the best possible hands. If you're considering this venue for your big day—don’t hesitate. It’s everything you hope for, and more.

We want to do it over and over!
A day we will NEVER forget!!

Thank you again and all our Love,
Mr & Mr Pargeter-Prince
Rowan & Karl xx"
V157,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We booked Dodford Manor in Feb 2024 after we viewed the space, for our wedding in March 2025. It was the only venue we viewed, but instantly fell in love with the character and variety of spaces the venue had to offer. The free corkage also really appealed to us as a great way for us to bring our own drinks at a good cost.

From start to end, the team were amazing, helping us with the planning of the day and making sure we had a great array of suppliers we could work with. The live band was a huge part of our day, and Dodford have a great mixture of acts on their supplier list.

On the day of the wedding, the groomsmen arrived at the venue to help with set up to see that our amazing event manager, Kayleigh had every single aspect of the day in hand and sorted. She sorted all table settings, decor, stationary - Everything!! Nothing was too much to ask of her and the Dodford team. The day ran impeccably well, with everything being on time and everything we asked for being sorted. Our drinks were served chilled, on time and were always around. It’s easy for venues who offer free corkage to try and limit you drinking your own drink - Not here!! There was constantly beers being topped up, wine bottles replaced and aperol spritz being taken round. Cannot fault them!

The team packed all of our bits away and ready for us to collect the next morning. We are very aware Dodford is a busy venue and wanted to make sure we wasn’t just “another wedding” but at no point was that the case. We felt like we were the one and only wedding and genuinely could not ask for more!

Thank you so so much for everything, Highly recommended!!"
V157,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We got married her a month ago today and had the most amazing day with them. Jess, Jack and the team made sure that everything ran smoothly and that they were doing everything they could for us on the day. We would 100% recommend them for anyone wishing to marry in such a beautiful setting."
V157,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We had been apprehensive booking Dodford for our reception that it was so popular in Northamptonshire that our wedding could end up looking the same as a lot of others we knew of, as we're local - but that was a ridiculous thing to worry about! The level of flexibility/customisation you get with Dodford is unmatched in our opinion; as it's such a beautiful venue to start with, you don't have to work hard to make it look good before adding in your personality as a couple!

The whole process from enquiries to final planning and the execution on the day were great. We did have a slight issue with them not inviting us to a food tasting in enough time before our wedding date (whether they forgot/we were missed off a list we don't know) but when we did raise it they invited us to a tasting at their sister venue instead (it's 2 hours away but we were available to travel thankfully). Every member of staff we encountered in our experience with Dodford were so friendly and make you feel like you are the only couple that matters for them in that moment, which we really appreciated from such a popular/busy venue. Abbie was our Event Manager on the day and provided such an elevated level of service, nothing was too much trouble and she executed our plans/vision to a tee, adding in some extra details that we loved too.

Our wedding was in December 2024, and we only had our reception at Dodford, so the ceremony barn was set up for our drinks reception with plenty of space for guests without it feeling cramped or equally like we were all rattling around in there (we had 75 guests for our reception). They don't have many photos of indoor drinks receptions in their promo so I was a little worried how it would look but the team had it set up beautifully. We also had a brass band on the mezzanine level which was really fun and festive!

What sold Dodford for us was the no daytime corkage, which meant we could really personalise our drinks reception and wedding breakfast drinks without breaking the bank. There was a slight disconnect with how and when we had requested/planned to serve some of the drinks in our planning meeting and what happened on the day, which we think may have been a slight hiccup in communication between Dodford and Jenkinsons (the caterers), but it didn't have a negative impact on our day at all!

Overall, there's a reason this is such a popular venue - it is truly perfect!"
V157,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,Dodford manor is an amazing wedding venue. From the very beginning when we first stepped into the venue to look around we fell in love. We knew we had to have our wedding there. After booking the venue we had amazing contact with the staff from booking our food tasting session. To a general email to see how our wedding planning was going. The planning meeting was well organised and we were able to talk through exactly what we wanted and no want was too big for the team.
V158,Gosfield Hall,"I never imagined my wedding would be somewhere as stunning as Gosfield hall but from the minute we saw this venue we knew it was the one for us and didn't bother viewing anymore venues as we had already made our minds up about having our wedding here! We were absolutely blown away with the natural beauty of Gosfield hall and so booked two years in advance of our wedding day! The professionalism and advice we received from Linda was super helpful and informative on the run up to our wedding as there is soo much to think about! We loved that we could have our day and evening all in one place aswell as the option weather permitting to have our wedding ceremony outside. I'm pleased to say the weather was absolutely perfect on our wedding day and we got to have our fairytale wedding outside! The package we paid for was well worth the money! Our guests were absolutely spoilt on our day and have all said it was the best wedding they've ever been too! It was amazing to have our guests stay over aswell! Jocie our wedding planner was absolutely amazing! She was sooo friendly and super accommodating and went above and beyond on our day to make it absolutely perfect with no hiccups! She even helped dress me on the day as she knew how to do up a corset dress and my mother didn't have a clue lol she made all my wedding details and decorations come to life and done such a stunning job decorating our dream venue aswell as being super supportive towards me my family and guests! The honeymoon suite is the best we've ever seen and completely took ours and our guests breaths away! Mind blowing! The food,venue,grounds,accomodation and night before accomodation were absolutely stunning and we want to thank everyone at Gosfield hall for making our day soo incredible and special and a day we and our guests will never forget! We can't wait to return to Gosfield! Thank you everyone at Gosfield what an amazing place!"
V158,Gosfield Hall,"We had previously experienced Gosfield Hall as a guest before deciding on it for our anniversary.

Our day was beautiful and went according to plan. Our guests all had great feedback about the day.

The only thing we would have changed would have been more diverse menu for the main meals."
V158,Gosfield Hall,"Gosfield hall is a beautiful location for a wedding and their packages cover all the important stuff! We didn’t have to worry about caterers, wedding coordinator or a DJ - all included! Great service, lovely food and everyone really enjoyed the day! Our coordinator Jocie was fab on the day, getting everything organised and fetching anything we needed. Couldn’t have asked for better, she knew the time line and the day flowed really smoothly!"
V158,Gosfield Hall,"We got married at Gosfield Hall and everything about it was perfect from when we arrive to view it, booking, the communication and Faye Carter our wedding Coordinator! If you want the best wedding day with no hassle, Gosfield is your place!!"
V158,Gosfield Hall,"Myself and my Wife have just got married at Gosfield Hall,
Our expensive started when we viewed the venue and we first met Linda sales manager, she welcome us in & made us feel at home, we wasn’t sure how, but she made us feel calm like this was where we was meant to be.
Once we looked around at all the venue has to offer we had already made a decision as this is such a stunning location and instantly new this was what we wanted! It was just right for us.

We did not get made to feel pressured to make any decisions immediately however we did end up booking our big say within the next few days after our visit.

Our next contact was with Ellie our wedding planner, she was very helpful and nothing was ever to much, we enjoyed the food tasting at the venue and was very impressed with the experience, it was out of this world.
Ellie helped us through all of our problems and made sure all of our plans come to life.

Now on our big day, what can I say? The staff were amazing, Ellie couldn’t have done enough every time you wanted to ask a question she was next to us any time we needed something. She was there all the way through the day/ night & even the next morning, Ellie made our day Run seamlessly.
We’ve been to many weddings before but never have we had food as amazing as we did here.
Every guest was amazed at the food quality and commented on how delicious it was!
Just to sum up if you’re thinking about booking your wedding at Gosfield Hall don’t question it just book it. You will be amazed."
V158,Gosfield Hall,"The venue is stunning and was the perfect setting for our winter wedding (so much natural light even in January). Jocie Golbourn was our assigned wedding planning specialist and she is so kind, sweet, patient and professional. All our guests loved the venue but many actually commented on how flawless and seamless the day was organised and rooms decorated and prepared from each section of the wedding and we only have Jocie and venue staff to thank for their meticulous planning and preparations. The food and drinks were delicious. Couldn’t recommend this venue enough- we actually booked the venue on a whim and were SO happy when we visited for an open day. There’s no false advertisements- it’s stunning."
V158,Gosfield Hall,"Everything, from start to finish, was exactly what we wanted and more. The preparation was helped by our wonderful personal manager, Tara, and accommodated each and every one of our requests and needs. The venue is gorgeous, food delicious, and atmosphere felt special. Our friends and family all told us that this was such a spectacular wedding for them that it was the best they've ever been to. We felt completely taken care of, kept us calm and happy throughout the day, and kept all of our suppliers in place and to standard. It felt glamourous and unique. We wish we could relive the day over and over. It really was our dream wedding."
V158,Gosfield Hall,"We got married in Gosfield Hall in May and had the most amazing wedding day that any couple could ask for. The whole experience from the arrival the night before to leaving the day after was seamlessly managed by the team at the venue.
The house and the grounds looked absolutely stunning and Ellie and the team did a brilliant job at keeping the day running smoothly without making anyone feel rushed. Everyone there was immensely friendly and helpful and we really felt that everyone who worked there was invested in making our day feel special.
We fell in love with the venue when we booked it but the whole experience exceeded out expectations so much that we wish we could do it all again!"
V158,Gosfield Hall,"I wanted to take a moment to commend and state our appreciation for Jocie. She truly was phenomenal, approachable and no task was too big.
We had 5 months to plan our wedding and we loved every moment. With us both working in the service industry it was great to have someone who was so switched on and would be an asset to have on any team."
V158,Gosfield Hall,"Having just got married at Gosfield Hall I can honestly say it was the most beautiful venue and the most perfect day. The staff were so attentive and professional. The food was outstanding and the drinks and cocktails were fabulous. They couldn’t do enough to make sure our day was everything we’d dreamt of. I have to say a special thanks to Ellie - one of the wedding coordinators on site - she went above and beyond to help us plan our day and was there from the very moment I woke up delivering fresh pastries for breakfast to the moment she made me a cup of tea to go to bed with. I can’t thank you enough Ellie, you are an absolute credit to Gosfield Hall."
V159,Kingston Estate Totnes,"When I first enquired with Kingston I thought it would be too expensive but we explained what are budget was and when we wanted to get married and they put a quote together that was affordable.
We have just had the most amazing one day wedding which didn't finish until the early hours. We got married in the Long Barn where there are chandeliers running down the middle, it was very romantic. There is this nightclub at Kingston which is very cool which everyone loved. The guests all said the venue was stunning and the food was out of this world.
A few of us stayed the night before and most of our guests stayed the night of the wedding in the cottages and barns. The staff were brilliant and they coordinated the whole day for us. I cant recommend the venue enough."
V159,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had a two day wedding at the Kingston Estate. All our guests were completely blown away by it.
Most of our friends and family had traveled far for the weekend and were not disappointed when then arrived as the cottages and barns are gorgeous. Some even have hot tubs.
Jodie and the Weddings Team organised a welcome party for the first night which was unreal along with providing street style food for everyone around 8.30 pm. At Kingston they have this really cool enormous Yurt and food hut which is used the day before the wedding and for breakfast.
On the wedding day itself we got married in the Walled Garden and there were endless canapes during the drinks reception. We then decided to eat in the Hayloft Barn which has glass windows overlooking all the gardens.
We used the clear span marquee for our reception party and had the craziest cover band before we all went into the nightclub until 3 am. The good thing about Kingston is everything is included they let you use things like cake stands, easels, knifes, speakers, microphones, all furniture at no extra cost, they set everything up for you and then clean up afterwards. We didn]t have to do anything which made everything totally stress free.

Thank you Jodie, Ellie and Charlotte it was insane !!"
V159,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had the most magical wedding at Kingston. From the moment we set foot onto the grounds, we knew it was the perfect place for our special day. It was our first viewing… and nothing else compared for us (we saw a total of 6 venues). What stood out to us the most was the variety of spaces available for each part of the day. The selection of ceremony areas, the beautiful outdoor spots for photos, the yurt for the night before party, and a special one for us… the underground nightclub for the evening! As party lovers, this was a part that sold it for us; there was somewhere for every moment.

One of the things we loved most was the flexibility to personalize every aspect of our wedding. The venue truly felt like a blank canvas that we could transform into our dream setting, but equally, we got away with doing absolutely nothing as it was beautiful all on its own.

But what truly made our experience unforgettable was the incredible staff, led by Jodie. They were not only professional and attentive but also genuinely warm and welcoming. Their support and attention to detail ensured that everything ran smoothly, allowing us to relax and fully enjoy our day.

We're hoping to return and stay in the future, for a special occasion.

It's not just a wedding venue; it's a place that holds a special spot in our hearts as the backdrop to the beginning of our happily ever after 🤍"
V159,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Kingston was perfect. Despite a rainy start, the day was amazing and Jodie was available but subtly in the background allowing the day to be ours."
V159,Kingston Estate Totnes,"After over a two and a half year wait due to Covid, our son and his wife had a wonderful wedding weekend. Jodie from Kingston Estate and her team of staff went above and beyond to ensure the wedding ran smoothly. Every detail was dealt with professionally. The accommodation, venue and food were all excellent and all our guests many from overseas had a wonderful time. The only thing Jodie could not oversee was the weather but even a little rain didn't spoil the celebrations."
V159,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue and staff were brilliant from start to finish. The venue is really multi-functional and caters for rain or shine. The weather was really unpredictable around the time of our wedding but I was a stress free bride knowing they had it in hand. The food supplier was stunning - we had a weekend package which all the guests raved about. That coupled with the unlimited drinks pages made it the perfect venue for us. A Devon treasure that feels like being on a film set - everyone loved it!
V159,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Such a beautiful venue - we loved it so much. The food was incredible and despite having a changeover of wedding planner close to the wedding day, it had no impact on our day what so ever. The venue are calm and professional and loved their approach to communication which was friendly."
V159,Kingston Estate Totnes,Fell in love with the venue on our first visit. We were particularly looking for a venue which could cater us for 3 days and sleep the majority of the the guests. The grounds were well kept especially the walled garden which is where the ceremony took place. The team were a pleasure and made the day truly special.
V159,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Our 3-day wedding celebrations were spent at the STUNNING Kingston Estate - a truly unique venue that we absolutely fell in love with. It had EVERYTHING we were looking for & more. The grounds are perfectly manicured all year round & come complete with walled garden. The cottages & main house are beautifully decorated, providing luxurious accommodation for 86 of our guests. Sarah & the team were such a pleasure to work with & couldn’t do enough for us. The catering was also top notch. Thank you"
V159,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue was great we had a few personal health issues beforehand but the team went above and beyond to make the day extra special. The wedding planner organised everything for us and they had plenty of props on site that we were free to use. We had the whole place to ourselves for the weekend it was brilliant and our friends loved the hot tub and pool.
V160,Holmewood Hall,"We were married at Holmewood Hall on 15th February 2025 and I can honestly say that it was the most magical day. We went to visit the venue and instantly fell in love with it but even we were blown away by how beautiful everything looked on the day. All of the staff were amazing - special shoutout to our personal wedding manager, Laura Pike, who was always on hand to answer any questions - she couldn’t do enough for us! The food was wonderful & we had full control over the menu. Would highly recommend this venue, you won’t regret it!"
V160,Holmewood Hall,"Holmewood Hall was an absolutely perfect wedding venue. The house is stunning, well cared for and beautifully decorated. All of the staff are so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Our Wedding Coordinator was fantastic, available from early morning of the wedding and was still there the morning after working for us. The food was excellent, drinks and canapes were amazing and the venue took care of everything for us. We had the most perfect wedding and are so pleased we chose Holmewood Hall. The Gold Room where we had our ceremony is gorgeous. Thank you for giving us a beautiful wedding!"
V160,Holmewood Hall,"I cannot fault this venue at all, the venue itself is breathtakingly beautiful with magnificent rooms and very lovingly maintained grounds. The staff are incredibly friendly, professional and efficient, our wedding coordinator Lee was a pleasure to work with and made our special day run smoothly. If you want a hassle free wedding with breathtaking grounds and the most amazing staff then this is the venue for you."
V160,Holmewood Hall,"Had the most amazing wedding here recently and cannot recommend it enough.

The venue itself is stunning and the options included in the luxe package covered everything we could've possibly wanted and made planning the wedding 100x less stressful.

The staff were all amazing from start to finish, Katie showed us around initially and then Lee was our personal wedding manager, and they were both incredible throughout. Always on hand to answer any questions and help us through the day once we got there.
We had so many comments from our guests on how lovely the staff were on the day!

A particular highlight though was the food - the tasting evening was a dream and the chef went above and beyond to provide a full vegan menu for us which wasn't limited to only a couple of options.
Again, we had so many non-vegan guests complimenting the food and saying how lovely it was!

Overall, an incredible day and an incredible venue.
Thank you so much to everyone there!"
V160,Holmewood Hall,"This place is simply just amazing 🤩
We had our wedding here on 17-12-24 and it was everything we dreamed of and more. The food, staff, decor were just perfect not forgetting the most beautiful Christmas tree 😍
Our person wedding planner Lee was an absolute god send not just having him there on the day but always being at the end of a phone to answer any questions or worry’s.
If we could go back and do it all again we would and not change a single thing.
The most perfect day at the most perfect venue ♥️"
V160,Holmewood Hall,Perfect venue for a wedding with guest numbers 60 - 100. Our guests and I moved from each room to a new room throughout the day and every room had a new surprise. The bridal suite was lush and it was great having all our guests staying under one roof. I would 100% recommend this to anyone.
V160,Holmewood Hall,"The wedding day and lead up to the day were fab. However, for the price we paid, we expected a little bit more.
I opted to use the bridal cottage the evening before for which we paid £450 extra. This is something I now regret, as there was no hot water and we were not able to order any food in as all the take away options were shut (on a Friday night). The hot tub also needed a good clean. So the night before/morning of my wedding was not ideal. I flagged this to the manager who advised that we should have raised the cold water issue as soon as possible, but seeing as we were trying to have morning showers on the wedding day, this did not leave us any time.
Our package included pre-drinks, wine with dinner and we also purchased a cocktail ""cart"" (cocktails on a table) and a bucket of beers. The groom, who is not a wine fan, asked for a beer with his wedding meal and was presented with a contactless card machine to pay for it at the top table. We felt this was a bit unnecessary as there was a full bucket of extra beers outside and it felt a little embarrassing having a card machine presented to us at the top table on our wedding day for one measly Corona, despite the huge amount we had paid. Also, guests were unknowingly allowed to buy beers from the bar after the meal, despite there being available beers to them already in a bucket next to the bar...
Overall the wedding was lovely, but for the price we paid we expected a bit better. Essentially, I loved the venue, but I wish we had not purchased any extras!"
V160,Holmewood Hall,"We got married at Holmewood Hall on 4th October 2024. From the first moment we stepped into the venue and I saw the magnificent Gold room I knew this would be the perfect place for us to get married. We had the most amazing day which was perfectly coordinated by the whole team at Holmewood but especially so by our personal wedding manager Lee. Lee was always quick to respond to any questions we had in the lead up to the day and nothing was too much trouble for him.
We honestly wish we could do it all over again as it was a magical day. We would recommend Holmewood Hall to anyone looking for the perfect venue."
V160,Holmewood Hall,"After getting engaged in late March this year we wanted to get married fairly quickly so booked Holmewood for the same September. The venue, grounds, accomodation were all stunning and we felt very fortunate it was within budget and the package we got was outstanding in comparison to other venues and what it included, which was far far more than other venues. We got to attend a luxe event to choose all our wedding food, canapés, cocktails and wines which should have made things easier but due to the unbelievable quality it made it harder! Our wedding planner Lee is literally the most fantastic person. He was flexible, fun, engaged and on absolutely everything. The day was ran impeccably and also smooth even with some weather concerns and speeches taking a bit longe than we thought. If you book here ask for Lee!! We had the most perfect day. Can’t fault a single things. Our guests all told us how incredible everything was with one even saying he will now longer not attend any further weddings unless it’s at Holmewood. Thank you to all the staff and as mentioned a huge special thank you to Lee! Your a legend!"
V160,Holmewood Hall,"Exceptional venue, stunning grounds, fantastic DJ, and excellent service. Highly recommended! Happiest day of my life 😊"
V161,Bourton Hall,"We got married at Bourton Hall on 08 March 2025 and our wedding planner was Harminder. The day was absolutely amazing from start to finish. All the food and drinks were of a high standard and presented beautifully which includes the wedding breakfast, canapés and cocktails, and breakfast the next day. The venue is gorgeous with lots of rooms, well maintained grounds and exclusive use. The staff are friendly and accommodating and the event was really well managed. We would like to particularly thank Harminder, who was supportive throughout the wedding planning process and the wedding day, ensuring things ran smoothly and in a timely manner. He is a great communicator, provided advice and guidance where needed and attention to detail. We really had a magical day! Thank you so much! We would happily do it all over again and would definitely recommend this venue!"
V161,Bourton Hall,"What a fabulous wedding venue! Because it's a wedding venue and not a hotel that holds the occasional wedding, they really focused on what was important and anticipated our every need. It's an elegant venue but with a comfortable feel to it. The team are incredibly accommodating and helpful and each couple is allocated their own personal wedding manager to guide them through the process and to make sure every detail is covered.
There's a beautiful chapel on site where non-religious ceremonies can be held - this was fabulous.
The food was plentiful and delicious - all our guests raved about it. Great choice of welcome drinks and canapes, wines and cocktails.
The grounds are gorgeous; a perfect backdrop for our October wedding.
The venue was exclusively ours and has beautiful bedrooms, including a huge, stunning bridal suite. Most of our guests stayed overnight and took advantage of the brilliant breakfast in the morning so it really extended the celebration."
V161,Bourton Hall,"Our wedding at Bourton Hall was better than we ever imagined. The Italianate mansion is truly spectacular inside and out however it is the team that made our day run perfectly. Our guests found the setting and the food incredible, they were very impressed! Our wedding planner Emily Sarjant was fantastic her knowledge and expertise made our day magical from start to finish, with all the special touches that she suggested. Our first dance was created in such a beautiful way it will be a memory we cherish forever. Thank you to Emily and the team at Bourton Hall. My husband would also like to note that the croquembouche was amazing and everyone should have one."
V161,Bourton Hall,"My wife and I got married at Bourton Hall in September, with our wedding managed by the wonderful Eleni. Everything about the day went as perfectly as we could've wished, right from arrival to departure the following day. The venue is stunning, and the food was lovely, and having 21 bedrooms on site was such a bonus so that all of our close friends and family could stay on site with us.
Bourton Hall did everything they could both in the run up to the day and on the day itself to alleviate all stress to ensure everything ran as seamlessly as possible, which it absolutely did.
We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall enough."
V161,Bourton Hall,"We were married on 28th July 2024. What an amazing day we had at Bourton Hall. Could not fault it! The venue is so elegant! The grounds and views were to die for. The food was out of this world with so many choices and all cooked and served to perfection. Accommodation / rooms were plentiful and luxurious. Lovely to have a chapel on site too. We had the whole place to ourselves, we felt like royalty! Lots of varied rooms and areas for people to choose where they wanted to be after the wedding breakfast. We would choose the venue all over again!"
V161,Bourton Hall,"We had both our wedding ceremony and reception at Bourton Hall and the service was superb throughout. The house and grounds are beautiful with amazing views to go with them. The staff were professional and helpful during the lead up to our wedding day and during the day as well - even when we had an emergency prior to the ceremony which caused delays, the venue staff were able to work around this to move timings back in order to allow all of our planned activities to go ahead and be fully enjoyed. All the food was delicious and we had a wonderful wedding day thanks to Bourton Hall."
V161,Bourton Hall,"We had the most perfect wedding day at Bourton Hall. Throughout the planning process and on the day, the team were so professional, which meant we could relax and know that everything was in their capable hands - Emily was an amazing wedding manager. The building is beautiful inside and out, and the grounds are stunning - there are so many places for beautiful photos, and views out over the countryside. The food was absolutely delicious, it was so hard to choose what to have! It was also so helpful to have so many places for guests to sit and chat in the evening, away from the disco room but still part of the action. Having so many bedrooms onsite (not to mention a stunning bridal suite!) was an added bonus. We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall highly enough, and have had so many comments from guests saying what a beautiful, elegant but relaxed day it was, so I know they really appreciated everything Bourton has to offer too. Thank you so much to Emily and the whole team for giving us such a perfect day!"
V161,Bourton Hall,"As the Bride and Groom we were made to feel like nothing was too much to ask and they couldn't do enough to make us feel special.
All the guests commented that it was one of the prettiest and most relaxed weddings they have been to.
We could not have asked for a better wedding day thanks to Bourton!"
V161,Bourton Hall,"I had my wedding on 10/02/2024 I am so happy I chose this venue, It is really magical. My wedding manager was just the best! Emily went above and beyond to help me on my big day! I cannot thank her enough.

One of the main things about this venue is that t has its own chappel which is really special and makes you wedding seem more traditional, however there are more options/ rooms available. I wanted the wow factor and I got it.

Some of the options that made it great

*Onsite accommodation for night before and night of the wedding is really helpful
*Exclusive use
*Dedicated wedding manager definate gamechanger! (Emily)
*Menu choices are fantastic.

Everyone commented on the food being really nice ( we had the lamb) The evening buffet was also great. I paid extra to have a meal created as having part of my culture within the food at the wedding was very important to me, they did not disappoint.
Emily was perfect in so many ways, she knew exactly my vision once i explained it to her and she made sure that it became real for me. She adapted parts of the day so that it would work better, for example bringing the canapes outside whilst photos where being taken. Helping me into my dress, looking after my phone just everything I needed she was there. She really worked hard to make sure it run perfectly and it did.

Thank you emily!!! You made my day Great."
V161,Bourton Hall,We got married at Bourton Hall on 30th July 2023. It was the most amazing day ever! We are still receiving compliments from our guests on how stunning the venue was and the whole running of the day. This was 100% down to our wedding co-ordinator Harminder. He went above and beyond to ensure our day was absolutely perfect. He literally could not have done any more! Thank you again Harminder!!
V162,B&H Buildings,Bourne & Hollingsworth was such an exceptional venue for our wedding this September. This is the perfect place for you if you want a true London wedding that feels like a fun dinner/house party but on an epic scale. We used the top floor (the studios) for our sit down dinner (think candle light and tasty roast lamb) and headed downstairs for our reception with the basement club (below and hidden) for late night dancing. The place is stunning (greenery and glass everywhere and the cocktails are insane but what really makes this place are the people. The whole staff from Matt and Lizzie to the bar team to the dinner crew made our whole day seamless and so fun. Could not recommend B&H more highly for your London wedding.
V162,B&H Buildings,"Beautiful wedding celebration in the most stylish venue - we had an intimate wedding reception (drinks, dinner and more drinks!) at the Bourne & Hollingsworth Buildings. The staff members on duty were excellent - nothing was too much trouble and they served everyone with such professionalism. We couldn’t recommend it highly enough and we haven’t stopped talking about it since. All of our guests were so impressed with the space and how stylish it was. The bar, restaurant and greenhouse are all aesthetically beautiful and the botanical vibes make for a very relaxed, but premium setting. Special shout out to Lizzie who helped us coordinate everything and Matt on the day who led the team. Thank you so much - we had the best day and we couldn’t have wished to host it in a better venue."
V162,B&H Buildings,"India & the B&H team were seamless. Flexible, responsive, kind, and easy to deal with. They made our day so special. The food was fantastic, the drinks were lovely, and the value for money was first rate!"
V163,Leez Priory,"I never in my life thought I would get married in a place like Leez priory! The whole experience from start to finish was just fantastic. The price breakdown was manageable and there was no pressure to take any upgrades offered. The things we got in our package were phenomenal and having a wedding planner was tremendous - our lady (Leanne) was an absolute god send!
They catered to all our needs and we were made to feel so comfortable and nothing was a problem! I’d highly suggest going to an event there before hand, just to get a feel of what it’s like full of people and enjoy their delicious food. We actually enjoyed their entertainer ( singer) so much we hired him for our wedding ☺️
Lee priory is just so beautiful. I can’t speak highly enough x"
V163,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory on the 7th of September 2024. Considering how long they have been a wedding venue, they were pretty flexible with some of the ideas we had for the venue styling that turned out amazingly!

The staff really made the day something special and couldn't have done enough for us. Special mention must be made for Leanne, our wedding planner, who was amazing!

Highly recommend the venue and the incredible team that helped to make our day so special!"
V163,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in October 2024. This venue is stunning both inside and out with immaculately kept grounds and interior. The hospitality in the lead up to and on the day of the wedding was fantastic. The food was also brilliant. Another great perk of this venue is the amount of on site accommodation.

A couple of drawbacks / experiences during our wedding. There are only a few toilets in the main building which kept blocking and overflowing throughout the evening which led to us taking some guests to the dressing room or honeymoon cottage to use the facilities. You are also restricted by the venue on any external food or drink suppliers and the venues optional extras for this are quite expensive for what they are.

That asaide, we had the best day and evening at Leez Priory and would certainly recommend it!"
V163,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in August 2024- great venue and experience from initial viewing to leaving the morning after the wedding. Leanne acted as our wedding planner and was friendly, professional and helpful throughout. We opted for the classic package and the food was amazing quality with everyone commenting how full they were!
The venue is beautiful with several options for ceremony both inside and out. Accommodation was great too. The whole day ran smoothly with perfect weather - we will have very happy memories of our day!"
V163,Leez Priory,"Perfect venue and very attentive staff, lovely food and great communication from start to finish"
V163,Leez Priory,"Stunning venue. Fantastic Team. Very accommodating toward our unique ""surprise"" strategy. Our guests were truly surprised. Thank you."
V163,Leez Priory,"Leez priory was the 1st and only venue we looked around when we started planning our wedding. From the moment we stepped on the premises, everything just looked so perfect and exactly what we wanted from a wedding venue. When we got assigned our wedding co-ordinator Rachel, she was just absolutely spot on with everything we asked for and nothing was too big an ask for her. She made sure the day ran as smoothly as possible and took care of any issue that arose without me knowing (which I am forever grateful for!!)
The rest of the staff were amazing and very helpful.

The venue itself is just absolutely stunning and we loved that it has the pub area as well as the dance floor so it catered to all of our guests.

All of the rooms were lovely and it was so nice being able to stay in the fisherman’s lodge onsite the night before the wedding.

We genuinely cannot recommend this venue enough and it was 100% worth the money! 10/10!"
V163,Leez Priory,"We got married on a Tuesday in October to maximise the value of what we could get for our money; and honestly, we got everything we wanted and more. Leanne, our Wedding Manager was perfect at bringing an attention to detail and seamless organisation to the big day, and in the lead up. There wasn't one moment of the day where we felt stressed, as Leanne had it covered. In one particular instance, our flowers for the bridal party's hair hadn't arrived. Within five minutes of telling Leanne that we needed this, the flowers were with our hair and make-up suppliers to add the finishing touches.

Leez Priory as a venue is the most stunning setting, and offers an incredible range of areas in which the ceremony and reception can take place. There is also the opportunity for the bridal party to make use of the Fisherman's Cottage the night before the wedding, and for people to stay in the on-site accommodation on the evening of the wedding, making it the perfect venue for people also travelling from further afield.

Leez Priory were very accommodating, welcoming and were happy to work with us to make our day as perfect as possible. The food was incredible, and a total hit with all of our guests, and so many people have commented on how incredible the day was as a whole. You wouldn't be disappointed to choose Leez Priory."
V163,Leez Priory,They catered to our every need. To when we would ask for things they hadn’t been done before they still made sure it went smoothly. Leanne was amazing she made me feel so comfortable from the start. The whole day was stunning. Beautiful venue please go view it as you will not be disappointed
V163,Leez Priory,We got married on the 26 May 2024. This venue was absolutely brilliant! They catered for every need and made sure there was no stress on the day. Leanne was kind and level headed throughout and was always one step ahead! Do not hesitate to book- do it now!
V164,London Rowing Club,"We picked this place because we wanted somewhere fairly central and casual. We fell in love with the long room and the view. Our wedding was in October so we thought we'd have it cosy but we ended up with a beautiful autumnal day so everyone was on the balcony. The fairy lights were perfect and the other rooms were great to avoid leaving. The staff was so friendly and accommodating that we would definitely recommend the venue.

The only thing that could have tainted the day is that after three visits and many emails, we were never told that the river floods (a lot). We were flexible with our day so if we knew this we would have built it into our day, instead, I was told by the photographer on the day as I got out of the taxi that we wouldn't be able to take any group photos because the area would be flooded during the cocktail hour and half that we had assigned as photo time. This would have been disappointing but we all ended up running outside after the ceremony to take photos before the tide came in. My husband and I borrowed wellies for our couple photos. We had fun doing this, but I can imagine many couples being upset! My friend's electric car also flooded and they were obviously upset."
V164,London Rowing Club,"Annabel was meticulous in her help planning the wedding. Very knowledgeable and helpful.
On the day the rest of the staff were brilliant - there wasn’t an empty glass in the house.
Great venue at a reasonable price on the London riverside."
V164,London Rowing Club,"LRC was the perfect place to celebrate our wedding this summer. The venue staff went above and beyond to ensure that everything went as planned both before and during the event. Thanks in particular to Annabel who was responsive, helpful and always put us at ease in the build up. The location is stunning - couldn’t have asked for a better day!"
V164,London Rowing Club,"We just wanted to say an enormous thank you for everything. From the moment we came to visit the LRC on a slightly grey January weekend, we knew it would be a fabulous venue for our June wedding reception and it certainly did not disappoint. It really is the most beautiful setting and we have very fond memories of our guests enjoying drinks in the sunshine with the most fantastic view over the Thames. The venue has such character and lends itself beautifully to a wedding reception. We have received so many compliments from our guests and I would encourage anyone thinking about booking their wedding at the LRC to do it, you will not regret it! We were lucky to be blessed with beautiful weather so were able to have our jazz musicians play on the balcony for the drinks reception before moving into the Long Room for our meal. It looked stunning with the tables dressed and mantles adorned with flowers. Following the meal and speeches, guests enjoyed drinks back on the balcony and in the Fairburn and Members Rooms which provide plenty of seating, whilst the Long Room was cleared and the band set up. We then partied the night away.

From start to finish, the organisation was so straight forward. Annabel was very accommodating and full of helpful advice in the run up. I knew that on the day she would ensure things ran like clock work, which of course they did. Our suppliers also commented on how helpful the LRC team were to work with. On the day the staff were brilliant and went out of their way to ensure everything ran smoothly (including borrowing some large gym fans from the rowers to put in the Long Room to keep us cool as it was an unexpectedly hot day). We really can’t thank you enough and now need to think of an excuse to host another party with you in the future!"
V164,London Rowing Club,"We got married in St. Mary's church and then had our reception in the London Rowing Club in February 2023. It far exceeded our expectations and was an incredible fabulous stress-free day with thanks to the wonderful Annabel making the day just run.

In the lead up to the event, Annabel was incredibly responsive, helpful and helped us plan the day exactly how we wanted it. She answered all our questions really quickly, always got back to us, was very flexible with what we could do and allowing us to personalise the space. Prior to the event, Annabel arranged for us to go and have a look around on a couple of additional occasions to help us plan how we would want it to look. She also gave our caterers a tour of the kitchens as they were new to the venue.

In the immediate lead up to the day, Annabel helped with our suppliers in getting chairs delivered and bringing all the wine over a day earlier. On the day, she helped to make the day flow and just dealt with things throughout the day.

The venue itself is beautiful with three rooms to use. A middle reception room, a cosy snug and the main long room. In the main long room, there is a rowing boat hanging upside down with fairly lights. The main lighting can be dimmed and gave a wonderful atmosphere for the evening meal. As our wedding was a winter wedding, it was fairly chilly so they lit fires in the main room and snug which added to the atmosphere.

We had around 90 guests - could have fitted a few more just about. We used the round tables, tablecloths, linen, plates cutlery and glasses provided and they were perfect for a wedding and looked very smart. No need to hire these. As mentioned, we did hire separate wedding chairs instead of the conference chairs provided. There's a lot of decoration in the way of rowing memorabilia on the walls which means you don't have to actually do too much to make it interesting for guests.

Overall, the perfect London wedding venue with absolutely fabulous views across the Thames with a long balcony to enjoy from. To top it off Annabel is truly amazing and so helpful."
V164,London Rowing Club,"We had our wedding (ceremony+reception) at LRC in July, and the venue itself and the team we worked with were absolutely incredible! Everything on the day went without a hitch and we heard so many compliments on the location - our guests loved the balcony and the layout inside, which included plenty of space for anyone wanting a break from dancing to sit down and relax. Would recommend to anyone looking to host an event!"
V164,London Rowing Club,"London Rowing Club is a truly fantastic venue and we were both so delighted with how our day went! The venue has real character with the classic rowing memorabilia and it’s location on the Thames, and looks amazing when it’s all set up. The layout and size of rooms I thought were perfect for our wedding of about 70 (+15ish more in the evenings) and of course the big attraction is the balcony which all of our guests adored!! (I wish I’d had more time during the day to stand out there and enjoy it 😂). Not only is it a fantastic venue in a great location but what really made this the most amazing venue was how great all of the staff, and all the recommend suppliers were! The day exceeded expectations and we got compliments on the place and the staff from all our guests. Couldn’t be happier with the venue, it was perfect for us!!"
V164,London Rowing Club,"We found the London Rowing Club while desperately combing through London locations after our original venue fell through a few months before the day.
Luckily for us it was available due to a cancellation - kismet!
From the start the charming Annabel put us very much at ease and helped us to envisage the day as we hoped it would be. She was very flexible and helpful throughout the planning process.
We were incredibly lucky with the weather on the day and the venue really came into its own - it was virtually impossible to get guests off the terrace, which is the perfect size for our smallish event (65 people) and of course offers gorgeous river views.
We were well looked after by the team and everything went off without a hitch. The interior of the space itself is lovely with a great sense of history.
Nice additional touch - table tennis was made available in the entry room for the later part of the evening!

It's a special place and I'd thoroughly recommend for anyone seeking a memorable spot to tie the knot!"
V164,London Rowing Club,"We got married at the London Rowing Club on a brilliantly sunny winter day on Saturday. All the way through in the run up (after 2 years or more of postponements), Annabel and team bent over backwards to help us arrange everything, recommended some brilliant suppliers for food (Shona Pollock comes highly recommended) and flowers (same with Steph the charityflorist.)

So many of our guests said how lovely the venue and staff were on the day, and the whole place looked a million dollars with an amazing photo set on and around the balcony and river - although we haven't seen those yet. The corkage and bar tariff prices are also incredibly reasonable for an inner London location!

I can't recommend the LRC highly enough. It will live in memory for a very long time."
V164,London Rowing Club,"The London Rowing Club team alongside the Dinner Ladies went above and beyond to ensure that we had the wedding perfectly fitting our requirements. Throughout the entire all of the suppliers worked seamlessly together to ensure the space transformed as we progressively added guests and transitioned between eating, our ceremony, more eating, music and dancing. We wouldn’t have had it any other way. The attention to detail of the team is second to none - perfect for any bride and groom seeking a beautiful event."
V165,The Prince Albert,"The team at The Prince Albert were always accommodating, made everything easy and stress-free, and helped us organise an amazing wedding party. They really knew what they were doing, and helped guide us through the process calmly, working around our schedule (which wasn't easy - we live abroad!) to make sure all our last-minute worries and concerns were sorted smoothly. The food was excellent, and the space was fantastic for our party. Can't recommend it highly enough!"
V165,The Prince Albert,"We had such a happy wedding with Harrison and this venue. Harrison was really flexible and answered any questions we had and made great suggestions when we needed seating arrangements, the schedule for the day, a florist, and more. The day was accessible to everyone and the food and drink were perfect. Thank you for making out wedding stress free and wonderful."
V165,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert was the most wonderful venue for our London wedding. We came across the venue at there wedding fair and chose alot of our suppliers from the same wedding fair.

Harrison and Lauren were always so on hand to help with any questions and did a fantastic job answering all of our questions. The staff were so friendly and helpful and made everything run like clockwork.

We couldn’t recommend The Prince Albert enough for a london wedding and would love to do it all again."
V165,The Prince Albert,"My wife and I were beyond happy with how everything went on our wedding day. Harrison, Diana, Claudio and the whole team were absolutely phenomenal! It was such a beautifully efficient operation, and we always felt like someone was there to help us when needed.

We've had dozens of compliments about the great food and how wonderfully intimate the venue was for a wedding. Some of our more traditional relatives said they were initially sceptical at the prospect of a pub wedding, but that it was one of the most beautiful and joyful weddings they’d been to. A friend of mine was also very happy that someone at the bar remembered her drink order throughout the evening! On top of that, everything ran perfectly to schedule, which is no doubt down to the high attention to detail.

It was very useful that the upstairs was free on Friday afternoon so that we could set up the space. It gave us plenty of time to do the flower arrangements, put up the bunting, and stick photos on the frame wall.

Thank you again so much for all the help and support you've given us - it really was the best day of our lives (so far)!"
V165,The Prince Albert,"My husband and I got married here in late September 2023, and I cannot recommend the Prince Albert enough!! Booking a wedding venue can be stressful and we felt like a lot of the venues we looked at gave us the ""hard sell"" but the folks at the Prince Albert helped to put us at ease every step of the way. We fell in love with how beautiful the pub was, so hired the upstairs for the ceremony, wedding breakfast and party afterwards for around 40 - 45 people. We were able to drop off decorations the night before and talk it all through with the staff, and they did such a good job of working with us and the florist to get the place looking amazing. The ceremony went off without a hitch, everybody loved the food and we had a blast in the evening. All the staff were amazing, but special shout out to Harrison and Lauren for helping us plan and run the day, and Maria for managing everything on the ground both when we dropped off the decorations and during the wedding itself. Thank you again for helping us celebrate our special day with our loved ones, for making it so stress free and so memorable!"
V165,The Prince Albert,"All you ever hear about wedding venues is that everything is a rip off, the food is meh, and there are a ton of annoying restrictions...the opposite is true of Harrison and The Prince Albert team. From Day 1, Harrison made the whole process not only easy but really fun! He was quick to respond, super knowledgeable, and very accommodating; he even helped our best man execute a surprise for us without it disrupting any timings. On the day, they decorated the place beautifully, managed to serve a 3 course dinner to 76 people unbelievably fast, and everyone raved about the food - to say they did a good job is a gross understatement, they went above and beyond. We were after ""classy fun"" and that's exactly what we got - thank you so so much!"
V165,The Prince Albert,"We had the exact wedding reception we wanted at the Prince Albert thanks to Harrison, Claudio and the other amazing staff who helped us feel so relaxed in the build up and during. We wanted a very low-key vibe and the team understood that but there were enough options for any style of wedding you wanted. The upstairs function room felt cozy and intimate while still leaving breathing room and space to dance, but you could easily rent the whole place if you wanted more guests and even choose to do your ceremony there. We had the most compliments on our food (we chose a buffet option). The team were particularly accomodating to some complicated dietary requirements and it was all delicious."
V165,The Prince Albert,"July 6, 2023 was the most memorable day of our lives! A big thank you to Harrison and the rest of the team for assisting us through out the whole process. Our guests loved the Prince Albert pub especially the sumptuous food and booze on our wedding day!

David & Dannah"
V165,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert is a Great venue for the classic Pub Wedding.
Harrison and the team did an amazing job to organize everything. The food was great and the service first class. Only sorry it was over so quickly. Thanks again for everything."
V165,The Prince Albert,"We found The Prince Albert when our original venue cancelled on us less than 2 months before our wedding. & we are so glad we did; everything happens for a reason! From the moment we met Harrison, we knew we were in safe hands, and the team at the Prince Albert made our day amazing. The pub looked beautiful and we were very greatful for the effort the team put in putting up all our decorations. We had so many compliments about the food, and we were very impressed in the swift and organised manner in whichever it was served. Everyone had a wonderful time, and we would not hesitate in recommending The Prince Albert."
V166,Kindred,"We chose Kindred for our 60 person wedding and it could not have been better. We wanted a venue where we could have the ceremony, dinner and dancing all under one roof, that was wheelchair accessible, and easy to get to on the tube, Kindred ticks all those boxes and more!
The food is incredible, we really enjoyed popping by to do all the tastings, we'll continue to come to the Cellar for food and cocktails. Many guests commented on how good the food was.
The place itself is gorgeous, inside and out. We used the whole venue, the main Hall for the ceremony, dinner and dancing, and the Library upstairs for the drinks reception and cake cutting. Also, being right next to Hammersmith station, the venue could not be easier to get to!
The staff are wonderfully attentive and helpful, both before and on the day. They were really open to the little details that made our day uniquely ours, from the drinks selections, to having a table and glasses on stage for the ceremony, to playing our music selections at the right time. Plus its a dog friendly venue!"
V166,Kindred,"We LOVE this venue! We got married here with only 12 weeks notice and Anna, the owner, and her staff went above and beyond to make the day as memorable, magical, and marvellous as we'd hoped it would be. The venue is elegant, stylish and perfect for a London, city based wedding. The food is sensational as it comes from their in-house kitchen on the ground floor and every guest remarked on how delicious their meal was. It's restaurant quality food, not your standard wedding food. The place looks stunning in all our wedding photos and the wedding cake they made us (at very short notice I might add!) was second to none. Everyone loved it. The venue was also perfect for late night dancing and drinking and merriment. It was such a pleasure - and a breeze - to work with Anna and her team on one of the most important days of my life, and I very much hope to do so again in the future. I will forever be grateful to her and all she helped us with."
V166,Kindred,"We had our wedding reception for 35 guests at Kindred, in the Library and Salon earlier this year. The day went incredibly smoothly, the staff couldn't have been more attentive and our guests raved about the food for weeks afterwards. It was the perfect sized space for our intimate celebration, really cosy and the atmosphere was great. The little touches really helped to make the day special, with espresso martinis served for the speeches and sparklers for our exit at the end of the night. Thanks again to the lovely Kindred team!"
V166,Kindred,"I cannot find a single fault in our experience with Kindred for our wedding. Not only was it a stunning venue that honestly made some of our guests gasp as they arrived, but Anna and the team were so incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. Having them support us really took so much of the wedding planning stress away and we knew we were in safe hands. I really appreciated that the team were happy to chat through ideas with me and were always keen to find creative solutions to give us the day that we had envisioned.

The food was absolutely delicious and they were so accommodating for our long list of dietary requirements from our guest. The cocktails were also so delicious. Our guests were buzzing for weeks after, as were we.

On the night, the staff were not only incredibly helpful and efficient, but also just so friendly, welcoming and complimentary. We felt thoroughly spoilt and very well looked after.

We visited so many venues and this was by far the best choice for us. The interiors made for some stunning photos and the layout of the spacing meant that whilst we had 80-100 guests, it still felt very intimate. I cannot recommend Kindred enough!"
V166,Kindred,"We would give a thousand stars if we could. Kindred hosted us for our cocktail style wedding and it was everything we could have hoped for and the perfect venue for this style of wedding. The wine, cocktails and food (incredible grazing board, canapés, bowls and pizzas) were exceptional and the team were on top of everything, friendly and nothing was ever an issue. We would HIGHLY recommend it. We have had loads of guests message us to tell us what a spectacular venue it was with the most friendly team. The venue had different spaces to suit our needs and the AV is amazing - it worked perfectly for our live music band and our DJ, and our own music playlists for our ceremony. They took the stress off planning and really did mean we could relax and not worry that everything would run smoothly. Thank you so much Kindred team for giving us the best day of our lives"
V167,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The best day of our lives and me and my now husband couldn't be more thankful to Bredenbury. Before booking Bredenbury we visited over 17 wedding venues in Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Herefordshire - we fell in love instantly, there is no need for a crazy amount of extra expense on decorations, the venue speaks for itself. The fact that it was no corkage just added to why we wanted to book and the team were so friendly. In the lead up to the wedding they were brilliant, we booked far in advance and brought over all our family members to come see the venue, they were so flexible, understanding and welcoming - they couldn't do enough for us. On the wedding day they had decorated for us by the time we had arrived and all we had to do on the day was to enjoy it - which was perfect. It really was the best day of our lives, all the comments from our family and friends was how beautiful the venue was. They kept the day running so smooth and we didn't need to think about a thing."
V167,Bredenbury Court Barns,"There truly aren't words to describe how incredible Bredenbury Court Barns and their entire team of fantastic staff were through the planning process and the day itself. They were so friendly, supportive and nothing was ever too much. From quick replies to any questions that popped to mind to planning meetings that left us feeling prepared and ready to the day being set up beyond perfectly. Our amazing wedding coordinator Lianna spent the days and months (years really!) leading up to our big day making sure everyone detail was perfect, that everything was incorporated that we'd dreamed of and made sure we didn't feel a moment of stress from start to finish. All throughout the building from the bridal booth, to the orangery to the oak barn was beautifully light and open - even with our wedding being the end of October - and we had so many compliments about this! There aren't enough words to say thank you and explain just how much we'd recommend this venue to everyone"
V167,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We had the perfect day back in July. The weather didn't go to plan but they helped make the day so special even with the last minute switches because of the rain. We had such an amazing day and the feedback from our guests about the venue, food and service was great! We cannot thank the team enough for the effort they put in throughout the whole process but especially on the day. We felt incredibly supported throughout the whole process."
V167,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The venue itself is stunning. The buildings, grounds and interior decorations are all beautiful and immaculately presented. From the moment you turn down the lane it is so picturesque, you know you've found somewhere special. It's exactly what we were imagining for our wedding venue.

The layout is perfect, with ample space for guests to mingle and move about, and great accessibility for older and disabled guests. Ours was a winter wedding, and while most of the day was inside it wasn't cramped and we could still enjoy the beautiful grounds through the expansive windows that run along the whole barn.

All of the venue is stunning, but practicality-wise the Bridal Suite warrants a special mention. Room length mirrors, plenty of room for the bridal party to get ready, have their makeup and hair done, and if there's time to relax as well. Drinks were served from 11 onwards, and it has it's own toilets and shower.

From our first meeting at Bredenbury the staff were exceptional. They gave a reassuring air of professionalism and experience, with just the right level of excitedness for our day without it feeling forced. We were really impressed by how responsive the whole team were, with speedy replies to any questions we had during the planning. This is something we particularly appreciated as we only gave ourselves 7 weeks to plan our big day.

Value for money wise it felt tricky to gauge when we were trying to choose a venue as the headline figure is rarely what you'll end up paying, with different venues charging different amounts for different things. Not the case with Bredenbury. With their No Corkage policy and generosity in being able to use whatever props they already have, any extras were non-essentials of our own choosing.

No Corkage is pretty significant. Some venues wanted to charge £20/bottle, so not having to pay this and being able to supply not only our own wine but beers, gin and soft drinks for the drinks reception and wedding breakfast was not only a massive saving but also made the occasion more personal for us. The bar staff and catering team were excellent, pouring and serving drinks, warming our mulled wine and setting up the gin bar. Once your guests have drunk you dry the venue's bar is well stocked and standard pub pricing.

We wanted a Christmas wedding and seeing in early November that they had a date available that December we couldn't resist. 7 weeks isn't long to organise a wedding with nearly 100 guests, and we couldn't have done it without the Bredenbury team being so organised. Our assigned event manager, Harriet, was brilliant in the runup and on the day, as were all the other managers and staff we spoke with. The Wedding Bible they fill out with you is a great idea and nails down all the finer details to ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible on the day.

We didn't want to have to spend the day before and morning of our wedding worrying about set up and decorations, but needn't have worried as Bredenbury did all of this for us. A meeting beforehand clarified what we wanted where; we simply dropped off boxes of stuff the day before and rocked up in the morning to find everything laid out as hoped.

This organisation extended to the third party suppliers, of which Bredenbury have an extensive list of local recommendations. We booked the ceiling lights with Cotswold Wedding Co. and didn't have to do anything else. The band, Apollo Gold (incredible!!) set up without any hassle and didn't have any issues with Bredenbury's noise limiter. Our florist Katrina Bevis hadn't been there before, but again had no problem getting everything in place on the morning.

On-site accommodation was good for close family and friends, but there's not enough for the majority of guests and the lack of a dedicated honeymoon suite is a bit of a shame. If you want privacy for your first night as a married couple it means taking over an entire lodge. The quality and comfort of the rooms is excellent, though, and the continental breakfast served the morning after in the East Lodge was delicious, with ample options for Vegan and Gluten Free.

Jenkinsons are the exclusive caterer for Bredenbury and have an extensive menu for nibbles, the wedding breakfast and dinner. The menu and ordering process is clear, and pricing is what we expected to pay. Food and service was as slick and faff-free as everything else. A real delight.

On the day, Harriet and the catering manager were absolute superstars. Zero stress, everything ran to time and as planned, and they were always available if we had any questions or needed help.

The whole day was perfect and exactly what we wanted. I don't think we could have achieved this without the exceptional organisation of Harriet and the team. The entire process was very slick, zero stress, and we wouldn't hesitate in recommending Bredenbury Court Barns to anyone looking to get married in a countryside paradise."
V167,Bredenbury Court Barns,"I want to say a massive thank you to Bredenbury Court Barns for hosting our wedding. From the start they were super amazing and accommodating to us. They won us over with their care and support even when we had a pickle in the beginning.

Olivia was super helpful from the start and throughout the year we were planning she offered huge amount of support and suggestions.

We typed in “orangery weddings” in google when we were first looking because I was keen to get a ceremony in an orangery and Bredenbury popped up after much searching. Once we saw the Orangery we cancelled every other viewing we had across the country because we felt we found the perfect place, and nothing compared to the reception with the beautiful windows that brought all the light in. The grounds were absolutely spectacular and gorgeous. It was a no brainer for us to pick such a beautiful venue. They brought my ideas to life and we were able to get support on anything from recommendation of suppliers, to ideas on decor to their favourite meals from Jenkinson’s. They fully outdid themselves in love for us. We can’t forget it.

Our wedding day was exceptional with Lianna helping us all the way. She was a breath of fresh air. She cared about all the little details and made us feel relaxed and had a good laugh with us. The fact she was there 100% of the way, before the wedding, during the wedding, and even after is unmatched! Thank you Lianna for really being there to make our wedding day smooth and relaxing.

The food was incredible too and we often think about how sad it is that we didn’t finish our second plates, we think about it a lot.

Thank you for the wonderful journey BCB, you blew us away with your integrity, kindness, and genuine support!"
V167,Bredenbury Court Barns,thank you to everyone at bredenbury court barns who made our day so special
V167,Bredenbury Court Barns,"From the moment we stepped foot into Bredenbury Court Barns, we knew this was the venue for us. It was the first and only venue we viewed as we were blown away by how gorgeous the venue is. The venue itself is absolutely stunning, with breathtaking views and impeccably maintained grounds that set the perfect backdrop for our special day.

The staff went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. From our first consultation to the last dance, their professionalism and attention to detail were exceptional. Harriet was absolutely brilliant and I don’t know what we would have done without her!

The food was another highlight—our guests are still talking about how delicious everything was! Jenkinsons are amazing, they helped us personalise our menu perfectly!

We couldn’t have asked for a more beautiful venue to have our wedding. The day couldn’t have been more perfect! Thank you to everyone at Bredenbury Court Barns for making our wedding day nothing short of magical!"
V167,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We could not have had a more perfect experience with Bredenbury Court Barns. Right from initial booking all the way through to breakfast the following morning, everything was perfect. Nothing was too much trouble for our wonderful planner, Lianna. She ensured the day ran smoothly and our months of planning turned out exactly as we’d imagined. They are available to answer any questions you have any time, they’re only an email away and get back to you so fast. The venue itself if just gorgeous, the grounds make for some wonderful photos, and the orangery lets so much light in that your ceremony photos are gorgeous. The whole place is fully air conditioned too which was great for our July wedding. The bridal suite is a perfect balance of being aesthetically pleasing and practical for getting ready in, it’s so spacious, lots of natural light, there’s plenty of plug sockets and huge mirrors so everyone has plenty of room for getting ready and no one is on top of eachother. There’s even an outside space for getting some fresh air. I’m so glad we chose to have our wedding here, it’s given us memories to cherish forever and there are zero memories of any stress!! Cannot recommend this venue enough!"
V167,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We cannot believe how lucky we fell to get married at such a beautiful venue. Right from the offset of viewing the venue, to our special day, we were taken of. No question was too silly, and so much pressure was taken off us during the planning. We managed to make everything our own and Lianna was there every step of the way. Thank you for giving us our happily ever after. We will forever be grateful."
V167,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We loved our wedding at Bredenbury the team did an amazing job providing everything we asked for and more. We especially liked that our wedding coordinator for the day, Harriet had thought of everything for us she went above and beyond and even offered to go and get my mum some more shoes when hers broke! absolute 5-star service and the food was amazing too!"

V169,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow what can I say, Brinsop is an absolutely stunning wedding venue with heaps of character and so many options of places for the ceremony and to do things. We fell in love with it as soon as we saw it and knew it was where we wanted to get married.

Right from the start, the Brinsop team were so helpful and accommodating. From giving an virtual tour then showing us around in person, Issy and the team were fantastic right the way through. Nothing was a hassle, no request too difficult and they were incredibly professional and responsive throughout the whole process.

We loved that Brinsop is an exclusive venue with accommodation on site so we could stay with the bridal party and our immediate family. All the rooms are unique and have so much character and it's fun exploring the whole place. You feel like you are in the middle of nowhere, in nature with swans, ducks and birds all around.

Throughout our planning process, Issy and the team helped us every step of the way, being incredibly flexible in managing our requests and really trying to create our vision. They even got their team to make a giant jenga that we could use on the day! They helped to create the most perfect bespoke wedding breakfast and canapes menu, and seemed so positive and excited to be part of our special day and experience.

Arriving at the venue, Issy and the team were ready and had everything prepared and ready to go. It made the process so smooth for us and meant we could really enjoy the day without any stress. Issy coordinated perfectly with all of our vendors and it really felt like she and the whole team were so happy for us and wanted to be part of our day which was amazing. Our guests commented on how friendly and responsive all the staff were and it really made the experience extra special.

I wouldn't change anything about the day and it was perfect. I would absolutely recommend Brinsop as a wedding venue and all the staff who are really invested in helping deliver your vision. Thank you so so much to the whole team for making this a day that we will look back on for many years to come with amazing memories."
V169,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow, what a perfect day we had! It really went without a hitch and that was thanks to Nina and all the staff at Brinsop. The team worked seamlessly to ensure the day was as perfect as could be, and it really was! The wedding was booked over 2 years in advance and the staff were so accommodating with all my questions, planning and site visits, they couldn’t do more to support us. Special thanks to our coordinator Nina who was a delight to work with and a credit to Brinsop. Everyone that attended agreed at how beautiful the venue and grounds were, it was a wedding people won’t forget! 10/10 would recommend to anyone!"
V169,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"It's taken me quite a while to get round to writing this review, because sadly it's quite a bittersweet one.

We were married last year on 15 June and Brinsop was our chosen venue for both our ceremony and reception. We were first attracted to brinsop by the accomodation, meaning our loved ones could stay on-site, especially my grandparents which was so important to me.

The home itself is absolutely beautiful, including ivy cottage which myself and my mum stayed in the night before the big day. It really was a picture perfect setting, and looking down from the bridal suite seeing the ceremony space being set up on the Wordsworth lawn was honestly magical. Id dreamed of an outdoor wedding on that lawn, and we were so grateful the weather cleared so we could have it. The team really did wait till the latest they could to ask us to make a call on an inside or outside wedding (despite being June, it was a gloomy day to start) which I really appreciated!

Another amazing part of hiring brinsop was the after hours space we were able to enjoy until 2am with our house guests. The games room was absolute fantastic and meant that if you wanted to go to bed you could, but you could also stay up, party and play pool. I really do think this was a highlight for our guests and would recommend massively if you can spare some budget.

On the night of the wedding, myself and my new husband actually stayed in one glamping tents which we absolutely loved. The groundsman was on site until we were ready to leave the games room, and he then took us up to our tent in one of the buggies, making sure we had plenty of blankets and even stopping off for some bottles of water for us. This was really special, and can't thank him enough.

Hugo Spritz!! Having hugos at both our welcome drinks and drinks reception after the ceremony was amazing. I'm not a fan of prosecco myself and Mark and the team made it possible for us to have Hugo's all round. We even sneaked some up to the bridal suite to have before the ceremony (thanks Nadia!). Our guests loved them, and the amount of people that have told me they now need them at their own wedding is crazy!

Onto the not so good - sadly it all started to go a little downhill when we moved things into the knot barn for our wedding breakfast. Sitting on the top table, I could see that guests at the top of the second rows of long tables didn't really even have a seat around the table and were just kind of plonked on. The seating plan hadn't been followed, and I don't think there were even enough tables laid for the service to be comfortable for people because there was a dance floor at the end of the barn (which I did not ask for).

It was quickly also brought to my attention, that one of our guests had had to put her child on her lap in order to remove the high chair so people had more space. We also lost about 5 napkins with them setting on fire from the candles because everything was just way too cramped.

I asked to speak to catering, and asked if there was anything that they could do. I was told 'well sure, if you want the whole thing to be late'. In truth I shouldn't have even had to broach this myself, as it should have been sorted by the coordination team.

The tables weren't changed, even after they'd said they'd sort after the first course and yet the whole meal still ran late. We've had so much feedback about people not having enough food, food not being easy to access on the sharing platters etc and honestly when you've waited so long for a day and had spent 25k on the venue and food alone, it really has been heartbreaking to hear. I do sometimes question why people still bring it up (even now, people talk about the dining) when it clearly upset me so much.

Whilst writing this review my husband asked my what we had for evening food - we didn't get any. It was left unannounced on a back table. I don't know what I was expecting, just not that.

The next morning, the houseguests were asked to come down to breakfast for 9am (it was on a note in the room) but as we were in the glamping area, we walked past the knot barn just before 8.30 and the food was already out. We ran down to the house to hurry everyone up, and by which time everyone arrived it had been sitting there for 20plus mins going cold.

My biggest upset was that when I fed all of the above back to brinsop, feeling pretty deflated about the catering, I was told they'd pass my feedback on and heard absolutely nothing back. 25k total with over 10k on food and drinks to hear absolutely nothing, and this was 9 months ago. I'm not saying this in would happen to anyone else, but really - it shouldn't have happened to us either."
V169,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our wedding! From start to finish, everything at Brinsop was flawless. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most magical backdrop for our special day. Our guests were blown away by the beautiful venue, the warm atmosphere, and the seamless coordination. Every detail was taken care of, and we felt so well looked after. The team was incredible, professional, friendly, and attentive. On the day itself, they ensured everything ran smoothly, allowing us to truly enjoy every moment. A special mention goes to our amazing wedding coordinator Nina!"
V169,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We had our wedding on New Year's Eve 2024 at Brinsop, and it was more perfect that we could have ever hoped for. The venue itself is stunning, with beautiful spacious rooms which slept over 40 of our guests. Our coordinator, Nina, was incredible and so supportive on the day - she kept everything running so smoothly and everything went by without a glitch. The food and drink managers Mark and Amy did the most incredible job - nothing was ever too much, they were so attentive, and the chefs the most stunning meal after we gave them a fairly vague brief of 'curry'! We had the most perfect day and we're so incredibly grateful to Brinsop and the team."
V169,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,Brinsop Court is pure magic—an unforgettable venue with an incredible team!
V169,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We were lucky enough to have our wedding at Brinsop Court in December, and it was an absolutely spectacular day. We fell in love with Brinsop as soon we set our eyes on the beautiful manor and surrounding gardens. Cate, Amy, Mark and the rest of the wonderful staff at Brinsop really go the extra mile to make you feel special, and are extremely flexible with requests in order to make your day feel more special. We honestly felt like there was no request too big leading up to the day and they really made us feel extremely comfortable leading up to the day.
On the day, Cate and her team were well on hand to help us with setting up everything and she had everything under control when there were a few hiccups. The day itself was absolutely magical, and that wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for everyone at Brinsop working extremely hard to ensure that everything went to plan and as smoothly as it could.
Thank you to everyone at Brinsop for making us feel at ease and ensuring that our wedding was an amazing day."
V169,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Brinsop, the perfect wedding venue! We got married at Brinsop in December and I can honestly say it was everything we could have hoped for and more. We found out about the venue through Hitched and was one of only two venues that we visited but as soon as we got the house we knew it was the one. We fell in love with everything about it and it was fair to say that our guests agreed with us with many saying it was the nicest venue they’d been to. We had the wonderful Nina as our coordinator and she was brilliant! Nothing was too much trouble and we had constant communication with her in the build up which helped our stress levels no end. The same can be said for all of the staff who were brilliant throughout and allowed us to have the best day of our lives with everything running seamlessly. A special mention must be given to Amy and the catering staff who put on such an incredible menu (including the tasting session that provided some of the best food we’d ever had) and ensured that the food has been one of the main things that people have mentioned to us since the wedding! We had our ceremony in the Banqueting Hall which provided the perfect setting, especially with it being a winter wedding, as it really added to the cosy atmosphere and the lounge areas/games room were perfect for the drink’s reception. We would have loved to have also had it in the courtyard, but the temperatures meant that the lounge with the fireplace was a far more appealing option on the day. We then had the wedding breakfast and reception in the knot barn which was decorated beautifully and was the perfect place for the party in the evening. Overall we really can’t thank everyone at Brinsop enough for making our day what it was, we can honestly say that we have been made to feel part of the family and already can’t wait to hopefully come back to stay in one of the cottages for our first anniversary!"
V169,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Where do I start!!
Brinop Court is the most stunning venue, it was the first venue we visited and instantly fell in love! Theres so much history to the house and we were treated like family every time we visited before the wedding and it literally felt like home the whole weekend of the wedding, my guests also agreed!!

A special thank you to Issy our coodinator who went above and beyond ti make sure everything was perfect for us. It was so easy to plan and nothing was too much to ask, even arranging our dog to be our ring bearer!! When they say Brinsop is dog friendly they really mean it!!!

What a place, what a day!! Thank you so much everyone, you all made our day perfect and it really was the best day of our lives♥️"
V169,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We got married at the gorgeous Brinsop in October this year. It’s hard to put into words how amazing the whole experience was. We honestly had the best day of our lives!!!

We fell in love with Brinsop during our first visit back in December 2022. We knew almost immediately that Brinsop was the venue we were looking for! From the outside the venue looked like a painting - from the picturesque views of the countryside, to the swans swimming on the moat! The manor house itself has so much character, and has a lovely homely feel to it as you walk around it. Our guests were equally blown away by the venue!

A big thing for us was that it’s dog friendly, which meant we could have our two dogs join us on our special day, it wouldn’t have been the same without them there! They had so much fun walking around the grounds and greeting all of our guests!

Nina, our coordinator, and her team were always available to answer any of our questions in the run up to the day. This really put us at ease, knowing we were in safe hands. On the day, Nina and the team made sure everything ran smoothly and went above and beyond to ensure our guests were looked after. A shout out to Amy who heads up catering and Mark who manages the bar. The food and drinks were absolutely fantastic!

I highly recommend this venue! There’s a reason Brinsop is an award winning venue - and when you visit it’s not hard to see why. We are already looking forward to going back there for a date night next year! Thanks for everything Team Brinsop!

V170,The Manor at Bickley,"The Manor is the perfect venue for weddings! When our wedding venue fell through 4 months before the big day, I stumbled onto the Manor at Bickley and spoke to Craig. He was most helpful and kind and went above and beyond to make sure our wedding went ahead.

We hired the venue for our two day wedding and the staff were helpful and accommodating from start to finish. All of our guests were awed by the beautiful well kept grounds and the excellent service. We can’t thank the staff enough for making our wedding dreams a reality. They thought of every detail from bringing us champagne after our civil ceremony to making sure we had our card box at the end of the night! We are excited to head back to celebrate our anniversary there!"
V170,The Manor at Bickley,"Myself and my Husband chose this venue for our wedding last week and we can’t sing The Manor’s praises enough. From our very first enquiry, to the first viewing of the venue, right though until the big day, the staff at the manor have been nothing short of brilliant! Each staff member we came across was polite and accommodating. Special mention to Craig and Vicky with whom we did most of our liaising throughout the months leading up until our wedding. Craig and Vicky were super helpful, responsive and went above and beyond to make sure that we could have the day of our dreams. Even with last minute changes due to the weather, Craig who was just incredible throughout, managed to help us sort a backup plan so our day would still go ahead seamlessly.

The rooms at the manor were spacious and modern, giving us and our wedding party lots of space for photographers and videographers to capture the special moments on our wedding morning.

The lodge that was used for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready was fabulous. The manor was very flexible in giving us early access so we could get ready on time.

The grand marquee was definitely grand! Very spacious and when decorated looked like something out of a fairytale! lots of kitchen space, a huge bar and fantastic overhead speakers for the party!

The manor was super flexible to our needs regarding access, start times, outsourcing our vendors and much more. The venue is beautiful and spacious with options for outdoor and indoor events and entertainment. The grounds were absolutely beautiful, so many lovely spots for photos not only for us as the bride and groom but for guests too!

A very special thank you to our point of contact throughout, Craig. From our first meeting, he was charming, bubbly and made us feel super welcome. He reassured us that he has experience in African/Caribbean weddings and that our wedding day would amazing and it was. He was attentive and always let us know that he was only a phone call or e-mail away and was always quick to respond and answer any questions we had.

All in all, we had the most beautiful day at The manor and we would definitely recommend this venue for a wedding or other events.

V170,The Manor at Bickley,"We hired The Manor at Bickley for my daughters wedding. Got a brilliant service from the venue. Everything was set accordingly, as per floor plan. Our guests were loved the venue grounds/facilities and the overall wedding set up.

V171,Davenport House,We are so pleased we chose Davenport House for our wedding reception. Charley and the team were so helpful and thoughtful. Putting canapés behind the bar for us and making sure everything ran so smoothly. I am obsessed with the stunning house and grounds and it was absolutely perfect! Thank you so much for making our day so special!!
V171,Davenport House,"Davenport House is a STUNNING wedding venue so how could we not have it for our big day!?

The staff were exceptional! From the moment we booked through to our big day, we had an absolute blast and could not thank each member of staff enough! Special shout out to Jared (hopefully spelt right, haha!) who made sure we were fed, watered and ensured we took 5 minutes to ourselves every moment we could - Also even saved us slices of pie wedding cake before we went to bed!

Our guests have said they have never been to a wedding so spectacular, with the most amazing food and amazing staff so could not have been happier having Davenport as our venue! 🩷"
V171,Davenport House,"I just wanted to write to say a huge, enormous thank you to Charley and all the team at Davenport House. We still can’t believe how perfect our day was, and lots of our guests have told us it’s the best wedding they’ve ever been to. The team were all a huge part of making that happen. It was incredibly seamless and well planned on the day, meaning we genuinely didn’t have to think about a thing, except for enjoying ourselves. The day ran to schedule perfectly and even certain touches we didn’t know or expect to happen were planned by you and the team, which made the day even more special. Thank you so much for giving us our dream wedding day. We can’t wait to see the full set of pictures and the video now to relive it all!"
V171,Davenport House,"Without doubt the best day of our lives. From start to finish, Davenport has exceeded expectations. From the very first impression of the venue during the open day, the incredible food tasting evening, all the way through to the day itself, including the support and preparation leading up to it. It was really important to us to pick a venue that not only ticked the fairytale box, but also come with the complete support of a wedding planner, due to our busy jobs. We were lucky enough to have Charley as ours. She really took the time to listen and get to know us, to ensure the day was tailored to exactly what we wanted. We even had our own cocktail designed, which went down an absolute storm on the day! She considered every little detail, constantly putting our minds at ease, which made the whole process so easy and enjoyable. Honestly the day couldn’t have gone smoother, any anxiety or stress faded immediately as soon as we got to the venue. It was simply perfect. So many of our guests were complimentary of just how beautiful the venue is and just how well organised the day was, and that is the perfect way to summarise Davenport. Any prospective couples thinking of selecting Davenport as their venue, hesitate no further. It will be a day you never knew was possible! We cannot thank you enough Charley and the Davenport team, if only we could live the day over and over again"
V171,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was amazing. When looking for a venue we weren't just looking for something wow, we needed to have people who were enthused and passionate about their work - we found that at Davenport House.

From our first phone call & meeting with Lizzie and Tallulah, we knew this was the place for us. Having two brides wasn’t an issue; combining British, Asian and Spanish cultures - wasn't an issue; having brides enter together – wasn’t an issue. Nothing was an issue. At Davenport House, we got it all – a picturesque venue and the best team of staff anyone could ever wish for. All our external suppliers have commented what a fantastic venue you are. All out guests have said that the service and attention to detail was second to none. The thoughtful touches like hiring a Spanish speaking waiter for the table which spoke very little English ensured that everyone felt welcomed. Guests with dietary requirements didn't feel they got a second rate meal or they were an afterthought - the food for all throughout the day was exceptional. The rooms / cottages where our guests and we stayed, spotless and comfortable. The thought behind adding some cheese and Spanish ham to the morning breakfast - so sweet!

Special shout out to Megan - wedding planner extraordinaire who kept in touch throughout the planning process and was exceptional on the day. Ian who worked tirelessly to ensure the day ran smoothly and the food was perfect, Charley who was also in charge of one bride and ensuring that everything was on point. All the staff were fantastic - polite, professional and personal.

Everyone keeps saying that this was the best wedding they have ever attended and that’s a lot of weddings between people! When we asked why, they say things like ‘the venue’, ‘the staff’, but it all came back to the inclusivity, love & joy that they felt – and you were all a part of that.

Davenport House is a stunning venue made even better by those who work there. If you want the whole package on your wedding day, we strongly recommend you book them.

Thank you to the entire Davenport House team.

V171,Davenport House,"Where to begin with our beautiful venue and thanking the people who made it all happen! We got married in November at Davenport House and it was easily the best day of our lives. We chose Davenport because we wanted to host our cosy winter wedding in a big grand house in the country, with all the grandeur and class but to still feel like an intimate celebration with our family and closest friends, and it was perfect in delivering just that. It is utterly beautiful, the location was perfect and exactly what we wanted. The food was absolutely AMAZING, we had so many compliments from our guests and we are so grateful for the team in delivering such a fabulous wedding breakfast. Thank you so much to Lizzie who couldn’t do more to help us have our dream day, and Ian who delivered the best service to us and our guests (the pizza at 2am was very much appreciated)

Massive massive thank you to Charley our wedding planner, who was so so helpful throughout our wedding planning process and on the day, I can’t thank her enough. She was always there whenever I needed her, helped me so much with creating our dream day and I will be forever grateful to her for keeping me sane! Whenever I had any worries I knew she was just a phone call away, which helped me a lot when planning a wedding!

Charley, Lizzie and Ian thank you for everything - best team ever. Our day was seamless and it was all down to you and your incredible team.

Jess and Sam xx"
V171,Davenport House,"Me and my (now) wife chose Davenport House as our wedding venue in mid 2022, to get married in September 2023, and it was the best decision we could have made. We looked at a range of Georgian style manor house type venues located in Cheshire, North Wales and the West Midlands areas. It blew all of the competition away in terms of the venue aesthetics, the balance in design (i.e. period characteristics vs modern design), the impressive condition of the property for its age plus what it offered for our wedding weekend.

Staff and service - In the UK, this is usually something that is average at best - if you're lucky. At Davenport House, the service from all staff was 10/10. I honestly don't think we've ever had better service for anything. We had a wedding planner from the start (Megan), who was an absolute saint and was fundamental in making the whole wedding a success. She was also instrumental in helping us find a way for our 'little' dog Bernie to be a part of the main event. Thanks Megan!

Accommodation - The fantastic condition, design and decor for Davenport House extends to all areas of the estate. The rooms are fantastic, very big, well maintained and cleaned religiously by the venue. We had no issues or problems from all of the guests who stayed onsite over the 3 days.

Food and drink - This got a lot of deserved praise from the guests too. We got to tailor our entire menu and it worked perfectly for what we wanted for the 3 days. The oyster bar and luxurious charcuterie board went down particularly well the day before the wedding.

I could keep writing much, much more on how fantastic this venue was for our wedding. But the best advice I could give for any interested couples is to go and visit it in person and reach out to Davenport House with any questions. Our own wedding ended up becoming both perfect and the best wedding we've ever been to. Thanks guys again!"
V171,Davenport House,"Fantastic location.
Great staff.
Beautiful place to get married.
I can wait to film here again soon thanks for having me."
V171,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was a fairytale, everything we could have dreamed of and more. Lizzie and Charley were fantastic in their support, organisation and professionalism in planning our wedding. The venue is simply spectacular- breathtaking. Our guests were blown away. The day ran so smoothly it was simply perfect. The food was out of this world our guests couldn't get enough. All the staff at the house went above and beyond to ensure we were happy and having a great day. The team were also extremely supportive of last minute changes/additions. The Davenport experience was truly wonderful and I'm sad to see it end right from our initial meetings, food tasting and finally our special day. Thank you: Lizzie, Charley, Ian and all of the team for a truly memorable day for us and our guests. Mr and Mrs Kissane"
V171,Davenport House,"We got married at Davenport House in February and they provided us with the most perfect day. Lizzie, Charley, Ian and the rest of the team were the best hosts we could have hoped for. Nothing was too much to ask and the guests all commented on the hospitality shown to them. The setting is utterly gorgeous, our weather was less than favourable so we did not make the most of the grounds but this didn't matter, the house was setting enough and so atmospheric! The food was utterly AMAZING and better than most restaurant food I have eaten. The venue feels intimate and grand at the same time.
I literally cannot recommend this place enough, they gave us the wedding we had always wanted and more!"

V173,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge on 12 May 2023 and it was incredible. The views are gorgeous and the photo opportunities are endless with beautiful floral and green surroundings. The team were super responsive throughout the process which is really reassuring and helpful when planning a wedding, and Nelson who ran the day was just fantastic. Every single detail was thought of and they run a really slick operation. This is essential as it meant I had a lot less to think about! They put me and my partner at ease throughout. The food and service on the day was fantastic, so many of our guests said this was the best food they’ve ever had at a wedding. Highly recommend! (Photos by Costa Weddings UK)"
V173,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","Pembroke where super helpful and provided a lot of guidance in helpful forms and layouts. Always available for a call and very helpful. on the day, it ran super smooth and and staff where lovely. Thank yo for making it a great day!"
V173,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge in October 2024. The whole day was magical, including the beautiful view over the autumn trees in Richmond Park. Robert made sure everything ran perfectly and helped us to find slots in the busy wedding timetable to fit in some special moments to also reflect traditions from my husband's Dutch culture. The food was great and the staff were polite and fun. All preparation with Lucy was also smooth and done with a smile. The Pembroke Lodge team ooze experience but make every wedding feel special and really listen to your wishes for the day. Highly recommend! Thank you to the whole Pembroke Lodge team, especially Robert, Lucy, the kitchen team and the staff on the day!"
V173,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park",The staff has been very helpful. They have a lot of experience. Open to any suggestions and help in critical situations.
V173,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue than Pembroke Lodge for our summer wedding. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most gorgeous backdrop for our special day. A huge thank you to our banqueting manager, Nelson, who went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly.

The team was incredibly supportive and accommodating throughout the planning process, making it an enjoyable and stress-free experience. Their professionalism and attention to detail made all the difference, and we’re so grateful for everything they did to make our day unforgettable. Highly recommend!"
V173,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We got married on the 3rd of October this year, and the team made our day magical! What a smooth day. We loved every second of it! The guests loved everything, and raved about the food and organisation.
Hiring Pembroke Lodge was easy. We had a viewing where all information was shared in detail and super clear to understand and make a decision.
On the months leading up to the big day our contact was Alice. Alice is a star. Responsive, professional, and had answers and solutions to everything.
On the day, Nelson coordinated the whole thing, minute by minute, and we are forever grateful for his politeness, professionalism and high spirits. We felt safe and in good hands. I would give Pembroke Lodge way over 5 stars if I could :)"
V173,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","My wedding went without a hitch, thanks to the amazing team at Pembroke Lodge (special thanks to Nicola & Robert)! They made sure everything was set up perfectly on the day, exactly in the way we had requested, and then ensured the day itself went as smoothly as we could've hoped. Everything looked beautiful and the stunning views made all of our guests fall in love with the venue too."
V173,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had the most perfect day. The team have all been so responsive and accommodating of our every request. The venue is beautiful and we were lucky to have gorgeous sunset views. It is truly a countryside wedding but conveniently close to London, which was important for our overseas guests. The food was fantastic and staff were professional and efficient. Would recommend to anyone."
V173,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We recently had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge, and I cannot say enough good things about the venue, the team and manager, Robert. From the moment we started planning to the big day itself, he was absolutely incredible.

Robert went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. He was always available to answer our questions, offer solutions, and provide creative suggestions that enhanced our vision. He coordinated effortlessly with our vendors, making sure everyone was on the same page, which took so much stress off our shoulders.

On the day of the wedding, he was a true rockstar! He made sure the timeline flowed perfectly, from setting up the ceremony space to ensuring the reception transitions were seamless. His dedication and hands-on approach allowed us to enjoy every moment without worrying about a single thing.

Our wedding was a dream come true, and we owe so much of that to him and the team! Thank you, for everything you all did to make our day magical."
V173,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We could not have wished for a better wedding venue for our special day! Everyone went above and beyond to make sure our day goes perfectly without us having to worry about a single thing! A big shoutout to Nelson who was absolutely brilliant and made the day feel so calm and well thought through.

The food was delicious and all the team was so welcoming and super helpful on the day.

Thank you so much, we really really appreciate all the help!"
V174,The Hackney,"If you are having a wedding for under 60 people then this is your place! From start to finish the communication and planning of the wedding was seamless and took so much of the stress out of the day. The totally customisable packages that they offer really does suit anyone’s budget and more importantly regardless of what package you end up going for it is value for money. The food was delicious and it catered to everyone’s tastes including a pregnant guest, halal, vegan and lactose intolerant and was the talking point for our guests. The venue itself is stunning! Lots of exposed brick, they had recently redecorated before our wedding and the reception room that doubled up as the dance floor was styled simply but made a statement and the outdoor covered patio area was a welcome addition. The team understood our vision from the get go and they completely nailed it, all of our guests couldn’t believe it was here! I honestly can’t recommend it enough if you’re wanting a small and intimate wedding venue but still with all the class. I would say to future couples even if you think this wouldn’t be your venue please please do have a proper look because it will change your mind, I had come across this venue multiple times over the course of a year and decided to take a leap of faith and give it a chance and we’re so happy we did."
V174,The Hackney,"We can’t recommend the Hackney highly enough. They made the whole process so easy and they offer so much in-house which we took advantage of. The food was especially great - our guests were amazed “best food I’ve ever had at a wedding” and the team took great care of us during the planning stages.

They offer a very customisable service with scalable pricing. If you’re having a fairly small wedding (under 60) then you must check out The Hackney.

We had such a perfect day and we owe so much of that to the fabulous venue. Beautiful space, so professionally run."
V174,The Hackney,"We had such a brilliant experience working with the team at The Hackney. We were regularly in touch throughout the planning process and the use of the shared spreadsheet was especially handy for keeping everyone informed.
We had to postpone our wedding two days before as we were both sick with COVID, and the team were just fantastic. They waited for us to recover and then we started to talk through options again. We were able to rebook just six months after our original date, and the team were accomodating and understanding throughout the process.
The day itself was perfect. Lots of our guests commented on the quality and quantity of the food and Hugo was great at keeping everything to time. We wish we could do it all again."
V174,The Hackney,"We had our wedding reception here and wow was it amazing. Hugo, Erika and the whole team were amazing. Every single guest commented on how delicious and plentiful the food was. The staff were amazing nothing was too much to ask and all so happy.
The venue itself was decorated amazingly, given we left our wedding stationary etc up to the venue it exceeded our expectations. I was concerned about the allowed decibel level for Dj / entertainment but it was plenty loud enough. I wish I could relive the day again, if you’re thinking about booking The Hackney do it! You will not regret!"
V174,The Hackney,"We held our wedding reception at The Hackney in July and it was truly the best experience. We opted for a standing reception for our 65 guests, serving food bowl-style for a more relaxed, less formal feel. The food was absolutely delicious and there was lots of it - it just kept coming! Our guests are still raving about how good the food was months later! Lots of good drinks options too - we especially like the cocktails here!

The staff on the night were so friendly, welcoming and were amazing with our children guests too!

The Hackney is such an aesthetic venue with exposed brick walls and existing foliage which we loved, so we kept additional decorations to a minimum. We dropped our decorations to The Hackney the day before and picked them up the day after, which was super easy! We hadn’t given them too much direction with where we wanted everything placed but when we turned up to the venue on the day it was truly perfect! The staff know exactly what they’re doing and had decorated it beautifully! The outdoor seating area is a great feature too (especially for our two greyhounds who chilled out there for the majority of the reception!)

We opted for a simple Spotify playlist for our music and their sound system was good.

The wedding planning process was super easy from start to finish, with continued support and check-ins from Hugo, from the moment we booked, to the day itself! We really enjoyed the menu tasting experience earlier in the year too, which is a great touch in the build up to the big day! The planning spreadsheet was easy to use and made us feel content and relaxed, knowing that everything was under control.

Overall, we would highly recommend The Hackney to anyone looking for an affordable, dog-friendly, wedding reception venue with a laidback vibe, delicious food and lovely friendly staff! We look forward to coming back every year to celebrate our anniversary, with an espresso martini!"
V174,The Hackney,"We hosted our wedding reception with the team at the hackney in May 2023. The planning experience was straight forward and easy to book. The availability for the venue is on the website so easy to see when they have and get it booked. We went with the 5 canapés, bowl food menu, and drinks on arrival with wine through the event. The staff were brilliant and food delicious.

We loved the vibe of the venue as we wanted a bit more of a casual event, with a relaxed feel and we were able to host our 85 guests with no issues (although limited to standing event at this size, there is enough scattered seating for anyone to sit when they wanted).

In terms of decorating, we didn't feel the need to add any extra flowers as the venue was already so made up with plants and other decorations.

We did add the photo box which I highly recommend, was great fun for our friends and family and came with a memory book. People were shy at first but really got into it. We also used the recommended baker who provided a delicious cake.

Final area to mention - pricing. Wedding venues can be really expensive and daunting before you even start paying for any food or drink. Something that really attracted us to this venue was the low spacing cost and the minimum spend with it. It meant that we were able to completely customise the experience and see where the money we were spending was going. There are many different options and packages to go with, so it's up to you.

Only thing that wasn't offered was any tasting of the food beforehand which we would've liked to have done but none the less, the food was delicious so it wasn't really needed!

To finish, we loved every moment of it and hope that many others get to experience the same. Thank you very much team at the hackney!"
V174,The Hackney,"We had our reception in July. The venue was cosy and comfortably fit 30 people without feeling too crowded or too empty (we were worried it might be too empty). We managed to fit a band in, arranged mini-golf in the venue after dinner, and customize the cocktail menu with custom recipe (that we provided before hand).

One of the biggest highlights was the food. The crispy roast pork got so many complements and indeed it was tasty. But really, all the dishes were amazing (we had a tasting session prior), it was hard to choose, but the taste of each dish was still top notch on the day itself too. I heard that the supper snacks we ordered were great too but alas, I was too busy and they were snapped up instantly!

Some other details:
* We were allowed to use the small room downstairs as a private space to put our stuff. Very handy to not mess up items.
* We went with a bar tab and kept increasing the budget each time till the end of the night instead of the all-you-can-drink. From our rough calculations, it worked out about the same going for all-you-can-drink. Of course, certain folk were heavy weights and more than made it up will be different for each crowd.
* Lighting for photos came out excellent (combination of photographer and venue lighting).
* You can adjust air conditioning to suit the weather (we had ours on the warm side due to older folk not dealing with cold too well).
* Outdoor space was a pleasant change in atmosphere for those who wanted some fresh air.

What about the review from the Bride? Bride approved this review."
V174,The Hackney,"The day was fabulous - Hugo was brilliant and flexible with what we were after. The tasting day before was such a great idea and the whole experience and guidance given made planning a wedding in c.5 months so much easier. We had vegans, last minute drop outs, ridiculously hot weather, about 3 different spotify playlists, a string quartet, florists arriving in the morning and a cake that arrived the day before - the team took it all in their stride and it seemed like a breeze. Loved it all and we've had such good feedback from guests. A fabulous whirlwind.

Two very minor points for feedback - we maxed out the guest numbers (the team did advise us against it but were very accommodating despite us also throwing musicians into the mix) and it was a little too crowded pre-lunch on such a hot day. We also put some speeches in between courses (again, we were recommended against it) and that may have been a slight mistake for the dessert timings, as the tasting day was 10/10. But, it was a perfect day in a stunning venue. Loved it - thank you guys."
V174,The Hackney,"Jon and the team were absolute superstars, hosting the perfect wedding day for us. The space is beautiful, the decor is modern and perfect. They were so accommodating for any request or question we had which we really appreciated. Guests commented on how great the cocktails were! The day ran so smoothly and we had a fantastic time."
V174,The Hackney,"From the initial phonecall to the warm welcome we got when we first visited The Hackney, we knew we were in safe hands and that we’d made the perfect choice. The venue offers the most beautiful interiors - the perfect mix of cosy, intimate and modern industrial - exactly what we were looking for!

Our entire experience with The Hackney was an absolute dream -we loved the mega organised approach to planning. Something that could have been incredibly intimidating was made so straightforward with the amazing support of Hugo the General Manager who embraced all our weird and wonderful suggestions and gave expert advice on what we could do to make things even better. We left every meeting buzzing with ideas and even more excited to welcome our closest friends and family to the big day.

The quality of the food and drinks is impeccable - every single one of our guests (even the fussiest!) has commented on how much they loved it. We absolutely loved the menu tasting, even though it made the decision even harder as everything was amazing. What makes it even better for us is living close by and being able to pop into our wedding venue for a coffee or a cocktail!

I couldn't recommend The Hackney enough - I just wish we could go back and do it all again!"
V175,PYRÁ,"We held our wedding reception at Pyra. We booked the entire venue, with the upstairs loft serving as a dance floor with bar and downstairs having tables and seating for guests.  Canapes were served upstairs and a buffet dinner was served downstairs.  We lucked out with great April weather, so guests were also able to enjoy Pyra’s patio and additional space on Lonsdale Road. We were very happy with our decision to have our reception at Pyra, and many of our guests commented on how lovely the space was, how nice the staff were, and how delicious the food was.
 
The venue:
The space is gorgeous with lots of natural light upstairs.  Guests arrived at 4pm but we had the venue for the entire day, and Pyra gave our florist access earlier to set up beautiful flower arrangements and candles - it looked stunning.  Pyra set up our welcome sign and card box too. The venue also accepted delivery of our cake on the morning of the wedding which was a huge help, set it up very nicely upstairs, and cut it for us after the formal “cake cutting” shots.  We were able to coordinate with Pyra ahead of time to arrange the space how we wanted, such as how many tables we wanted downstairs and the set-up of the loft upstairs.  They even had a microphone ready for us upstairs so we could say a few words to our guests before our cake cutting. Perfect! For the evening dancing, we were able to set the disco lighting to our colour scheme, which worked really well with candles and foliage (latter 2 provided by our florist).
 
The food:
The buffet dinner was fantastic.  Pyra gave us multiple menu items to choose from and we were able to fix a nice menu that took into account guests’ dietary restrictions.  We initially booked the venue when it had a different chef and menu.  We came in a few months before our wedding to try the new menu – our dinner was delicious then and there was no dip in quality for the buffet-style served at our reception. Fionn worked with us how to plan best - because we wanted a relaxed style with a dance floor upstairs, we ended up feeding our 80 guests in two sittings downstairs, which worked perfectly. The upstairs space can seat 60 people, which didn’t work for how we planned our event, but does look really nice in photos. The late night food served around 10pm also went down very well.
 
The staff:
The staff, including the bartenders and waiters, were hardworking, friendly and very nice to guests.  Enough staff were around that guests never had to wait long for drinks.  Members of staff cut our cake for us and also boxed up the late night food for guests to bring home.  Fionn, the day-of coordinator, was on-site for our entire reception and was very helpful, even helping coordinate our midnight bus arrival.
 
Responsiveness:
Overall we were happy with the responsiveness of the venue.  It took a little while to nail down the final details of the food menu and drinks menu/bar tab but we were ultimately very happy with the result.  As the venue hosts more weddings/ larger-scale events we’d expect this will improve.

Overall:
We highly recommend Pyra for a wedding reception. We had 80 guests in total, which worked very well for the canapes/cocktail hour upstairs (4-6pm), sit-down buffet downstairs (6-8pm, split into two seatings) and dancing upstairs (8pm-midnight).  The upstairs loft was able to fit all 80 guests plus a four-piece band.  Lonsdale Road is also a charming street that provided great photo opportunities.  We looked into several other venues, and came away happy with Pyra's quote – we were able to book the venue, food (including canapes, dinner and late night food) and a generous bar tab for roughly the amount some other London venues were charging for just their space (no food or drink included). We and our guests had a fantastic time. Thanks so much to Fionn and the Pyra team :)"
V175,PYRÁ,"We had our wedding celebration at Lula. We booked the loft and restaurant for this.

Positives:
The venue is beautiful and needs minimal decoration.
The food was amazing; the chef is truly professional and everyone loved it.
They redecorated the restaurant section and added a set of couches to make it a lounge, which was beautiful.
The staff was very hardworking, professional, and lovely.

They provided us with a lounge, a wedding breakfast space and a dance floor.

Flexibility with Cake:
The bakery was scheduled to deliver and set up the cake at 16:45, but they delivered it at 09:45 instead. The Lula team handled the situation professionally by storing the cake and setting it up at the correct time. They presented the cake beautifully and assisted in cutting it into nice pieces. It could not have been more perfect.


The list of available drinks was huge, and they were happy to make custom drinks and bring in different juices if requested in advance. The event manager tried to accommodate every wish we had, and on the day we could not have hoped for more. Most of our guests said it was one of the best weddings and most beautiful venues they had ever been to.

Negatives:
Food tasting for the wedding menu was not included, which we had assumed would be, but it was given at a 50% discount. We had to sort out the floral decoration last minute, as they had initially suggested they would arrange it for us after providing a budget, but later said we needed to find our own. At times, they were a bit slow to respond, which made us anxious, but after communicating with them, this was resolved, and communication was very swift.

In conclusion:
Lula gave us the most beautiful wedding we could have dreamt of. We highly recommend them. The venue, the food, the service were amazing, and we could not have hoped for more."
V176,Sandon Manor,"We had such a special wedding at Sandon Manor, the team made every effort to make our day so so special and we will be forever grateful for that. A dream team! The day ran so smoothly and they worked so hard. The venue is unique with lots of different spaces which unfold throughout the day, which was perfect as our wedding fell on a wet and windy autumnal day. We would highly recommend Sandon Manor!"
V176,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor provided the perfect venue for our wedding. From the initial conversations and meetings with the team, we knew we were in safe hands and had made the right choice. They kept us informed with any events, made information a bit payments clear and reassured us with any query we had.
The accommodation was exceptional and fitted our requirements perfectly, with high quality finishing touches throughout to ensure our stay was as comfortable as possible.
The wedding venue was incredible! Our ceremony took place in the gorgeously modern barn with stunning draping and greenery. Following on, we had a blissful drinks reception which was on the expertly manicured lawn (with mini golf!) and sun-trap of a courtyard. We then moved onto our wedding breakfast which was held in the main barn, seating all of our guests comfortably with space for decor and extra details. Following from dinner, the part started and the club room came to life! This was absolutely the talking point of the day and our guests raved about how incredible it was! It managed to create a club-like atmosphere, whilst maintaining the vibe, albeit at a reduced volume, in the rest of the barn. The layout of the venue was important to us, as it ensured our guests never strayed too far, to keep the momentum of the day.
The team at Sandon worked superbly with all of vendors which ensured the day ran smoothly from set up to clearing. All of our vendors commented on how much they too loved working there.
The venue, the aesthetics, the staff, everything was perfect! We would absolutely recommend to anyone getting married."
V176,Sandon Manor,"We cannot recommend Sandon Manor enough. From the quality of the service, the helpfulness and friendliness of the team, the beautiful accommodation and the most amazing venue which all or guests loved partying the night away in. To make it even more special the Manor is in amazing grounds in beautiful countryside and nature reserves.
Sandon Manor made our dream come true."
V176,Sandon Manor,"I couldn't recommend Sandon Manor highly enough - from our first enquiry to our Wedding, nothing was too much trouble. The team are so friendly and easy to communicate with, very approachable and responsive. They respond to any questions immediately and having the day before to set up with Tom was fantastic. Styaying in the Manor House and Dovecote was the icing on the cake as to be with friends and family the night before and the day after was so fabulous. On the day Tom and the team were absolutely fantastic and couldn't have done more to make our special day. We couldn't have dreamt of anywhere more perfect than Sandon Manor - a huge thank you to all the staff."
V176,Sandon Manor,"If you are considering Sandon Manor for your wedding venue, I beg you: scratch it off your list now. Yes, the house and grounds are beautiful, but the people behind it are absolutely awful. They ruined our wedding experience.

I will get straight to it. Sandon Manor has a very strict policy on guests leaving the site by 11:30pm (and no one is allowed back to the Manor unless they’re official guests staying overnight). We had lots of international guests at our wedding. Many hadn’t seen each other in years and would be jetlagged - we thought they may be keen to continue chatting after 11:30pm. With this in mind, we made a booking with Sandon Village Hall via our contacts at the church (where we were attending services and later married). They granted us access to the village hall until 1am as a contingency spill over space.

We mentioned this in passing during our online meeting with one of the Sandon Manor team a month before our wedding. Within hours, I received a voicemail from the lady in charge of Village Hall bookings saying (quote) “someone at Sandon Manor is trying to throw a spanner into the works for you”. It soon transpired that they had raised an official complaint to the parish council and pressurised the village hall team into cancelling our booking. To be clear, Sandon village Hall and Sandon Manor are entirely separate entities – there is no crossover between them whatsoever, as the owner of Sandon Manor later acknowledged.

It gets worse. Gob smacked, we asked Kate – the owner of Sandon Manor – for a call to find out what was going on. She was abhorrent, trying to justify her meddling as a necessary measure to protect her wedding license (side note: with Sandon Manor it is always about the money – once your deposit is paid they care nothing for your ‘special day’; you are just another cash cow). Did she apologise for stabbing us, her clients, in the back? No, she did not. She could not even fathom how hurt we were by being completely bypassed in the communication chain and how deceitful and disrespectful this was. My husband and I were quite literally left speechless. We’ve never experienced this sort of treatment from anyone, let alone our wedding venue - to whom we were paying many thousands of pounds. Dealing with this stress in the final month of wedding prep really took its toll on us and soured things. We no longer looked forward to our day, rather dreaded what Sandon Manor might do next.

Aside from this major incident, there were many other occasions when Sandon Manor were unhelpful and unfeeling in their interactions with us:

- We enquired if it would be possible to arrange a large pizza takeaway order instead of using Sandon Manor’s caterer for our late night food. One of the team explained on a call that this wasn’t contractually possible; we acknowledged this. We then received an email saying ‘If you are unable to follow this or any other of our T&C's we would be happy to cancel your booking.’ This was less than a month before our wedding.
- We had a harpist perform in the church. We were told she wasn’t allowed to play during our drinks reception in the grounds due to potential noise complaints (an acoustic harp at 2pm in the afternoon). No other music was permitted outside the house.
- Sandon Manor is an incredibly expensive (in hindsight, grossly overpriced) venue. But we were also hit with hidden fees when booking their accommodation option - an extra £425 ‘cleaning fee’ was added to our bill.
- At the time of booking, Sandon was running a promotion waivering the £700 fee for hiring their ceremony space. As we were marrying at the church, we asked if it would please be possible to put this towards other elements of our day i.e. using their festoon string of lights in the barn (for which they charge £450). They refused.
- We were unsure about booking the 1-bed Dovecote on the grounds as - at £499 for the weekend - it was a considerable expense. While we were deciding Sandon Manor rented it out on Air BnB (to one of our guests, which made for a very awkward conversation).

To summarise, you only get one wedding day. Kate and her team absolutely ruined ours. There are so many other lovely venues in north Hertfordshire run by decent, humane people. Please prioritise your happiness and choose wisely. I wish we had."
V176,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor is a stunning wedding venue with a great team behind it. The exclusive use of the manor for the weekend was a highlight, allowing us to relax with friends and family in the lead up to and after the big day. The Sandon team were brilliant, guiding us through the planning process and ensuring everything ran smoothly on the day. We couldn't have asked for a better place and team to help us celebrate our big day."
V176,Sandon Manor,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our special day. Holly, Tom and the rest of the brilliant team made us feel welcome from day one. Special mention to Tom for making the day run so seamlessly, so professional and accommodating of all our needs.

The venue itself is stunning, located in the beautiful Hertfordshire countryside. The Manor House makes for a tremendous location to prepare, and the Dovecote suite is a nice touch: a great addition for the groom to spend the last night. We loved the small details of the characteristic main venue, with the botanical feel to the bar a great backdrop to the barn.

It’s a shame we can’t stay every week!

Dan & Suzanne"
V176,Sandon Manor,"To Holly, Louise, Tom & Kate, wow, what can we say but the biggest thank you for the best day of our lives! When we viewed the beautiful venue over two years ago we just knew instantly Sandon Manor was the one, not just because it’s stunning, but you guys are amazing! Thank you for making all our wedding dreams come true. Forever grateful and can’t wait to return to reminisce. Lots of love, the new Mr & Mrs Jakes xxx"
V176,Sandon Manor,"From the moment we visited Sandon Manor we knew this would be our wedding venue for 9 September 2023. Seeing the spectacular finish of the house carry through to the completed venue just shows the high level of attention to detail this venue had to offer.

Holly, Tom and the rest of the team filled us with confidence right from our first interactions, annd went above and beyond on the wedding weekend itself to facilitate us, our suppliers and guests. The main house, dovecote, annex and extensive grounds were a wonderful way to have close family stay with us on site, and so handy to be able to all get ready nearby the morning of.

Thank you for making our wedding weekend a truly memorable occasion, for us and our families. We all look back on this day with the happiest, sunniest memories and Sandon Manor will always have a very special place in our hearts."
V176,Sandon Manor,"We had the most amazing wedding weekend at Sandon Manor.

The venue itself is the perfect backdrop for a wedding, our photos looked amazing from every single angle. There were so many spaces to make use of throughout the day which helped things to run incredibly smoothly and meant we didn’t need to have a ‘turnaround’ during the evening. The spaces really wowed our guests and created such a lovely atmosphere. Including the ‘club room’ dance floor that had our guests dancing until the very last song!

We stayed at the Manor House for the weekend, extending our wedding into a perfect weekend retreat. The house itself is beautiful, with lots of different areas for everyone to relax, and the perfect peaceful location to chill the night before the big day!

From our first viewing to checking out the day after our wedding, the Sandon staff were attentive, friendly and helped us feel relaxed and looked after throughout an otherwise overwhelming process. We’d highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for a beautiful, peaceful and unique wedding venue!"
V177,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Thank you so much to the entire team for making our wedding so special! Thanks to Donique, MJ, Mo, Harry and everyone else for helping us organise our day and for their professional but friendly attitude. Merchant Taylors is such a beautiful venue and offers a brilliant layout and different spaces to make the day so special!"
V177,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you all so very much for such an amazing wedding on Saturday. You all worked tirelessly to make it so special. Everything was truly wonderful and you all did me proud! Both Hugh and I couldn’t have asked for anything more in terms of being so well looked after. Our guests were so impressed and have given us so many compliments on a brilliantly well run event. Thank you all again for playing a brilliant part in our truly wonderful day of which we loved every minute
V177,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you so much for the most wonderful wedding reception at the end of April. We had the perfect day and our guests all commented on how well looked after they has been. Thank you again for all your hard work!
V177,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"We know this is very late (we have no excuse), but we wanted to say thank you for everything you and the team at Merchant Taylor's did for us on our wedding day. All the guests have since told us how much they loved the venue, food and service. Fingers crossed you get a few couples getting in touch! Again, Thank You for everything!"
V177,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"My brother and I attended the wedding today, as Florist's for the wedding party.
We were treated fantastically well by ALL the staff that we met, nothing was too much trouble and they made our task a COMPLETE pleasure.
If this is how they treat the actual wedding party then you will have a unforgettable time. Many thanks to all the staff for helping us to do our job with ease ."
V177,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Zara,

Can we thank you and your team at Merchant Taylor’s Hall for all your hard work in making Caroline and Neil’s recent wedding so very special. You, in particular, were able to deal with every question and request in a really professional manner.

Merchant Taylors’ Hall is part of the rich panoply of history and tradition, which makes this great City. All of our guests, and in particular those from abroad, were totally spell bound by the atmosphere, the food and service.

James was superb in organising the whole operation. To turn the Great Hall from a wedding ceremony hall to a banqueting suite for 110 guests, including flowers, place settings and dance floor in ninety minutes was truly remarkable.

The food and wine was of an amazing standard, we know that Merchant Taylors’ Hall has a reputation for presenting some of the finest dining in the City of London. You certainly surpassed all expectations.

We have many wonderful memories of the 10th September 2016, but it is best summed up by our daughter Caroline, “Can we do it all over again?”."
V178,Garden Museum,I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate everything that you did to make our party such a success last Friday. It was brilliant being outside on such a lovely everning. Everyone was very impressed with the venue.
V178,Garden Museum,"Thank you for all your help, advice and on-the-day support, it really made our wedding very special and it certianly went off without a hitch! The Museum looked amazing and the garden was perfect, especially as the sunshine adn the guests wanted to make the most of the beautiful surroundings."
V179,Clearwell Castle,"Can’t tell you how wonderful the team were at Clearwell. Our wedding coordinator Phaedra was exceptional. Attention to detail and everyone of the team from front of house, waiting staff, groundsmen and the DJ made our day absolutely everything we dreamed of and unique to us.

Can’t recommend highly enough and cost was outstanding value for money.

So many our guest commented on the quality of the food and that it was the best wedding they had been too! The children loved the magic of the castle and opportunity to get outside and see the grounds.

The grooms family had a fabulous time staying in the cottages the night before and our guests at both the Castle & the Wyndham had a fabulous stay on the night of the wedding.

Wish we could do it all again!"
V179,Clearwell Castle,We had our wedding at Clearwell in June and we couldn’t recommend it highly enough. From start to finish everything was perfect and they went above and beyond to ensure we had an amazing day. I’d not hesitate in recommending them to any couples. Just a gorgeous place with staff that really care in making your day all that you hope it will be.
V179,Clearwell Castle,"From the moment we first visited Clearwell, we knew this was the venue for us. From the moment we started planning to the final touches on the day, all the staff were fantastic. Ann, our wedding coordinator, was a delight to work with throughout. Nothing was too much trouble and she kept us updated throughout. The day was tailored exactly to our needs and when we arrived at the venue on the day they had prepared everything perfectly.

We did the night before package which included rooms and food the evening before. We were supplied with so much food no one went hungry. The rooms in the Wyndham and the Castle are fantastically appointed.

The venue itself is gorgeous. The cellar bar downstairs adds a whole different dimension to the occasion where you can really let your hair down.

This was an absolute dream come true venue for us. We loved every single minute."
V179,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot fault this venue at all. We initially had to change our wedding date because of lockdown and they were so supportive and empathetic.
Ann, our coordinator, is quite possibly the loveliest person on the planet. She was always happy to answer any questions and it never felt like we were being a nuisances or asking a silly question.
On the morning of the wedding she was a lovely calm presence and the whole day just ran like clockwork.
The food was out of this world with many guests saying it was the best food they’d had at a wedding and one person actually thought we’d hired a Michellin Chef!
The venue is so so beautiful with plenty of space. The downstairs cellar was a great place to party the night away, it was like an exclusive nightclub. There were lots of quieter rooms for people who wanted some peace.
The DJ was brilliant, we forgot to give a list of songs we liked but he did a great job of guessing what we liked ( he must’ve looked at our age and figured nineties dance music was our era. And he was bang on the money)
I do not have a single complaint about this venue"
V179,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot speak highly enough about Clearwell Castle as a wedding venue. The venue itself is absolutely stunning. It rained on our wedding day but the indoor space was so vast and beautiful that ourselves and our guests still had the most amazing time! Our wedding co-ordinator, Phaedra, was absolutely incredible, both before and during the wedding. She was always so professional, replied to all of my emails (there were many) and answered all queries efficiently. On the day, we genuinely could not have managed without her. The day flowed so well with her guidance and it really helped me as the Bride as I felt I didn't need to worry about anything! All the other staff at Clearwell and at the Wyndham hotel were also so wonderful! Everyone worked so hard and every member of staff was so kind to us; it just made our day incredibly special and we are so appreciative to them all. The food was great, service very quick and all the guests really enjoyed it! We had so many compliments about the staff and venue! I honestly could not recommend Clearwell castle more as a wedding venue!"
V179,Clearwell Castle,"Our wedding on 10/11/23 was just the absolute perfect day from start to finish. Our wedding planner manager, Hannah, was incredible, not just on the day but throughout the whole planning process. She ensured everything ran smoothly on the day, sparing no details ensuring everything was just perfect and to time but without being stressful. She was very accommodating with the planning meetings working around both mine and my now Husband's shift patterns.
We both stayed the night before our wedding and the night of the wedding with many of our guests travelling a distance so also staying in the Wyndham which was very convenient. Staying in Keepers cottage with the Bridesmaids the night before added to the experience with the added feature of the hot tub, the groomsmen were very jealous. The beds were very comfortable and everyone was excited to stay in a castle.
On the day of the wedding, the staff were very accommodating moving the bridal party along to the bridal suite to finish preparations earlier than originally planned. The breakfast provided was the perfect amount for a busy morning getting ready. Everything, including the gardens, were immaculately kept adding to the WOW factor of getting married in a Castle.
The canapes served and welcome drinks were well received by the guests and ourselves whilst we had photographers prior to the wedding breakfast. The food was phenomenal and great portions and I was stuffed after. The staff were very accommodating for us with a lot of people with allergies, dislikes of mushrooms so adapting the menu for these individual people. We were even able to swap out a few bottles of wine included in our package for cocktails as us as the Bride and Groom did not drink wine.
As soon as we walked in the venue the first time, we knew it was the place we wanted to get married. Everytime we went back to view the venue again I fell more and more in love. For anyone thinking about viewing or even booking this incredible venue I would say do it! We will be going back for events in the future to relive the best day of our lives."
V179,Clearwell Castle,"We got married at Clearwell castle April 2023. What can I say it's the most perfect venue and we had the most amazing day. The organisation was amazing and the staff were great on the day and even leading up to the big day. Phaedra was our wedding planner and communication with her was great throughout and on our wedding day she ensured that it all ran smoothly. I cannot recommend Clearwell castle and their staff enough. Thank you again for helping us have our dream wedding.
Kind regards

Vanessa & David x"
V179,Clearwell Castle,"We had the most amazing wedding day on the 24th of November 2023, the whole day ran so smoothly and all our guests absolutely loved the venue. The food was amazing and our guests loved the fish and chip buffet in the evening! The whole progress of planning the wedding was so straight forward and Phedera was a great wedding manager."
V179,Clearwell Castle,"Clearwell Castle exceeded all our expectations for our wedding day. The moment we stepped onto the grounds, we were captivated by its timeless charm. The staff, especially Hannah, went above and beyond to make every detail perfect, ensuring a seamless and stress-free experience. The Ball Room, where we exchanged our vows, felt like something out of a storybook. The surrounding gardens provided a stunning backdrop for photos and added to the overall enchantment of the day. Our guests were equally impressed, and many commented on the unique and romantic atmosphere. Choosing Clearwell Castle was the best decision we made for our special day; it truly felt like a fairy-tale come to life."
V179,Clearwell Castle,"We had the perfect wedding at Clearwell Castle, their team were superb in providing planning assistance from the point of our booking, guidance on all aspects of our wedding choices from registrars and suppliers, and coordination on the day of the wedding to make sure it flowed seamlessly. It was a beautiful day, and we couldn't be happier with our choice of Wedding location."
V180,Inner Temple,We got married here in 2023. Everything was perfect and the team made sure the day/food etc was just as we wanted it. Particular thanks to Priya and Eva (Pegasus) for their hard work making our wedding day and lead up so special.
V181,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"I got married at Dodford Manor in February this year. A great time was had by all and I will be recommending the venue to any friends planning weddings.

The weather was bad on the day so we didn’t get to use the outside area very much, but it didn’t matter as the inside is so lovely.

Sky was really helpful and put me at ease on the day. Questions in the lead up and on the day were answered quickly and I was made to feel like the only bride in the world!"
V181,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford was the first venue we looked at shortly after we got engaged. The staff were friendly and relaxed when we had a tour, I knew it was the place for us! I think Lydia telling my now husband that we couldn’t have fireworks due to the animals nearby but we could have a fire performer outside, sold the deal for us! I got an amazing fire performer as a surprise for my husband and the guests after we had sparklers, and it just completed an amazing day!
We heard such positive things Dodford about how professional and smooth running weddings have been from our suppliers, and you guys didn’t disappoint. You handled the day so well, we didn’t worry about a thing and just enjoyed ourselves the whole day.
We honestly had so many lovely messages and conversations after our wedding about how the venue was amazing, everything and everyone was catered for, from my 88 year old Nan, to young children who could play and enjoy the outdoors with a scoop of amazing ice cream. We honestly couldn’t have asked for a better day, we would do it again in a heartbeat if we could! Thank you for making the day so seamless! We are eternally grateful to everyone at Dodford for making our dreams come true becoming Mr and Mrs Price!"
V181,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford Manor what an incredible venue, from initial enquiry to booking, Dodford and the staff were so accommodating and well organised. Nothing was ever too much trouble, even if emails were being sent at 11pm. The day itself, wow it was absolutely incredible, as our wedding was on a budget and due to small numbers Dodford were amazing at setting out our decorations, everything was absolutely perfect and a special shout out to Kayleigh who was amazing on our wedding day. She kept us on time, always checking we were okay and just such a lovely person and really made our day perfect. Would highly recommend a Dodford to any couple due to be married they make the planning and the day an absolute dream and we want to relive it over again."
V181,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"It goes without saying that Dodford is a fab venue.... stunning set up, well maintained, clean, perfect grounds etc... but the best thing about Dodford is the team! I had super high expectations of any wedding venue I booked as I used to run a wedding venue myself (potential nightmare client 😂).... from the 1st viewing the team were fantastic. Relaxed, stress free, organised, professional, knowledgeable, flexible but mostly importantly friendly which gave me complete confidence in them delivering my perfect day.
In the run up to the big day the team are super responsive on email and phone We didn't meet our Event Manager, Lydia, until the day but I was always confident that they work as a whole team and therefore having 1 point of contact was not necessary at all.
In the day Lydia was amazing! Still relaxed and professional and the whole day ran so smoothly. Every requirement was perfect, on time, delivered exceptionally.
We had the best day, thank you to the whole team (especially Lydia!)
Vic & Tony

V181,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We honestly can’t say thank you enough for how amazing Dodford Manor Barn was, along with all the incredible staff who helped make our day truly unforgettable.

From the moment we visited, we fell in love with the beautiful landscapes, open-plan barns, and stunning large windows that flooded the space with natural light. The venue package was one of the best we saw during our search—it felt like everything we could possibly need was covered.

The team at Dodford Manor Barn were incredibly friendly and supportive throughout the entire planning process. Communication was open and consistent, which made everything feel so much more manageable and stress-free. We were even able to find all of our wonderful vendors through Dodford Manor Barn, which was a huge bonus!

As a bride who suffers from anxiety, I was unwell on the morning of the wedding. But I have to give special thanks to Kayleigh and our vendors, who were absolutely amazing and supported me through every step—they helped me feel calm, cared for, and ready to enjoy the day.

Our guests couldn’t stop talking about how stunning the venue was and how lovely the food turned out. We were also lucky enough to have sunshine all day, topped off with a beautiful sunset in the evening—it truly felt magical.

Thank you again, Dodford Manor Barn, for being such a perfect place to start our next chapter.

With love,
Carter & Emmie (24.03.2025) x"
V181,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"From the moment we booked our wedding at Dodford Manor, we knew we were in good hands—but nothing could have prepared us for just how extraordinary the experience would be. Every single detail was handled with such precision, care, and genuine warmth that it truly felt like a dream come to life.

The venue itself is breathtaking, but what made our day unforgettable was the impeccable service. The entire team operated like a well-oiled machine, making sure everything ran smoothly while keeping the atmosphere joyful and stress-free. Their attention to detail was second to none—no request was too big or too small.

We want to give a heartfelt, special shoutout to *Lydia*, our incredible Wedding Manager. From our first meeting to the final dance, she was nothing short of amazing. Lydia went above and beyond at every turn—anticipating needs before we even voiced them, coordinating flawlessly with suppliers, and offering support with a calming confidence that put us completely at ease, (apart from making me cry the second I saw her! 😂). Her passion for what she does shone through in every interaction, and our day would not have been the same without her.

Thanks to this amazing venue and its phenomenal team (especially Lydia!), we were able to truly enjoy every moment of our wedding, knowing everything was in the best possible hands. If you're considering this venue for your big day—don’t hesitate. It’s everything you hope for, and more.

We want to do it over and over!
A day we will NEVER forget!!

Thank you again and all our Love,
Mr & Mr Pargeter-Prince
Rowan & Karl xx"
V181,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We booked Dodford Manor in Feb 2024 after we viewed the space, for our wedding in March 2025. It was the only venue we viewed, but instantly fell in love with the character and variety of spaces the venue had to offer. The free corkage also really appealed to us as a great way for us to bring our own drinks at a good cost.

From start to end, the team were amazing, helping us with the planning of the day and making sure we had a great array of suppliers we could work with. The live band was a huge part of our day, and Dodford have a great mixture of acts on their supplier list.

On the day of the wedding, the groomsmen arrived at the venue to help with set up to see that our amazing event manager, Kayleigh had every single aspect of the day in hand and sorted. She sorted all table settings, decor, stationary - Everything!! Nothing was too much to ask of her and the Dodford team. The day ran impeccably well, with everything being on time and everything we asked for being sorted. Our drinks were served chilled, on time and were always around. It’s easy for venues who offer free corkage to try and limit you drinking your own drink - Not here!! There was constantly beers being topped up, wine bottles replaced and aperol spritz being taken round. Cannot fault them!

The team packed all of our bits away and ready for us to collect the next morning. We are very aware Dodford is a busy venue and wanted to make sure we wasn’t just “another wedding” but at no point was that the case. We felt like we were the one and only wedding and genuinely could not ask for more!

Thank you so so much for everything, Highly recommended!!"
V181,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We got married her a month ago today and had the most amazing day with them. Jess, Jack and the team made sure that everything ran smoothly and that they were doing everything they could for us on the day. We would 100% recommend them for anyone wishing to marry in such a beautiful setting."
V181,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We had been apprehensive booking Dodford for our reception that it was so popular in Northamptonshire that our wedding could end up looking the same as a lot of others we knew of, as we're local - but that was a ridiculous thing to worry about! The level of flexibility/customisation you get with Dodford is unmatched in our opinion; as it's such a beautiful venue to start with, you don't have to work hard to make it look good before adding in your personality as a couple!

The whole process from enquiries to final planning and the execution on the day were great. We did have a slight issue with them not inviting us to a food tasting in enough time before our wedding date (whether they forgot/we were missed off a list we don't know) but when we did raise it they invited us to a tasting at their sister venue instead (it's 2 hours away but we were available to travel thankfully). Every member of staff we encountered in our experience with Dodford were so friendly and make you feel like you are the only couple that matters for them in that moment, which we really appreciated from such a popular/busy venue. Abbie was our Event Manager on the day and provided such an elevated level of service, nothing was too much trouble and she executed our plans/vision to a tee, adding in some extra details that we loved too.

Our wedding was in December 2024, and we only had our reception at Dodford, so the ceremony barn was set up for our drinks reception with plenty of space for guests without it feeling cramped or equally like we were all rattling around in there (we had 75 guests for our reception). They don't have many photos of indoor drinks receptions in their promo so I was a little worried how it would look but the team had it set up beautifully. We also had a brass band on the mezzanine level which was really fun and festive!

What sold Dodford for us was the no daytime corkage, which meant we could really personalise our drinks reception and wedding breakfast drinks without breaking the bank. There was a slight disconnect with how and when we had requested/planned to serve some of the drinks in our planning meeting and what happened on the day, which we think may have been a slight hiccup in communication between Dodford and Jenkinsons (the caterers), but it didn't have a negative impact on our day at all!

Overall, there's a reason this is such a popular venue - it is truly perfect!"
V181,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,Dodford manor is an amazing wedding venue. From the very beginning when we first stepped into the venue to look around we fell in love. We knew we had to have our wedding there. After booking the venue we had amazing contact with the staff from booking our food tasting session. To a general email to see how our wedding planning was going. The planning meeting was well organised and we were able to talk through exactly what we wanted and no want was too big for the team.
V182,Gosfield Hall,"I never imagined my wedding would be somewhere as stunning as Gosfield hall but from the minute we saw this venue we knew it was the one for us and didn't bother viewing anymore venues as we had already made our minds up about having our wedding here! We were absolutely blown away with the natural beauty of Gosfield hall and so booked two years in advance of our wedding day! The professionalism and advice we received from Linda was super helpful and informative on the run up to our wedding as there is soo much to think about! We loved that we could have our day and evening all in one place aswell as the option weather permitting to have our wedding ceremony outside. I'm pleased to say the weather was absolutely perfect on our wedding day and we got to have our fairytale wedding outside! The package we paid for was well worth the money! Our guests were absolutely spoilt on our day and have all said it was the best wedding they've ever been too! It was amazing to have our guests stay over aswell! Jocie our wedding planner was absolutely amazing! She was sooo friendly and super accommodating and went above and beyond on our day to make it absolutely perfect with no hiccups! She even helped dress me on the day as she knew how to do up a corset dress and my mother didn't have a clue lol she made all my wedding details and decorations come to life and done such a stunning job decorating our dream venue aswell as being super supportive towards me my family and guests! The honeymoon suite is the best we've ever seen and completely took ours and our guests breaths away! Mind blowing! The food,venue,grounds,accomodation and night before accomodation were absolutely stunning and we want to thank everyone at Gosfield hall for making our day soo incredible and special and a day we and our guests will never forget! We can't wait to return to Gosfield! Thank you everyone at Gosfield what an amazing place!"
V182,Gosfield Hall,"We had previously experienced Gosfield Hall as a guest before deciding on it for our anniversary.

Our day was beautiful and went according to plan. Our guests all had great feedback about the day.

The only thing we would have changed would have been more diverse menu for the main meals."
V182,Gosfield Hall,"Gosfield hall is a beautiful location for a wedding and their packages cover all the important stuff! We didn’t have to worry about caterers, wedding coordinator or a DJ - all included! Great service, lovely food and everyone really enjoyed the day! Our coordinator Jocie was fab on the day, getting everything organised and fetching anything we needed. Couldn’t have asked for better, she knew the time line and the day flowed really smoothly!"
V182,Gosfield Hall,"We got married at Gosfield Hall and everything about it was perfect from when we arrive to view it, booking, the communication and Faye Carter our wedding Coordinator! If you want the best wedding day with no hassle, Gosfield is your place!!"
V182,Gosfield Hall,"Myself and my Wife have just got married at Gosfield Hall,
Our expensive started when we viewed the venue and we first met Linda sales manager, she welcome us in & made us feel at home, we wasn’t sure how, but she made us feel calm like this was where we was meant to be.
Once we looked around at all the venue has to offer we had already made a decision as this is such a stunning location and instantly new this was what we wanted! It was just right for us.

We did not get made to feel pressured to make any decisions immediately however we did end up booking our big say within the next few days after our visit.

Our next contact was with Ellie our wedding planner, she was very helpful and nothing was ever to much, we enjoyed the food tasting at the venue and was very impressed with the experience, it was out of this world.
Ellie helped us through all of our problems and made sure all of our plans come to life.

Now on our big day, what can I say? The staff were amazing, Ellie couldn’t have done enough every time you wanted to ask a question she was next to us any time we needed something. She was there all the way through the day/ night & even the next morning, Ellie made our day Run seamlessly.
We’ve been to many weddings before but never have we had food as amazing as we did here.
Every guest was amazed at the food quality and commented on how delicious it was!
Just to sum up if you’re thinking about booking your wedding at Gosfield Hall don’t question it just book it. You will be amazed."
V182,Gosfield Hall,"The venue is stunning and was the perfect setting for our winter wedding (so much natural light even in January). Jocie Golbourn was our assigned wedding planning specialist and she is so kind, sweet, patient and professional. All our guests loved the venue but many actually commented on how flawless and seamless the day was organised and rooms decorated and prepared from each section of the wedding and we only have Jocie and venue staff to thank for their meticulous planning and preparations. The food and drinks were delicious. Couldn’t recommend this venue enough- we actually booked the venue on a whim and were SO happy when we visited for an open day. There’s no false advertisements- it’s stunning."
V182,Gosfield Hall,"Everything, from start to finish, was exactly what we wanted and more. The preparation was helped by our wonderful personal manager, Tara, and accommodated each and every one of our requests and needs. The venue is gorgeous, food delicious, and atmosphere felt special. Our friends and family all told us that this was such a spectacular wedding for them that it was the best they've ever been to. We felt completely taken care of, kept us calm and happy throughout the day, and kept all of our suppliers in place and to standard. It felt glamourous and unique. We wish we could relive the day over and over. It really was our dream wedding."
V182,Gosfield Hall,"We got married in Gosfield Hall in May and had the most amazing wedding day that any couple could ask for. The whole experience from the arrival the night before to leaving the day after was seamlessly managed by the team at the venue.
The house and the grounds looked absolutely stunning and Ellie and the team did a brilliant job at keeping the day running smoothly without making anyone feel rushed. Everyone there was immensely friendly and helpful and we really felt that everyone who worked there was invested in making our day feel special.
We fell in love with the venue when we booked it but the whole experience exceeded out expectations so much that we wish we could do it all again!"
V182,Gosfield Hall,"I wanted to take a moment to commend and state our appreciation for Jocie. She truly was phenomenal, approachable and no task was too big.
We had 5 months to plan our wedding and we loved every moment. With us both working in the service industry it was great to have someone who was so switched on and would be an asset to have on any team."
V182,Gosfield Hall,"Having just got married at Gosfield Hall I can honestly say it was the most beautiful venue and the most perfect day. The staff were so attentive and professional. The food was outstanding and the drinks and cocktails were fabulous. They couldn’t do enough to make sure our day was everything we’d dreamt of. I have to say a special thanks to Ellie - one of the wedding coordinators on site - she went above and beyond to help us plan our day and was there from the very moment I woke up delivering fresh pastries for breakfast to the moment she made me a cup of tea to go to bed with. I can’t thank you enough Ellie, you are an absolute credit to Gosfield Hall."
V183,Kingston Estate Totnes,"When I first enquired with Kingston I thought it would be too expensive but we explained what are budget was and when we wanted to get married and they put a quote together that was affordable.
We have just had the most amazing one day wedding which didn't finish until the early hours. We got married in the Long Barn where there are chandeliers running down the middle, it was very romantic. There is this nightclub at Kingston which is very cool which everyone loved. The guests all said the venue was stunning and the food was out of this world.
A few of us stayed the night before and most of our guests stayed the night of the wedding in the cottages and barns. The staff were brilliant and they coordinated the whole day for us. I cant recommend the venue enough."
V183,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had a two day wedding at the Kingston Estate. All our guests were completely blown away by it.
Most of our friends and family had traveled far for the weekend and were not disappointed when then arrived as the cottages and barns are gorgeous. Some even have hot tubs.
Jodie and the Weddings Team organised a welcome party for the first night which was unreal along with providing street style food for everyone around 8.30 pm. At Kingston they have this really cool enormous Yurt and food hut which is used the day before the wedding and for breakfast.
On the wedding day itself we got married in the Walled Garden and there were endless canapes during the drinks reception. We then decided to eat in the Hayloft Barn which has glass windows overlooking all the gardens.
We used the clear span marquee for our reception party and had the craziest cover band before we all went into the nightclub until 3 am. The good thing about Kingston is everything is included they let you use things like cake stands, easels, knifes, speakers, microphones, all furniture at no extra cost, they set everything up for you and then clean up afterwards. We didn]t have to do anything which made everything totally stress free.

Thank you Jodie, Ellie and Charlotte it was insane !!"
V183,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had the most magical wedding at Kingston. From the moment we set foot onto the grounds, we knew it was the perfect place for our special day. It was our first viewing… and nothing else compared for us (we saw a total of 6 venues). What stood out to us the most was the variety of spaces available for each part of the day. The selection of ceremony areas, the beautiful outdoor spots for photos, the yurt for the night before party, and a special one for us… the underground nightclub for the evening! As party lovers, this was a part that sold it for us; there was somewhere for every moment.

One of the things we loved most was the flexibility to personalize every aspect of our wedding. The venue truly felt like a blank canvas that we could transform into our dream setting, but equally, we got away with doing absolutely nothing as it was beautiful all on its own.

But what truly made our experience unforgettable was the incredible staff, led by Jodie. They were not only professional and attentive but also genuinely warm and welcoming. Their support and attention to detail ensured that everything ran smoothly, allowing us to relax and fully enjoy our day.

We're hoping to return and stay in the future, for a special occasion.

It's not just a wedding venue; it's a place that holds a special spot in our hearts as the backdrop to the beginning of our happily ever after 🤍"
V183,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Kingston was perfect. Despite a rainy start, the day was amazing and Jodie was available but subtly in the background allowing the day to be ours."
V183,Kingston Estate Totnes,"After over a two and a half year wait due to Covid, our son and his wife had a wonderful wedding weekend. Jodie from Kingston Estate and her team of staff went above and beyond to ensure the wedding ran smoothly. Every detail was dealt with professionally. The accommodation, venue and food were all excellent and all our guests many from overseas had a wonderful time. The only thing Jodie could not oversee was the weather but even a little rain didn't spoil the celebrations."
V183,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue and staff were brilliant from start to finish. The venue is really multi-functional and caters for rain or shine. The weather was really unpredictable around the time of our wedding but I was a stress free bride knowing they had it in hand. The food supplier was stunning - we had a weekend package which all the guests raved about. That coupled with the unlimited drinks pages made it the perfect venue for us. A Devon treasure that feels like being on a film set - everyone loved it!
V183,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Such a beautiful venue - we loved it so much. The food was incredible and despite having a changeover of wedding planner close to the wedding day, it had no impact on our day what so ever. The venue are calm and professional and loved their approach to communication which was friendly."
V183,Kingston Estate Totnes,Fell in love with the venue on our first visit. We were particularly looking for a venue which could cater us for 3 days and sleep the majority of the the guests. The grounds were well kept especially the walled garden which is where the ceremony took place. The team were a pleasure and made the day truly special.
V183,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Our 3-day wedding celebrations were spent at the STUNNING Kingston Estate - a truly unique venue that we absolutely fell in love with. It had EVERYTHING we were looking for & more. The grounds are perfectly manicured all year round & come complete with walled garden. The cottages & main house are beautifully decorated, providing luxurious accommodation for 86 of our guests. Sarah & the team were such a pleasure to work with & couldn’t do enough for us. The catering was also top notch. Thank you"
V183,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue was great we had a few personal health issues beforehand but the team went above and beyond to make the day extra special. The wedding planner organised everything for us and they had plenty of props on site that we were free to use. We had the whole place to ourselves for the weekend it was brilliant and our friends loved the hot tub and pool.
V184,Holmewood Hall,"We were married at Holmewood Hall on 15th February 2025 and I can honestly say that it was the most magical day. We went to visit the venue and instantly fell in love with it but even we were blown away by how beautiful everything looked on the day. All of the staff were amazing - special shoutout to our personal wedding manager, Laura Pike, who was always on hand to answer any questions - she couldn’t do enough for us! The food was wonderful & we had full control over the menu. Would highly recommend this venue, you won’t regret it!"
V184,Holmewood Hall,"Holmewood Hall was an absolutely perfect wedding venue. The house is stunning, well cared for and beautifully decorated. All of the staff are so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Our Wedding Coordinator was fantastic, available from early morning of the wedding and was still there the morning after working for us. The food was excellent, drinks and canapes were amazing and the venue took care of everything for us. We had the most perfect wedding and are so pleased we chose Holmewood Hall. The Gold Room where we had our ceremony is gorgeous. Thank you for giving us a beautiful wedding!"
V184,Holmewood Hall,"I cannot fault this venue at all, the venue itself is breathtakingly beautiful with magnificent rooms and very lovingly maintained grounds. The staff are incredibly friendly, professional and efficient, our wedding coordinator Lee was a pleasure to work with and made our special day run smoothly. If you want a hassle free wedding with breathtaking grounds and the most amazing staff then this is the venue for you."
V184,Holmewood Hall,"Had the most amazing wedding here recently and cannot recommend it enough.

The venue itself is stunning and the options included in the luxe package covered everything we could've possibly wanted and made planning the wedding 100x less stressful.

The staff were all amazing from start to finish, Katie showed us around initially and then Lee was our personal wedding manager, and they were both incredible throughout. Always on hand to answer any questions and help us through the day once we got there.
We had so many comments from our guests on how lovely the staff were on the day!

A particular highlight though was the food - the tasting evening was a dream and the chef went above and beyond to provide a full vegan menu for us which wasn't limited to only a couple of options.
Again, we had so many non-vegan guests complimenting the food and saying how lovely it was!

Overall, an incredible day and an incredible venue.
Thank you so much to everyone there!"
V184,Holmewood Hall,"This place is simply just amazing 🤩
We had our wedding here on 17-12-24 and it was everything we dreamed of and more. The food, staff, decor were just perfect not forgetting the most beautiful Christmas tree 😍
Our person wedding planner Lee was an absolute god send not just having him there on the day but always being at the end of a phone to answer any questions or worry’s.
If we could go back and do it all again we would and not change a single thing.
The most perfect day at the most perfect venue ♥️"
V184,Holmewood Hall,Perfect venue for a wedding with guest numbers 60 - 100. Our guests and I moved from each room to a new room throughout the day and every room had a new surprise. The bridal suite was lush and it was great having all our guests staying under one roof. I would 100% recommend this to anyone.
V184,Holmewood Hall,"The wedding day and lead up to the day were fab. However, for the price we paid, we expected a little bit more.
I opted to use the bridal cottage the evening before for which we paid £450 extra. This is something I now regret, as there was no hot water and we were not able to order any food in as all the take away options were shut (on a Friday night). The hot tub also needed a good clean. So the night before/morning of my wedding was not ideal. I flagged this to the manager who advised that we should have raised the cold water issue as soon as possible, but seeing as we were trying to have morning showers on the wedding day, this did not leave us any time.
Our package included pre-drinks, wine with dinner and we also purchased a cocktail ""cart"" (cocktails on a table) and a bucket of beers. The groom, who is not a wine fan, asked for a beer with his wedding meal and was presented with a contactless card machine to pay for it at the top table. We felt this was a bit unnecessary as there was a full bucket of extra beers outside and it felt a little embarrassing having a card machine presented to us at the top table on our wedding day for one measly Corona, despite the huge amount we had paid. Also, guests were unknowingly allowed to buy beers from the bar after the meal, despite there being available beers to them already in a bucket next to the bar...
Overall the wedding was lovely, but for the price we paid we expected a bit better. Essentially, I loved the venue, but I wish we had not purchased any extras!"
V184,Holmewood Hall,"We got married at Holmewood Hall on 4th October 2024. From the first moment we stepped into the venue and I saw the magnificent Gold room I knew this would be the perfect place for us to get married. We had the most amazing day which was perfectly coordinated by the whole team at Holmewood but especially so by our personal wedding manager Lee. Lee was always quick to respond to any questions we had in the lead up to the day and nothing was too much trouble for him.
We honestly wish we could do it all over again as it was a magical day. We would recommend Holmewood Hall to anyone looking for the perfect venue."
V184,Holmewood Hall,"After getting engaged in late March this year we wanted to get married fairly quickly so booked Holmewood for the same September. The venue, grounds, accomodation were all stunning and we felt very fortunate it was within budget and the package we got was outstanding in comparison to other venues and what it included, which was far far more than other venues. We got to attend a luxe event to choose all our wedding food, canapés, cocktails and wines which should have made things easier but due to the unbelievable quality it made it harder! Our wedding planner Lee is literally the most fantastic person. He was flexible, fun, engaged and on absolutely everything. The day was ran impeccably and also smooth even with some weather concerns and speeches taking a bit longe than we thought. If you book here ask for Lee!! We had the most perfect day. Can’t fault a single things. Our guests all told us how incredible everything was with one even saying he will now longer not attend any further weddings unless it’s at Holmewood. Thank you to all the staff and as mentioned a huge special thank you to Lee! Your a legend!"
V184,Holmewood Hall,"Exceptional venue, stunning grounds, fantastic DJ, and excellent service. Highly recommended! Happiest day of my life 😊"
V185,Bourton Hall,"We got married at Bourton Hall on 08 March 2025 and our wedding planner was Harminder. The day was absolutely amazing from start to finish. All the food and drinks were of a high standard and presented beautifully which includes the wedding breakfast, canapés and cocktails, and breakfast the next day. The venue is gorgeous with lots of rooms, well maintained grounds and exclusive use. The staff are friendly and accommodating and the event was really well managed. We would like to particularly thank Harminder, who was supportive throughout the wedding planning process and the wedding day, ensuring things ran smoothly and in a timely manner. He is a great communicator, provided advice and guidance where needed and attention to detail. We really had a magical day! Thank you so much! We would happily do it all over again and would definitely recommend this venue!"
V185,Bourton Hall,"What a fabulous wedding venue! Because it's a wedding venue and not a hotel that holds the occasional wedding, they really focused on what was important and anticipated our every need. It's an elegant venue but with a comfortable feel to it. The team are incredibly accommodating and helpful and each couple is allocated their own personal wedding manager to guide them through the process and to make sure every detail is covered.
There's a beautiful chapel on site where non-religious ceremonies can be held - this was fabulous.
The food was plentiful and delicious - all our guests raved about it. Great choice of welcome drinks and canapes, wines and cocktails.
The grounds are gorgeous; a perfect backdrop for our October wedding.
The venue was exclusively ours and has beautiful bedrooms, including a huge, stunning bridal suite. Most of our guests stayed overnight and took advantage of the brilliant breakfast in the morning so it really extended the celebration."
V185,Bourton Hall,"Our wedding at Bourton Hall was better than we ever imagined. The Italianate mansion is truly spectacular inside and out however it is the team that made our day run perfectly. Our guests found the setting and the food incredible, they were very impressed! Our wedding planner Emily Sarjant was fantastic her knowledge and expertise made our day magical from start to finish, with all the special touches that she suggested. Our first dance was created in such a beautiful way it will be a memory we cherish forever. Thank you to Emily and the team at Bourton Hall. My husband would also like to note that the croquembouche was amazing and everyone should have one."
V185,Bourton Hall,"My wife and I got married at Bourton Hall in September, with our wedding managed by the wonderful Eleni. Everything about the day went as perfectly as we could've wished, right from arrival to departure the following day. The venue is stunning, and the food was lovely, and having 21 bedrooms on site was such a bonus so that all of our close friends and family could stay on site with us.
Bourton Hall did everything they could both in the run up to the day and on the day itself to alleviate all stress to ensure everything ran as seamlessly as possible, which it absolutely did.
We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall enough."
V185,Bourton Hall,"We were married on 28th July 2024. What an amazing day we had at Bourton Hall. Could not fault it! The venue is so elegant! The grounds and views were to die for. The food was out of this world with so many choices and all cooked and served to perfection. Accommodation / rooms were plentiful and luxurious. Lovely to have a chapel on site too. We had the whole place to ourselves, we felt like royalty! Lots of varied rooms and areas for people to choose where they wanted to be after the wedding breakfast. We would choose the venue all over again!"
V185,Bourton Hall,"We had both our wedding ceremony and reception at Bourton Hall and the service was superb throughout. The house and grounds are beautiful with amazing views to go with them. The staff were professional and helpful during the lead up to our wedding day and during the day as well - even when we had an emergency prior to the ceremony which caused delays, the venue staff were able to work around this to move timings back in order to allow all of our planned activities to go ahead and be fully enjoyed. All the food was delicious and we had a wonderful wedding day thanks to Bourton Hall."
V185,Bourton Hall,"We had the most perfect wedding day at Bourton Hall. Throughout the planning process and on the day, the team were so professional, which meant we could relax and know that everything was in their capable hands - Emily was an amazing wedding manager. The building is beautiful inside and out, and the grounds are stunning - there are so many places for beautiful photos, and views out over the countryside. The food was absolutely delicious, it was so hard to choose what to have! It was also so helpful to have so many places for guests to sit and chat in the evening, away from the disco room but still part of the action. Having so many bedrooms onsite (not to mention a stunning bridal suite!) was an added bonus. We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall highly enough, and have had so many comments from guests saying what a beautiful, elegant but relaxed day it was, so I know they really appreciated everything Bourton has to offer too. Thank you so much to Emily and the whole team for giving us such a perfect day!"
V185,Bourton Hall,"As the Bride and Groom we were made to feel like nothing was too much to ask and they couldn't do enough to make us feel special.
All the guests commented that it was one of the prettiest and most relaxed weddings they have been to.
We could not have asked for a better wedding day thanks to Bourton!"
V185,Bourton Hall,"I had my wedding on 10/02/2024 I am so happy I chose this venue, It is really magical. My wedding manager was just the best! Emily went above and beyond to help me on my big day! I cannot thank her enough.

One of the main things about this venue is that t has its own chappel which is really special and makes you wedding seem more traditional, however there are more options/ rooms available. I wanted the wow factor and I got it.

Some of the options that made it great

*Onsite accommodation for night before and night of the wedding is really helpful
*Exclusive use
*Dedicated wedding manager definate gamechanger! (Emily)
*Menu choices are fantastic.

Everyone commented on the food being really nice ( we had the lamb) The evening buffet was also great. I paid extra to have a meal created as having part of my culture within the food at the wedding was very important to me, they did not disappoint.
Emily was perfect in so many ways, she knew exactly my vision once i explained it to her and she made sure that it became real for me. She adapted parts of the day so that it would work better, for example bringing the canapes outside whilst photos where being taken. Helping me into my dress, looking after my phone just everything I needed she was there. She really worked hard to make sure it run perfectly and it did.

Thank you emily!!! You made my day Great."
V185,Bourton Hall,We got married at Bourton Hall on 30th July 2023. It was the most amazing day ever! We are still receiving compliments from our guests on how stunning the venue was and the whole running of the day. This was 100% down to our wedding co-ordinator Harminder. He went above and beyond to ensure our day was absolutely perfect. He literally could not have done any more! Thank you again Harminder!!
V186,B&H Buildings,Bourne & Hollingsworth was such an exceptional venue for our wedding this September. This is the perfect place for you if you want a true London wedding that feels like a fun dinner/house party but on an epic scale. We used the top floor (the studios) for our sit down dinner (think candle light and tasty roast lamb) and headed downstairs for our reception with the basement club (below and hidden) for late night dancing. The place is stunning (greenery and glass everywhere and the cocktails are insane but what really makes this place are the people. The whole staff from Matt and Lizzie to the bar team to the dinner crew made our whole day seamless and so fun. Could not recommend B&H more highly for your London wedding.
V186,B&H Buildings,"Beautiful wedding celebration in the most stylish venue - we had an intimate wedding reception (drinks, dinner and more drinks!) at the Bourne & Hollingsworth Buildings. The staff members on duty were excellent - nothing was too much trouble and they served everyone with such professionalism. We couldn’t recommend it highly enough and we haven’t stopped talking about it since. All of our guests were so impressed with the space and how stylish it was. The bar, restaurant and greenhouse are all aesthetically beautiful and the botanical vibes make for a very relaxed, but premium setting. Special shout out to Lizzie who helped us coordinate everything and Matt on the day who led the team. Thank you so much - we had the best day and we couldn’t have wished to host it in a better venue."
V186,B&H Buildings,"India & the B&H team were seamless. Flexible, responsive, kind, and easy to deal with. They made our day so special. The food was fantastic, the drinks were lovely, and the value for money was first rate!"
V187,Leez Priory,"I never in my life thought I would get married in a place like Leez priory! The whole experience from start to finish was just fantastic. The price breakdown was manageable and there was no pressure to take any upgrades offered. The things we got in our package were phenomenal and having a wedding planner was tremendous - our lady (Leanne) was an absolute god send!
They catered to all our needs and we were made to feel so comfortable and nothing was a problem! I’d highly suggest going to an event there before hand, just to get a feel of what it’s like full of people and enjoy their delicious food. We actually enjoyed their entertainer ( singer) so much we hired him for our wedding ☺️
Lee priory is just so beautiful. I can’t speak highly enough x"
V187,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory on the 7th of September 2024. Considering how long they have been a wedding venue, they were pretty flexible with some of the ideas we had for the venue styling that turned out amazingly!

The staff really made the day something special and couldn't have done enough for us. Special mention must be made for Leanne, our wedding planner, who was amazing!

Highly recommend the venue and the incredible team that helped to make our day so special!"
V187,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in October 2024. This venue is stunning both inside and out with immaculately kept grounds and interior. The hospitality in the lead up to and on the day of the wedding was fantastic. The food was also brilliant. Another great perk of this venue is the amount of on site accommodation.

A couple of drawbacks / experiences during our wedding. There are only a few toilets in the main building which kept blocking and overflowing throughout the evening which led to us taking some guests to the dressing room or honeymoon cottage to use the facilities. You are also restricted by the venue on any external food or drink suppliers and the venues optional extras for this are quite expensive for what they are.

That asaide, we had the best day and evening at Leez Priory and would certainly recommend it!"
V187,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in August 2024- great venue and experience from initial viewing to leaving the morning after the wedding. Leanne acted as our wedding planner and was friendly, professional and helpful throughout. We opted for the classic package and the food was amazing quality with everyone commenting how full they were!
The venue is beautiful with several options for ceremony both inside and out. Accommodation was great too. The whole day ran smoothly with perfect weather - we will have very happy memories of our day!"
V187,Leez Priory,"Perfect venue and very attentive staff, lovely food and great communication from start to finish"
V187,Leez Priory,"Stunning venue. Fantastic Team. Very accommodating toward our unique ""surprise"" strategy. Our guests were truly surprised. Thank you."
V187,Leez Priory,"Leez priory was the 1st and only venue we looked around when we started planning our wedding. From the moment we stepped on the premises, everything just looked so perfect and exactly what we wanted from a wedding venue. When we got assigned our wedding co-ordinator Rachel, she was just absolutely spot on with everything we asked for and nothing was too big an ask for her. She made sure the day ran as smoothly as possible and took care of any issue that arose without me knowing (which I am forever grateful for!!)
The rest of the staff were amazing and very helpful.

The venue itself is just absolutely stunning and we loved that it has the pub area as well as the dance floor so it catered to all of our guests.

All of the rooms were lovely and it was so nice being able to stay in the fisherman’s lodge onsite the night before the wedding.

We genuinely cannot recommend this venue enough and it was 100% worth the money! 10/10!"
V187,Leez Priory,"We got married on a Tuesday in October to maximise the value of what we could get for our money; and honestly, we got everything we wanted and more. Leanne, our Wedding Manager was perfect at bringing an attention to detail and seamless organisation to the big day, and in the lead up. There wasn't one moment of the day where we felt stressed, as Leanne had it covered. In one particular instance, our flowers for the bridal party's hair hadn't arrived. Within five minutes of telling Leanne that we needed this, the flowers were with our hair and make-up suppliers to add the finishing touches.

Leez Priory as a venue is the most stunning setting, and offers an incredible range of areas in which the ceremony and reception can take place. There is also the opportunity for the bridal party to make use of the Fisherman's Cottage the night before the wedding, and for people to stay in the on-site accommodation on the evening of the wedding, making it the perfect venue for people also travelling from further afield.

Leez Priory were very accommodating, welcoming and were happy to work with us to make our day as perfect as possible. The food was incredible, and a total hit with all of our guests, and so many people have commented on how incredible the day was as a whole. You wouldn't be disappointed to choose Leez Priory."
V187,Leez Priory,They catered to our every need. To when we would ask for things they hadn’t been done before they still made sure it went smoothly. Leanne was amazing she made me feel so comfortable from the start. The whole day was stunning. Beautiful venue please go view it as you will not be disappointed
V187,Leez Priory,We got married on the 26 May 2024. This venue was absolutely brilliant! They catered for every need and made sure there was no stress on the day. Leanne was kind and level headed throughout and was always one step ahead! Do not hesitate to book- do it now!
V188,London Rowing Club,"We picked this place because we wanted somewhere fairly central and casual. We fell in love with the long room and the view. Our wedding was in October so we thought we'd have it cosy but we ended up with a beautiful autumnal day so everyone was on the balcony. The fairy lights were perfect and the other rooms were great to avoid leaving. The staff was so friendly and accommodating that we would definitely recommend the venue.

The only thing that could have tainted the day is that after three visits and many emails, we were never told that the river floods (a lot). We were flexible with our day so if we knew this we would have built it into our day, instead, I was told by the photographer on the day as I got out of the taxi that we wouldn't be able to take any group photos because the area would be flooded during the cocktail hour and half that we had assigned as photo time. This would have been disappointing but we all ended up running outside after the ceremony to take photos before the tide came in. My husband and I borrowed wellies for our couple photos. We had fun doing this, but I can imagine many couples being upset! My friend's electric car also flooded and they were obviously upset."
V188,London Rowing Club,"Annabel was meticulous in her help planning the wedding. Very knowledgeable and helpful.
On the day the rest of the staff were brilliant - there wasn’t an empty glass in the house.
Great venue at a reasonable price on the London riverside."
V188,London Rowing Club,"LRC was the perfect place to celebrate our wedding this summer. The venue staff went above and beyond to ensure that everything went as planned both before and during the event. Thanks in particular to Annabel who was responsive, helpful and always put us at ease in the build up. The location is stunning - couldn’t have asked for a better day!"
V188,London Rowing Club,"We just wanted to say an enormous thank you for everything. From the moment we came to visit the LRC on a slightly grey January weekend, we knew it would be a fabulous venue for our June wedding reception and it certainly did not disappoint. It really is the most beautiful setting and we have very fond memories of our guests enjoying drinks in the sunshine with the most fantastic view over the Thames. The venue has such character and lends itself beautifully to a wedding reception. We have received so many compliments from our guests and I would encourage anyone thinking about booking their wedding at the LRC to do it, you will not regret it! We were lucky to be blessed with beautiful weather so were able to have our jazz musicians play on the balcony for the drinks reception before moving into the Long Room for our meal. It looked stunning with the tables dressed and mantles adorned with flowers. Following the meal and speeches, guests enjoyed drinks back on the balcony and in the Fairburn and Members Rooms which provide plenty of seating, whilst the Long Room was cleared and the band set up. We then partied the night away.

From start to finish, the organisation was so straight forward. Annabel was very accommodating and full of helpful advice in the run up. I knew that on the day she would ensure things ran like clock work, which of course they did. Our suppliers also commented on how helpful the LRC team were to work with. On the day the staff were brilliant and went out of their way to ensure everything ran smoothly (including borrowing some large gym fans from the rowers to put in the Long Room to keep us cool as it was an unexpectedly hot day). We really can’t thank you enough and now need to think of an excuse to host another party with you in the future!"
V188,London Rowing Club,"We got married in St. Mary's church and then had our reception in the London Rowing Club in February 2023. It far exceeded our expectations and was an incredible fabulous stress-free day with thanks to the wonderful Annabel making the day just run.

In the lead up to the event, Annabel was incredibly responsive, helpful and helped us plan the day exactly how we wanted it. She answered all our questions really quickly, always got back to us, was very flexible with what we could do and allowing us to personalise the space. Prior to the event, Annabel arranged for us to go and have a look around on a couple of additional occasions to help us plan how we would want it to look. She also gave our caterers a tour of the kitchens as they were new to the venue.

In the immediate lead up to the day, Annabel helped with our suppliers in getting chairs delivered and bringing all the wine over a day earlier. On the day, she helped to make the day flow and just dealt with things throughout the day.

The venue itself is beautiful with three rooms to use. A middle reception room, a cosy snug and the main long room. In the main long room, there is a rowing boat hanging upside down with fairly lights. The main lighting can be dimmed and gave a wonderful atmosphere for the evening meal. As our wedding was a winter wedding, it was fairly chilly so they lit fires in the main room and snug which added to the atmosphere.

We had around 90 guests - could have fitted a few more just about. We used the round tables, tablecloths, linen, plates cutlery and glasses provided and they were perfect for a wedding and looked very smart. No need to hire these. As mentioned, we did hire separate wedding chairs instead of the conference chairs provided. There's a lot of decoration in the way of rowing memorabilia on the walls which means you don't have to actually do too much to make it interesting for guests.

Overall, the perfect London wedding venue with absolutely fabulous views across the Thames with a long balcony to enjoy from. To top it off Annabel is truly amazing and so helpful."
V188,London Rowing Club,"We had our wedding (ceremony+reception) at LRC in July, and the venue itself and the team we worked with were absolutely incredible! Everything on the day went without a hitch and we heard so many compliments on the location - our guests loved the balcony and the layout inside, which included plenty of space for anyone wanting a break from dancing to sit down and relax. Would recommend to anyone looking to host an event!"
V188,London Rowing Club,"London Rowing Club is a truly fantastic venue and we were both so delighted with how our day went! The venue has real character with the classic rowing memorabilia and it’s location on the Thames, and looks amazing when it’s all set up. The layout and size of rooms I thought were perfect for our wedding of about 70 (+15ish more in the evenings) and of course the big attraction is the balcony which all of our guests adored!! (I wish I’d had more time during the day to stand out there and enjoy it 😂). Not only is it a fantastic venue in a great location but what really made this the most amazing venue was how great all of the staff, and all the recommend suppliers were! The day exceeded expectations and we got compliments on the place and the staff from all our guests. Couldn’t be happier with the venue, it was perfect for us!!"
V188,London Rowing Club,"We found the London Rowing Club while desperately combing through London locations after our original venue fell through a few months before the day.
Luckily for us it was available due to a cancellation - kismet!
From the start the charming Annabel put us very much at ease and helped us to envisage the day as we hoped it would be. She was very flexible and helpful throughout the planning process.
We were incredibly lucky with the weather on the day and the venue really came into its own - it was virtually impossible to get guests off the terrace, which is the perfect size for our smallish event (65 people) and of course offers gorgeous river views.
We were well looked after by the team and everything went off without a hitch. The interior of the space itself is lovely with a great sense of history.
Nice additional touch - table tennis was made available in the entry room for the later part of the evening!

It's a special place and I'd thoroughly recommend for anyone seeking a memorable spot to tie the knot!"
V188,London Rowing Club,"We got married at the London Rowing Club on a brilliantly sunny winter day on Saturday. All the way through in the run up (after 2 years or more of postponements), Annabel and team bent over backwards to help us arrange everything, recommended some brilliant suppliers for food (Shona Pollock comes highly recommended) and flowers (same with Steph the charityflorist.)

So many of our guests said how lovely the venue and staff were on the day, and the whole place looked a million dollars with an amazing photo set on and around the balcony and river - although we haven't seen those yet. The corkage and bar tariff prices are also incredibly reasonable for an inner London location!

I can't recommend the LRC highly enough. It will live in memory for a very long time."
V188,London Rowing Club,"The London Rowing Club team alongside the Dinner Ladies went above and beyond to ensure that we had the wedding perfectly fitting our requirements. Throughout the entire all of the suppliers worked seamlessly together to ensure the space transformed as we progressively added guests and transitioned between eating, our ceremony, more eating, music and dancing. We wouldn’t have had it any other way. The attention to detail of the team is second to none - perfect for any bride and groom seeking a beautiful event."
V189,The Prince Albert,"The team at The Prince Albert were always accommodating, made everything easy and stress-free, and helped us organise an amazing wedding party. They really knew what they were doing, and helped guide us through the process calmly, working around our schedule (which wasn't easy - we live abroad!) to make sure all our last-minute worries and concerns were sorted smoothly. The food was excellent, and the space was fantastic for our party. Can't recommend it highly enough!"
V189,The Prince Albert,"We had such a happy wedding with Harrison and this venue. Harrison was really flexible and answered any questions we had and made great suggestions when we needed seating arrangements, the schedule for the day, a florist, and more. The day was accessible to everyone and the food and drink were perfect. Thank you for making out wedding stress free and wonderful."
V189,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert was the most wonderful venue for our London wedding. We came across the venue at there wedding fair and chose alot of our suppliers from the same wedding fair.

Harrison and Lauren were always so on hand to help with any questions and did a fantastic job answering all of our questions. The staff were so friendly and helpful and made everything run like clockwork.

We couldn’t recommend The Prince Albert enough for a london wedding and would love to do it all again."
V189,The Prince Albert,"My wife and I were beyond happy with how everything went on our wedding day. Harrison, Diana, Claudio and the whole team were absolutely phenomenal! It was such a beautifully efficient operation, and we always felt like someone was there to help us when needed.

We've had dozens of compliments about the great food and how wonderfully intimate the venue was for a wedding. Some of our more traditional relatives said they were initially sceptical at the prospect of a pub wedding, but that it was one of the most beautiful and joyful weddings they’d been to. A friend of mine was also very happy that someone at the bar remembered her drink order throughout the evening! On top of that, everything ran perfectly to schedule, which is no doubt down to the high attention to detail.

It was very useful that the upstairs was free on Friday afternoon so that we could set up the space. It gave us plenty of time to do the flower arrangements, put up the bunting, and stick photos on the frame wall.

Thank you again so much for all the help and support you've given us - it really was the best day of our lives (so far)!"
V189,The Prince Albert,"My husband and I got married here in late September 2023, and I cannot recommend the Prince Albert enough!! Booking a wedding venue can be stressful and we felt like a lot of the venues we looked at gave us the ""hard sell"" but the folks at the Prince Albert helped to put us at ease every step of the way. We fell in love with how beautiful the pub was, so hired the upstairs for the ceremony, wedding breakfast and party afterwards for around 40 - 45 people. We were able to drop off decorations the night before and talk it all through with the staff, and they did such a good job of working with us and the florist to get the place looking amazing. The ceremony went off without a hitch, everybody loved the food and we had a blast in the evening. All the staff were amazing, but special shout out to Harrison and Lauren for helping us plan and run the day, and Maria for managing everything on the ground both when we dropped off the decorations and during the wedding itself. Thank you again for helping us celebrate our special day with our loved ones, for making it so stress free and so memorable!"
V189,The Prince Albert,"All you ever hear about wedding venues is that everything is a rip off, the food is meh, and there are a ton of annoying restrictions...the opposite is true of Harrison and The Prince Albert team. From Day 1, Harrison made the whole process not only easy but really fun! He was quick to respond, super knowledgeable, and very accommodating; he even helped our best man execute a surprise for us without it disrupting any timings. On the day, they decorated the place beautifully, managed to serve a 3 course dinner to 76 people unbelievably fast, and everyone raved about the food - to say they did a good job is a gross understatement, they went above and beyond. We were after ""classy fun"" and that's exactly what we got - thank you so so much!"
V189,The Prince Albert,"We had the exact wedding reception we wanted at the Prince Albert thanks to Harrison, Claudio and the other amazing staff who helped us feel so relaxed in the build up and during. We wanted a very low-key vibe and the team understood that but there were enough options for any style of wedding you wanted. The upstairs function room felt cozy and intimate while still leaving breathing room and space to dance, but you could easily rent the whole place if you wanted more guests and even choose to do your ceremony there. We had the most compliments on our food (we chose a buffet option). The team were particularly accomodating to some complicated dietary requirements and it was all delicious."
V189,The Prince Albert,"July 6, 2023 was the most memorable day of our lives! A big thank you to Harrison and the rest of the team for assisting us through out the whole process. Our guests loved the Prince Albert pub especially the sumptuous food and booze on our wedding day!

David & Dannah"
V189,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert is a Great venue for the classic Pub Wedding.
Harrison and the team did an amazing job to organize everything. The food was great and the service first class. Only sorry it was over so quickly. Thanks again for everything."
V189,The Prince Albert,"We found The Prince Albert when our original venue cancelled on us less than 2 months before our wedding. & we are so glad we did; everything happens for a reason! From the moment we met Harrison, we knew we were in safe hands, and the team at the Prince Albert made our day amazing. The pub looked beautiful and we were very greatful for the effort the team put in putting up all our decorations. We had so many compliments about the food, and we were very impressed in the swift and organised manner in whichever it was served. Everyone had a wonderful time, and we would not hesitate in recommending The Prince Albert."
V190,Kindred,"We chose Kindred for our 60 person wedding and it could not have been better. We wanted a venue where we could have the ceremony, dinner and dancing all under one roof, that was wheelchair accessible, and easy to get to on the tube, Kindred ticks all those boxes and more!
The food is incredible, we really enjoyed popping by to do all the tastings, we'll continue to come to the Cellar for food and cocktails. Many guests commented on how good the food was.
The place itself is gorgeous, inside and out. We used the whole venue, the main Hall for the ceremony, dinner and dancing, and the Library upstairs for the drinks reception and cake cutting. Also, being right next to Hammersmith station, the venue could not be easier to get to!
The staff are wonderfully attentive and helpful, both before and on the day. They were really open to the little details that made our day uniquely ours, from the drinks selections, to having a table and glasses on stage for the ceremony, to playing our music selections at the right time. Plus its a dog friendly venue!"
V190,Kindred,"We LOVE this venue! We got married here with only 12 weeks notice and Anna, the owner, and her staff went above and beyond to make the day as memorable, magical, and marvellous as we'd hoped it would be. The venue is elegant, stylish and perfect for a London, city based wedding. The food is sensational as it comes from their in-house kitchen on the ground floor and every guest remarked on how delicious their meal was. It's restaurant quality food, not your standard wedding food. The place looks stunning in all our wedding photos and the wedding cake they made us (at very short notice I might add!) was second to none. Everyone loved it. The venue was also perfect for late night dancing and drinking and merriment. It was such a pleasure - and a breeze - to work with Anna and her team on one of the most important days of my life, and I very much hope to do so again in the future. I will forever be grateful to her and all she helped us with."
V190,Kindred,"We had our wedding reception for 35 guests at Kindred, in the Library and Salon earlier this year. The day went incredibly smoothly, the staff couldn't have been more attentive and our guests raved about the food for weeks afterwards. It was the perfect sized space for our intimate celebration, really cosy and the atmosphere was great. The little touches really helped to make the day special, with espresso martinis served for the speeches and sparklers for our exit at the end of the night. Thanks again to the lovely Kindred team!"
V190,Kindred,"I cannot find a single fault in our experience with Kindred for our wedding. Not only was it a stunning venue that honestly made some of our guests gasp as they arrived, but Anna and the team were so incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. Having them support us really took so much of the wedding planning stress away and we knew we were in safe hands. I really appreciated that the team were happy to chat through ideas with me and were always keen to find creative solutions to give us the day that we had envisioned.

The food was absolutely delicious and they were so accommodating for our long list of dietary requirements from our guest. The cocktails were also so delicious. Our guests were buzzing for weeks after, as were we.

On the night, the staff were not only incredibly helpful and efficient, but also just so friendly, welcoming and complimentary. We felt thoroughly spoilt and very well looked after.

We visited so many venues and this was by far the best choice for us. The interiors made for some stunning photos and the layout of the spacing meant that whilst we had 80-100 guests, it still felt very intimate. I cannot recommend Kindred enough!"
V190,Kindred,"We would give a thousand stars if we could. Kindred hosted us for our cocktail style wedding and it was everything we could have hoped for and the perfect venue for this style of wedding. The wine, cocktails and food (incredible grazing board, canapés, bowls and pizzas) were exceptional and the team were on top of everything, friendly and nothing was ever an issue. We would HIGHLY recommend it. We have had loads of guests message us to tell us what a spectacular venue it was with the most friendly team. The venue had different spaces to suit our needs and the AV is amazing - it worked perfectly for our live music band and our DJ, and our own music playlists for our ceremony. They took the stress off planning and really did mean we could relax and not worry that everything would run smoothly. Thank you so much Kindred team for giving us the best day of our lives"
V191,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The best day of our lives and me and my now husband couldn't be more thankful to Bredenbury. Before booking Bredenbury we visited over 17 wedding venues in Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Herefordshire - we fell in love instantly, there is no need for a crazy amount of extra expense on decorations, the venue speaks for itself. The fact that it was no corkage just added to why we wanted to book and the team were so friendly. In the lead up to the wedding they were brilliant, we booked far in advance and brought over all our family members to come see the venue, they were so flexible, understanding and welcoming - they couldn't do enough for us. On the wedding day they had decorated for us by the time we had arrived and all we had to do on the day was to enjoy it - which was perfect. It really was the best day of our lives, all the comments from our family and friends was how beautiful the venue was. They kept the day running so smooth and we didn't need to think about a thing."
V191,Bredenbury Court Barns,"There truly aren't words to describe how incredible Bredenbury Court Barns and their entire team of fantastic staff were through the planning process and the day itself. They were so friendly, supportive and nothing was ever too much. From quick replies to any questions that popped to mind to planning meetings that left us feeling prepared and ready to the day being set up beyond perfectly. Our amazing wedding coordinator Lianna spent the days and months (years really!) leading up to our big day making sure everyone detail was perfect, that everything was incorporated that we'd dreamed of and made sure we didn't feel a moment of stress from start to finish. All throughout the building from the bridal booth, to the orangery to the oak barn was beautifully light and open - even with our wedding being the end of October - and we had so many compliments about this! There aren't enough words to say thank you and explain just how much we'd recommend this venue to everyone"
V191,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We had the perfect day back in July. The weather didn't go to plan but they helped make the day so special even with the last minute switches because of the rain. We had such an amazing day and the feedback from our guests about the venue, food and service was great! We cannot thank the team enough for the effort they put in throughout the whole process but especially on the day. We felt incredibly supported throughout the whole process."
V191,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The venue itself is stunning. The buildings, grounds and interior decorations are all beautiful and immaculately presented. From the moment you turn down the lane it is so picturesque, you know you've found somewhere special. It's exactly what we were imagining for our wedding venue.

The layout is perfect, with ample space for guests to mingle and move about, and great accessibility for older and disabled guests. Ours was a winter wedding, and while most of the day was inside it wasn't cramped and we could still enjoy the beautiful grounds through the expansive windows that run along the whole barn.

All of the venue is stunning, but practicality-wise the Bridal Suite warrants a special mention. Room length mirrors, plenty of room for the bridal party to get ready, have their makeup and hair done, and if there's time to relax as well. Drinks were served from 11 onwards, and it has it's own toilets and shower.

From our first meeting at Bredenbury the staff were exceptional. They gave a reassuring air of professionalism and experience, with just the right level of excitedness for our day without it feeling forced. We were really impressed by how responsive the whole team were, with speedy replies to any questions we had during the planning. This is something we particularly appreciated as we only gave ourselves 7 weeks to plan our big day.

Value for money wise it felt tricky to gauge when we were trying to choose a venue as the headline figure is rarely what you'll end up paying, with different venues charging different amounts for different things. Not the case with Bredenbury. With their No Corkage policy and generosity in being able to use whatever props they already have, any extras were non-essentials of our own choosing.

No Corkage is pretty significant. Some venues wanted to charge £20/bottle, so not having to pay this and being able to supply not only our own wine but beers, gin and soft drinks for the drinks reception and wedding breakfast was not only a massive saving but also made the occasion more personal for us. The bar staff and catering team were excellent, pouring and serving drinks, warming our mulled wine and setting up the gin bar. Once your guests have drunk you dry the venue's bar is well stocked and standard pub pricing.

We wanted a Christmas wedding and seeing in early November that they had a date available that December we couldn't resist. 7 weeks isn't long to organise a wedding with nearly 100 guests, and we couldn't have done it without the Bredenbury team being so organised. Our assigned event manager, Harriet, was brilliant in the runup and on the day, as were all the other managers and staff we spoke with. The Wedding Bible they fill out with you is a great idea and nails down all the finer details to ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible on the day.

We didn't want to have to spend the day before and morning of our wedding worrying about set up and decorations, but needn't have worried as Bredenbury did all of this for us. A meeting beforehand clarified what we wanted where; we simply dropped off boxes of stuff the day before and rocked up in the morning to find everything laid out as hoped.

This organisation extended to the third party suppliers, of which Bredenbury have an extensive list of local recommendations. We booked the ceiling lights with Cotswold Wedding Co. and didn't have to do anything else. The band, Apollo Gold (incredible!!) set up without any hassle and didn't have any issues with Bredenbury's noise limiter. Our florist Katrina Bevis hadn't been there before, but again had no problem getting everything in place on the morning.

On-site accommodation was good for close family and friends, but there's not enough for the majority of guests and the lack of a dedicated honeymoon suite is a bit of a shame. If you want privacy for your first night as a married couple it means taking over an entire lodge. The quality and comfort of the rooms is excellent, though, and the continental breakfast served the morning after in the East Lodge was delicious, with ample options for Vegan and Gluten Free.

Jenkinsons are the exclusive caterer for Bredenbury and have an extensive menu for nibbles, the wedding breakfast and dinner. The menu and ordering process is clear, and pricing is what we expected to pay. Food and service was as slick and faff-free as everything else. A real delight.

On the day, Harriet and the catering manager were absolute superstars. Zero stress, everything ran to time and as planned, and they were always available if we had any questions or needed help.

The whole day was perfect and exactly what we wanted. I don't think we could have achieved this without the exceptional organisation of Harriet and the team. The entire process was very slick, zero stress, and we wouldn't hesitate in recommending Bredenbury Court Barns to anyone looking to get married in a countryside paradise."
V191,Bredenbury Court Barns,"I want to say a massive thank you to Bredenbury Court Barns for hosting our wedding. From the start they were super amazing and accommodating to us. They won us over with their care and support even when we had a pickle in the beginning.

Olivia was super helpful from the start and throughout the year we were planning she offered huge amount of support and suggestions.

We typed in “orangery weddings” in google when we were first looking because I was keen to get a ceremony in an orangery and Bredenbury popped up after much searching. Once we saw the Orangery we cancelled every other viewing we had across the country because we felt we found the perfect place, and nothing compared to the reception with the beautiful windows that brought all the light in. The grounds were absolutely spectacular and gorgeous. It was a no brainer for us to pick such a beautiful venue. They brought my ideas to life and we were able to get support on anything from recommendation of suppliers, to ideas on decor to their favourite meals from Jenkinson’s. They fully outdid themselves in love for us. We can’t forget it.

Our wedding day was exceptional with Lianna helping us all the way. She was a breath of fresh air. She cared about all the little details and made us feel relaxed and had a good laugh with us. The fact she was there 100% of the way, before the wedding, during the wedding, and even after is unmatched! Thank you Lianna for really being there to make our wedding day smooth and relaxing.

The food was incredible too and we often think about how sad it is that we didn’t finish our second plates, we think about it a lot.

Thank you for the wonderful journey BCB, you blew us away with your integrity, kindness, and genuine support!"
V191,Bredenbury Court Barns,thank you to everyone at bredenbury court barns who made our day so special
V191,Bredenbury Court Barns,"From the moment we stepped foot into Bredenbury Court Barns, we knew this was the venue for us. It was the first and only venue we viewed as we were blown away by how gorgeous the venue is. The venue itself is absolutely stunning, with breathtaking views and impeccably maintained grounds that set the perfect backdrop for our special day.

The staff went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. From our first consultation to the last dance, their professionalism and attention to detail were exceptional. Harriet was absolutely brilliant and I don’t know what we would have done without her!

The food was another highlight—our guests are still talking about how delicious everything was! Jenkinsons are amazing, they helped us personalise our menu perfectly!

We couldn’t have asked for a more beautiful venue to have our wedding. The day couldn’t have been more perfect! Thank you to everyone at Bredenbury Court Barns for making our wedding day nothing short of magical!"
V191,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We could not have had a more perfect experience with Bredenbury Court Barns. Right from initial booking all the way through to breakfast the following morning, everything was perfect. Nothing was too much trouble for our wonderful planner, Lianna. She ensured the day ran smoothly and our months of planning turned out exactly as we’d imagined. They are available to answer any questions you have any time, they’re only an email away and get back to you so fast. The venue itself if just gorgeous, the grounds make for some wonderful photos, and the orangery lets so much light in that your ceremony photos are gorgeous. The whole place is fully air conditioned too which was great for our July wedding. The bridal suite is a perfect balance of being aesthetically pleasing and practical for getting ready in, it’s so spacious, lots of natural light, there’s plenty of plug sockets and huge mirrors so everyone has plenty of room for getting ready and no one is on top of eachother. There’s even an outside space for getting some fresh air. I’m so glad we chose to have our wedding here, it’s given us memories to cherish forever and there are zero memories of any stress!! Cannot recommend this venue enough!"
V191,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We cannot believe how lucky we fell to get married at such a beautiful venue. Right from the offset of viewing the venue, to our special day, we were taken of. No question was too silly, and so much pressure was taken off us during the planning. We managed to make everything our own and Lianna was there every step of the way. Thank you for giving us our happily ever after. We will forever be grateful."
V191,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We loved our wedding at Bredenbury the team did an amazing job providing everything we asked for and more. We especially liked that our wedding coordinator for the day, Harriet had thought of everything for us she went above and beyond and even offered to go and get my mum some more shoes when hers broke! absolute 5-star service and the food was amazing too!"

V193,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow what can I say, Brinsop is an absolutely stunning wedding venue with heaps of character and so many options of places for the ceremony and to do things. We fell in love with it as soon as we saw it and knew it was where we wanted to get married.

Right from the start, the Brinsop team were so helpful and accommodating. From giving an virtual tour then showing us around in person, Issy and the team were fantastic right the way through. Nothing was a hassle, no request too difficult and they were incredibly professional and responsive throughout the whole process.

We loved that Brinsop is an exclusive venue with accommodation on site so we could stay with the bridal party and our immediate family. All the rooms are unique and have so much character and it's fun exploring the whole place. You feel like you are in the middle of nowhere, in nature with swans, ducks and birds all around.

Throughout our planning process, Issy and the team helped us every step of the way, being incredibly flexible in managing our requests and really trying to create our vision. They even got their team to make a giant jenga that we could use on the day! They helped to create the most perfect bespoke wedding breakfast and canapes menu, and seemed so positive and excited to be part of our special day and experience.

Arriving at the venue, Issy and the team were ready and had everything prepared and ready to go. It made the process so smooth for us and meant we could really enjoy the day without any stress. Issy coordinated perfectly with all of our vendors and it really felt like she and the whole team were so happy for us and wanted to be part of our day which was amazing. Our guests commented on how friendly and responsive all the staff were and it really made the experience extra special.

I wouldn't change anything about the day and it was perfect. I would absolutely recommend Brinsop as a wedding venue and all the staff who are really invested in helping deliver your vision. Thank you so so much to the whole team for making this a day that we will look back on for many years to come with amazing memories."
V193,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow, what a perfect day we had! It really went without a hitch and that was thanks to Nina and all the staff at Brinsop. The team worked seamlessly to ensure the day was as perfect as could be, and it really was! The wedding was booked over 2 years in advance and the staff were so accommodating with all my questions, planning and site visits, they couldn’t do more to support us. Special thanks to our coordinator Nina who was a delight to work with and a credit to Brinsop. Everyone that attended agreed at how beautiful the venue and grounds were, it was a wedding people won’t forget! 10/10 would recommend to anyone!"
V193,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"It's taken me quite a while to get round to writing this review, because sadly it's quite a bittersweet one.

We were married last year on 15 June and Brinsop was our chosen venue for both our ceremony and reception. We were first attracted to brinsop by the accomodation, meaning our loved ones could stay on-site, especially my grandparents which was so important to me.

The home itself is absolutely beautiful, including ivy cottage which myself and my mum stayed in the night before the big day. It really was a picture perfect setting, and looking down from the bridal suite seeing the ceremony space being set up on the Wordsworth lawn was honestly magical. Id dreamed of an outdoor wedding on that lawn, and we were so grateful the weather cleared so we could have it. The team really did wait till the latest they could to ask us to make a call on an inside or outside wedding (despite being June, it was a gloomy day to start) which I really appreciated!

Another amazing part of hiring brinsop was the after hours space we were able to enjoy until 2am with our house guests. The games room was absolute fantastic and meant that if you wanted to go to bed you could, but you could also stay up, party and play pool. I really do think this was a highlight for our guests and would recommend massively if you can spare some budget.

On the night of the wedding, myself and my new husband actually stayed in one glamping tents which we absolutely loved. The groundsman was on site until we were ready to leave the games room, and he then took us up to our tent in one of the buggies, making sure we had plenty of blankets and even stopping off for some bottles of water for us. This was really special, and can't thank him enough.

Hugo Spritz!! Having hugos at both our welcome drinks and drinks reception after the ceremony was amazing. I'm not a fan of prosecco myself and Mark and the team made it possible for us to have Hugo's all round. We even sneaked some up to the bridal suite to have before the ceremony (thanks Nadia!). Our guests loved them, and the amount of people that have told me they now need them at their own wedding is crazy!

Onto the not so good - sadly it all started to go a little downhill when we moved things into the knot barn for our wedding breakfast. Sitting on the top table, I could see that guests at the top of the second rows of long tables didn't really even have a seat around the table and were just kind of plonked on. The seating plan hadn't been followed, and I don't think there were even enough tables laid for the service to be comfortable for people because there was a dance floor at the end of the barn (which I did not ask for).

It was quickly also brought to my attention, that one of our guests had had to put her child on her lap in order to remove the high chair so people had more space. We also lost about 5 napkins with them setting on fire from the candles because everything was just way too cramped.

I asked to speak to catering, and asked if there was anything that they could do. I was told 'well sure, if you want the whole thing to be late'. In truth I shouldn't have even had to broach this myself, as it should have been sorted by the coordination team.

The tables weren't changed, even after they'd said they'd sort after the first course and yet the whole meal still ran late. We've had so much feedback about people not having enough food, food not being easy to access on the sharing platters etc and honestly when you've waited so long for a day and had spent 25k on the venue and food alone, it really has been heartbreaking to hear. I do sometimes question why people still bring it up (even now, people talk about the dining) when it clearly upset me so much.

Whilst writing this review my husband asked my what we had for evening food - we didn't get any. It was left unannounced on a back table. I don't know what I was expecting, just not that.

The next morning, the houseguests were asked to come down to breakfast for 9am (it was on a note in the room) but as we were in the glamping area, we walked past the knot barn just before 8.30 and the food was already out. We ran down to the house to hurry everyone up, and by which time everyone arrived it had been sitting there for 20plus mins going cold.

My biggest upset was that when I fed all of the above back to brinsop, feeling pretty deflated about the catering, I was told they'd pass my feedback on and heard absolutely nothing back. 25k total with over 10k on food and drinks to hear absolutely nothing, and this was 9 months ago. I'm not saying this in would happen to anyone else, but really - it shouldn't have happened to us either."
V193,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our wedding! From start to finish, everything at Brinsop was flawless. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most magical backdrop for our special day. Our guests were blown away by the beautiful venue, the warm atmosphere, and the seamless coordination. Every detail was taken care of, and we felt so well looked after. The team was incredible, professional, friendly, and attentive. On the day itself, they ensured everything ran smoothly, allowing us to truly enjoy every moment. A special mention goes to our amazing wedding coordinator Nina!"
V193,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We had our wedding on New Year's Eve 2024 at Brinsop, and it was more perfect that we could have ever hoped for. The venue itself is stunning, with beautiful spacious rooms which slept over 40 of our guests. Our coordinator, Nina, was incredible and so supportive on the day - she kept everything running so smoothly and everything went by without a glitch. The food and drink managers Mark and Amy did the most incredible job - nothing was ever too much, they were so attentive, and the chefs the most stunning meal after we gave them a fairly vague brief of 'curry'! We had the most perfect day and we're so incredibly grateful to Brinsop and the team."
V193,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,Brinsop Court is pure magic—an unforgettable venue with an incredible team!
V193,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We were lucky enough to have our wedding at Brinsop Court in December, and it was an absolutely spectacular day. We fell in love with Brinsop as soon we set our eyes on the beautiful manor and surrounding gardens. Cate, Amy, Mark and the rest of the wonderful staff at Brinsop really go the extra mile to make you feel special, and are extremely flexible with requests in order to make your day feel more special. We honestly felt like there was no request too big leading up to the day and they really made us feel extremely comfortable leading up to the day.
On the day, Cate and her team were well on hand to help us with setting up everything and she had everything under control when there were a few hiccups. The day itself was absolutely magical, and that wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for everyone at Brinsop working extremely hard to ensure that everything went to plan and as smoothly as it could.
Thank you to everyone at Brinsop for making us feel at ease and ensuring that our wedding was an amazing day."
V193,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Brinsop, the perfect wedding venue! We got married at Brinsop in December and I can honestly say it was everything we could have hoped for and more. We found out about the venue through Hitched and was one of only two venues that we visited but as soon as we got the house we knew it was the one. We fell in love with everything about it and it was fair to say that our guests agreed with us with many saying it was the nicest venue they’d been to. We had the wonderful Nina as our coordinator and she was brilliant! Nothing was too much trouble and we had constant communication with her in the build up which helped our stress levels no end. The same can be said for all of the staff who were brilliant throughout and allowed us to have the best day of our lives with everything running seamlessly. A special mention must be given to Amy and the catering staff who put on such an incredible menu (including the tasting session that provided some of the best food we’d ever had) and ensured that the food has been one of the main things that people have mentioned to us since the wedding! We had our ceremony in the Banqueting Hall which provided the perfect setting, especially with it being a winter wedding, as it really added to the cosy atmosphere and the lounge areas/games room were perfect for the drink’s reception. We would have loved to have also had it in the courtyard, but the temperatures meant that the lounge with the fireplace was a far more appealing option on the day. We then had the wedding breakfast and reception in the knot barn which was decorated beautifully and was the perfect place for the party in the evening. Overall we really can’t thank everyone at Brinsop enough for making our day what it was, we can honestly say that we have been made to feel part of the family and already can’t wait to hopefully come back to stay in one of the cottages for our first anniversary!"
V193,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Where do I start!!
Brinop Court is the most stunning venue, it was the first venue we visited and instantly fell in love! Theres so much history to the house and we were treated like family every time we visited before the wedding and it literally felt like home the whole weekend of the wedding, my guests also agreed!!

A special thank you to Issy our coodinator who went above and beyond ti make sure everything was perfect for us. It was so easy to plan and nothing was too much to ask, even arranging our dog to be our ring bearer!! When they say Brinsop is dog friendly they really mean it!!!

What a place, what a day!! Thank you so much everyone, you all made our day perfect and it really was the best day of our lives♥️"
V193,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We got married at the gorgeous Brinsop in October this year. It’s hard to put into words how amazing the whole experience was. We honestly had the best day of our lives!!!

We fell in love with Brinsop during our first visit back in December 2022. We knew almost immediately that Brinsop was the venue we were looking for! From the outside the venue looked like a painting - from the picturesque views of the countryside, to the swans swimming on the moat! The manor house itself has so much character, and has a lovely homely feel to it as you walk around it. Our guests were equally blown away by the venue!

A big thing for us was that it’s dog friendly, which meant we could have our two dogs join us on our special day, it wouldn’t have been the same without them there! They had so much fun walking around the grounds and greeting all of our guests!

Nina, our coordinator, and her team were always available to answer any of our questions in the run up to the day. This really put us at ease, knowing we were in safe hands. On the day, Nina and the team made sure everything ran smoothly and went above and beyond to ensure our guests were looked after. A shout out to Amy who heads up catering and Mark who manages the bar. The food and drinks were absolutely fantastic!

I highly recommend this venue! There’s a reason Brinsop is an award winning venue - and when you visit it’s not hard to see why. We are already looking forward to going back there for a date night next year! Thanks for everything Team Brinsop!

V194,The Manor at Bickley,"The Manor is the perfect venue for weddings! When our wedding venue fell through 4 months before the big day, I stumbled onto the Manor at Bickley and spoke to Craig. He was most helpful and kind and went above and beyond to make sure our wedding went ahead.

We hired the venue for our two day wedding and the staff were helpful and accommodating from start to finish. All of our guests were awed by the beautiful well kept grounds and the excellent service. We can’t thank the staff enough for making our wedding dreams a reality. They thought of every detail from bringing us champagne after our civil ceremony to making sure we had our card box at the end of the night! We are excited to head back to celebrate our anniversary there!"
V194,The Manor at Bickley,"Myself and my Husband chose this venue for our wedding last week and we can’t sing The Manor’s praises enough. From our very first enquiry, to the first viewing of the venue, right though until the big day, the staff at the manor have been nothing short of brilliant! Each staff member we came across was polite and accommodating. Special mention to Craig and Vicky with whom we did most of our liaising throughout the months leading up until our wedding. Craig and Vicky were super helpful, responsive and went above and beyond to make sure that we could have the day of our dreams. Even with last minute changes due to the weather, Craig who was just incredible throughout, managed to help us sort a backup plan so our day would still go ahead seamlessly.

The rooms at the manor were spacious and modern, giving us and our wedding party lots of space for photographers and videographers to capture the special moments on our wedding morning.

The lodge that was used for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready was fabulous. The manor was very flexible in giving us early access so we could get ready on time.

The grand marquee was definitely grand! Very spacious and when decorated looked like something out of a fairytale! lots of kitchen space, a huge bar and fantastic overhead speakers for the party!

The manor was super flexible to our needs regarding access, start times, outsourcing our vendors and much more. The venue is beautiful and spacious with options for outdoor and indoor events and entertainment. The grounds were absolutely beautiful, so many lovely spots for photos not only for us as the bride and groom but for guests too!

A very special thank you to our point of contact throughout, Craig. From our first meeting, he was charming, bubbly and made us feel super welcome. He reassured us that he has experience in African/Caribbean weddings and that our wedding day would amazing and it was. He was attentive and always let us know that he was only a phone call or e-mail away and was always quick to respond and answer any questions we had.

All in all, we had the most beautiful day at The manor and we would definitely recommend this venue for a wedding or other events.

V194,The Manor at Bickley,"We hired The Manor at Bickley for my daughters wedding. Got a brilliant service from the venue. Everything was set accordingly, as per floor plan. Our guests were loved the venue grounds/facilities and the overall wedding set up.
Thank you to everyone at Bickley."
V194,The Manor at Bickley,"A warm and friendly service from the very helpful staff, a feeling that it is your own house! The food was amazing and the atmosphere made us and our guests feel fantastic."
V195,Davenport House,We are so pleased we chose Davenport House for our wedding reception. Charley and the team were so helpful and thoughtful. Putting canapés behind the bar for us and making sure everything ran so smoothly. I am obsessed with the stunning house and grounds and it was absolutely perfect! Thank you so much for making our day so special!!
V195,Davenport House,"Davenport House is a STUNNING wedding venue so how could we not have it for our big day!?

The staff were exceptional! From the moment we booked through to our big day, we had an absolute blast and could not thank each member of staff enough! Special shout out to Jared (hopefully spelt right, haha!) who made sure we were fed, watered and ensured we took 5 minutes to ourselves every moment we could - Also even saved us slices of pie wedding cake before we went to bed!

Our guests have said they have never been to a wedding so spectacular, with the most amazing food and amazing staff so could not have been happier having Davenport as our venue! 🩷"
V195,Davenport House,"I just wanted to write to say a huge, enormous thank you to Charley and all the team at Davenport House. We still can’t believe how perfect our day was, and lots of our guests have told us it’s the best wedding they’ve ever been to. The team were all a huge part of making that happen. It was incredibly seamless and well planned on the day, meaning we genuinely didn’t have to think about a thing, except for enjoying ourselves. The day ran to schedule perfectly and even certain touches we didn’t know or expect to happen were planned by you and the team, which made the day even more special. Thank you so much for giving us our dream wedding day. We can’t wait to see the full set of pictures and the video now to relive it all!"
V195,Davenport House,"Without doubt the best day of our lives. From start to finish, Davenport has exceeded expectations. From the very first impression of the venue during the open day, the incredible food tasting evening, all the way through to the day itself, including the support and preparation leading up to it. It was really important to us to pick a venue that not only ticked the fairytale box, but also come with the complete support of a wedding planner, due to our busy jobs. We were lucky enough to have Charley as ours. She really took the time to listen and get to know us, to ensure the day was tailored to exactly what we wanted. We even had our own cocktail designed, which went down an absolute storm on the day! She considered every little detail, constantly putting our minds at ease, which made the whole process so easy and enjoyable. Honestly the day couldn’t have gone smoother, any anxiety or stress faded immediately as soon as we got to the venue. It was simply perfect. So many of our guests were complimentary of just how beautiful the venue is and just how well organised the day was, and that is the perfect way to summarise Davenport. Any prospective couples thinking of selecting Davenport as their venue, hesitate no further. It will be a day you never knew was possible! We cannot thank you enough Charley and the Davenport team, if only we could live the day over and over again"
V195,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was amazing. When looking for a venue we weren't just looking for something wow, we needed to have people who were enthused and passionate about their work - we found that at Davenport House.

From our first phone call & meeting with Lizzie and Tallulah, we knew this was the place for us. Having two brides wasn’t an issue; combining British, Asian and Spanish cultures - wasn't an issue; having brides enter together – wasn’t an issue. Nothing was an issue. At Davenport House, we got it all – a picturesque venue and the best team of staff anyone could ever wish for. All our external suppliers have commented what a fantastic venue you are. All out guests have said that the service and attention to detail was second to none. The thoughtful touches like hiring a Spanish speaking waiter for the table which spoke very little English ensured that everyone felt welcomed. Guests with dietary requirements didn't feel they got a second rate meal or they were an afterthought - the food for all throughout the day was exceptional. The rooms / cottages where our guests and we stayed, spotless and comfortable. The thought behind adding some cheese and Spanish ham to the morning breakfast - so sweet!

Special shout out to Megan - wedding planner extraordinaire who kept in touch throughout the planning process and was exceptional on the day. Ian who worked tirelessly to ensure the day ran smoothly and the food was perfect, Charley who was also in charge of one bride and ensuring that everything was on point. All the staff were fantastic - polite, professional and personal.

Everyone keeps saying that this was the best wedding they have ever attended and that’s a lot of weddings between people! When we asked why, they say things like ‘the venue’, ‘the staff’, but it all came back to the inclusivity, love & joy that they felt – and you were all a part of that.

Davenport House is a stunning venue made even better by those who work there. If you want the whole package on your wedding day, we strongly recommend you book them.

Thank you to the entire Davenport House team.

Sat and Ana xx"
V195,Davenport House,"Where to begin with our beautiful venue and thanking the people who made it all happen! We got married in November at Davenport House and it was easily the best day of our lives. We chose Davenport because we wanted to host our cosy winter wedding in a big grand house in the country, with all the grandeur and class but to still feel like an intimate celebration with our family and closest friends, and it was perfect in delivering just that. It is utterly beautiful, the location was perfect and exactly what we wanted. The food was absolutely AMAZING, we had so many compliments from our guests and we are so grateful for the team in delivering such a fabulous wedding breakfast. Thank you so much to Lizzie who couldn’t do more to help us have our dream day, and Ian who delivered the best service to us and our guests (the pizza at 2am was very much appreciated)

Massive massive thank you to Charley our wedding planner, who was so so helpful throughout our wedding planning process and on the day, I can’t thank her enough. She was always there whenever I needed her, helped me so much with creating our dream day and I will be forever grateful to her for keeping me sane! Whenever I had any worries I knew she was just a phone call away, which helped me a lot when planning a wedding!

Charley, Lizzie and Ian thank you for everything - best team ever. Our day was seamless and it was all down to you and your incredible team.

Jess and Sam xx"
V195,Davenport House,"Me and my (now) wife chose Davenport House as our wedding venue in mid 2022, to get married in September 2023, and it was the best decision we could have made. We looked at a range of Georgian style manor house type venues located in Cheshire, North Wales and the West Midlands areas. It blew all of the competition away in terms of the venue aesthetics, the balance in design (i.e. period characteristics vs modern design), the impressive condition of the property for its age plus what it offered for our wedding weekend.

Staff and service - In the UK, this is usually something that is average at best - if you're lucky. At Davenport House, the service from all staff was 10/10. I honestly don't think we've ever had better service for anything. We had a wedding planner from the start (Megan), who was an absolute saint and was fundamental in making the whole wedding a success. She was also instrumental in helping us find a way for our 'little' dog Bernie to be a part of the main event. Thanks Megan!

Accommodation - The fantastic condition, design and decor for Davenport House extends to all areas of the estate. The rooms are fantastic, very big, well maintained and cleaned religiously by the venue. We had no issues or problems from all of the guests who stayed onsite over the 3 days.

Food and drink - This got a lot of deserved praise from the guests too. We got to tailor our entire menu and it worked perfectly for what we wanted for the 3 days. The oyster bar and luxurious charcuterie board went down particularly well the day before the wedding.

I could keep writing much, much more on how fantastic this venue was for our wedding. But the best advice I could give for any interested couples is to go and visit it in person and reach out to Davenport House with any questions. Our own wedding ended up becoming both perfect and the best wedding we've ever been to. Thanks guys again!"
V195,Davenport House,"Fantastic location.
Great staff.
Beautiful place to get married.
I can wait to film here again soon thanks for having me."
V195,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was a fairytale, everything we could have dreamed of and more. Lizzie and Charley were fantastic in their support, organisation and professionalism in planning our wedding. The venue is simply spectacular- breathtaking. Our guests were blown away. The day ran so smoothly it was simply perfect. The food was out of this world our guests couldn't get enough. All the staff at the house went above and beyond to ensure we were happy and having a great day. The team were also extremely supportive of last minute changes/additions. The Davenport experience was truly wonderful and I'm sad to see it end right from our initial meetings, food tasting and finally our special day. Thank you: Lizzie, Charley, Ian and all of the team for a truly memorable day for us and our guests. Mr and Mrs Kissane"
V195,Davenport House,"We got married at Davenport House in February and they provided us with the most perfect day. Lizzie, Charley, Ian and the rest of the team were the best hosts we could have hoped for. Nothing was too much to ask and the guests all commented on the hospitality shown to them. The setting is utterly gorgeous, our weather was less than favourable so we did not make the most of the grounds but this didn't matter, the house was setting enough and so atmospheric! The food was utterly AMAZING and better than most restaurant food I have eaten. The venue feels intimate and grand at the same time.
I literally cannot recommend this place enough, they gave us the wedding we had always wanted and more!"

V197,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge on 12 May 2023 and it was incredible. The views are gorgeous and the photo opportunities are endless with beautiful floral and green surroundings. The team were super responsive throughout the process which is really reassuring and helpful when planning a wedding, and Nelson who ran the day was just fantastic. Every single detail was thought of and they run a really slick operation. This is essential as it meant I had a lot less to think about! They put me and my partner at ease throughout. The food and service on the day was fantastic, so many of our guests said this was the best food they’ve ever had at a wedding. Highly recommend! (Photos by Costa Weddings UK)"
V197,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","Pembroke where super helpful and provided a lot of guidance in helpful forms and layouts. Always available for a call and very helpful. on the day, it ran super smooth and and staff where lovely. Thank yo for making it a great day!"
V197,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge in October 2024. The whole day was magical, including the beautiful view over the autumn trees in Richmond Park. Robert made sure everything ran perfectly and helped us to find slots in the busy wedding timetable to fit in some special moments to also reflect traditions from my husband's Dutch culture. The food was great and the staff were polite and fun. All preparation with Lucy was also smooth and done with a smile. The Pembroke Lodge team ooze experience but make every wedding feel special and really listen to your wishes for the day. Highly recommend! Thank you to the whole Pembroke Lodge team, especially Robert, Lucy, the kitchen team and the staff on the day!"
V197,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park",The staff has been very helpful. They have a lot of experience. Open to any suggestions and help in critical situations.
V197,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue than Pembroke Lodge for our summer wedding. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most gorgeous backdrop for our special day. A huge thank you to our banqueting manager, Nelson, who went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly.

The team was incredibly supportive and accommodating throughout the planning process, making it an enjoyable and stress-free experience. Their professionalism and attention to detail made all the difference, and we’re so grateful for everything they did to make our day unforgettable. Highly recommend!"
V197,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We got married on the 3rd of October this year, and the team made our day magical! What a smooth day. We loved every second of it! The guests loved everything, and raved about the food and organisation.
Hiring Pembroke Lodge was easy. We had a viewing where all information was shared in detail and super clear to understand and make a decision.
On the months leading up to the big day our contact was Alice. Alice is a star. Responsive, professional, and had answers and solutions to everything.
On the day, Nelson coordinated the whole thing, minute by minute, and we are forever grateful for his politeness, professionalism and high spirits. We felt safe and in good hands. I would give Pembroke Lodge way over 5 stars if I could :)"
V197,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","My wedding went without a hitch, thanks to the amazing team at Pembroke Lodge (special thanks to Nicola & Robert)! They made sure everything was set up perfectly on the day, exactly in the way we had requested, and then ensured the day itself went as smoothly as we could've hoped. Everything looked beautiful and the stunning views made all of our guests fall in love with the venue too."
V197,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We had the most perfect day. The team have all been so responsive and accommodating of our every request. The venue is beautiful and we were lucky to have gorgeous sunset views. It is truly a countryside wedding but conveniently close to London, which was important for our overseas guests. The food was fantastic and staff were professional and efficient. Would recommend to anyone."
V197,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We recently had our wedding at Pembroke Lodge, and I cannot say enough good things about the venue, the team and manager, Robert. From the moment we started planning to the big day itself, he was absolutely incredible.

Robert went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. He was always available to answer our questions, offer solutions, and provide creative suggestions that enhanced our vision. He coordinated effortlessly with our vendors, making sure everyone was on the same page, which took so much stress off our shoulders.

On the day of the wedding, he was a true rockstar! He made sure the timeline flowed perfectly, from setting up the ceremony space to ensuring the reception transitions were seamless. His dedication and hands-on approach allowed us to enjoy every moment without worrying about a single thing.

Our wedding was a dream come true, and we owe so much of that to him and the team! Thank you, for everything you all did to make our day magical."
V197,"Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park","We could not have wished for a better wedding venue for our special day! Everyone went above and beyond to make sure our day goes perfectly without us having to worry about a single thing! A big shoutout to Nelson who was absolutely brilliant and made the day feel so calm and well thought through.

The food was delicious and all the team was so welcoming and super helpful on the day.

Thank you so much, we really really appreciate all the help!"
V198,The Hackney,"If you are having a wedding for under 60 people then this is your place! From start to finish the communication and planning of the wedding was seamless and took so much of the stress out of the day. The totally customisable packages that they offer really does suit anyone’s budget and more importantly regardless of what package you end up going for it is value for money. The food was delicious and it catered to everyone’s tastes including a pregnant guest, halal, vegan and lactose intolerant and was the talking point for our guests. The venue itself is stunning! Lots of exposed brick, they had recently redecorated before our wedding and the reception room that doubled up as the dance floor was styled simply but made a statement and the outdoor covered patio area was a welcome addition. The team understood our vision from the get go and they completely nailed it, all of our guests couldn’t believe it was here! I honestly can’t recommend it enough if you’re wanting a small and intimate wedding venue but still with all the class. I would say to future couples even if you think this wouldn’t be your venue please please do have a proper look because it will change your mind, I had come across this venue multiple times over the course of a year and decided to take a leap of faith and give it a chance and we’re so happy we did."
V198,The Hackney,"We can’t recommend the Hackney highly enough. They made the whole process so easy and they offer so much in-house which we took advantage of. The food was especially great - our guests were amazed “best food I’ve ever had at a wedding” and the team took great care of us during the planning stages.

They offer a very customisable service with scalable pricing. If you’re having a fairly small wedding (under 60) then you must check out The Hackney.

We had such a perfect day and we owe so much of that to the fabulous venue. Beautiful space, so professionally run."
V198,The Hackney,"We had such a brilliant experience working with the team at The Hackney. We were regularly in touch throughout the planning process and the use of the shared spreadsheet was especially handy for keeping everyone informed.
We had to postpone our wedding two days before as we were both sick with COVID, and the team were just fantastic. They waited for us to recover and then we started to talk through options again. We were able to rebook just six months after our original date, and the team were accomodating and understanding throughout the process.
The day itself was perfect. Lots of our guests commented on the quality and quantity of the food and Hugo was great at keeping everything to time. We wish we could do it all again."
V198,The Hackney,"We had our wedding reception here and wow was it amazing. Hugo, Erika and the whole team were amazing. Every single guest commented on how delicious and plentiful the food was. The staff were amazing nothing was too much to ask and all so happy.
The venue itself was decorated amazingly, given we left our wedding stationary etc up to the venue it exceeded our expectations. I was concerned about the allowed decibel level for Dj / entertainment but it was plenty loud enough. I wish I could relive the day again, if you’re thinking about booking The Hackney do it! You will not regret!"
V198,The Hackney,"We held our wedding reception at The Hackney in July and it was truly the best experience. We opted for a standing reception for our 65 guests, serving food bowl-style for a more relaxed, less formal feel. The food was absolutely delicious and there was lots of it - it just kept coming! Our guests are still raving about how good the food was months later! Lots of good drinks options too - we especially like the cocktails here!

The staff on the night were so friendly, welcoming and were amazing with our children guests too!

The Hackney is such an aesthetic venue with exposed brick walls and existing foliage which we loved, so we kept additional decorations to a minimum. We dropped our decorations to The Hackney the day before and picked them up the day after, which was super easy! We hadn’t given them too much direction with where we wanted everything placed but when we turned up to the venue on the day it was truly perfect! The staff know exactly what they’re doing and had decorated it beautifully! The outdoor seating area is a great feature too (especially for our two greyhounds who chilled out there for the majority of the reception!)

We opted for a simple Spotify playlist for our music and their sound system was good.

The wedding planning process was super easy from start to finish, with continued support and check-ins from Hugo, from the moment we booked, to the day itself! We really enjoyed the menu tasting experience earlier in the year too, which is a great touch in the build up to the big day! The planning spreadsheet was easy to use and made us feel content and relaxed, knowing that everything was under control.

Overall, we would highly recommend The Hackney to anyone looking for an affordable, dog-friendly, wedding reception venue with a laidback vibe, delicious food and lovely friendly staff! We look forward to coming back every year to celebrate our anniversary, with an espresso martini!"
V198,The Hackney,"We hosted our wedding reception with the team at the hackney in May 2023. The planning experience was straight forward and easy to book. The availability for the venue is on the website so easy to see when they have and get it booked. We went with the 5 canapés, bowl food menu, and drinks on arrival with wine through the event. The staff were brilliant and food delicious.

We loved the vibe of the venue as we wanted a bit more of a casual event, with a relaxed feel and we were able to host our 85 guests with no issues (although limited to standing event at this size, there is enough scattered seating for anyone to sit when they wanted).

In terms of decorating, we didn't feel the need to add any extra flowers as the venue was already so made up with plants and other decorations.

We did add the photo box which I highly recommend, was great fun for our friends and family and came with a memory book. People were shy at first but really got into it. We also used the recommended baker who provided a delicious cake.

Final area to mention - pricing. Wedding venues can be really expensive and daunting before you even start paying for any food or drink. Something that really attracted us to this venue was the low spacing cost and the minimum spend with it. It meant that we were able to completely customise the experience and see where the money we were spending was going. There are many different options and packages to go with, so it's up to you.

Only thing that wasn't offered was any tasting of the food beforehand which we would've liked to have done but none the less, the food was delicious so it wasn't really needed!

To finish, we loved every moment of it and hope that many others get to experience the same. Thank you very much team at the hackney!"
V198,The Hackney,"We had our reception in July. The venue was cosy and comfortably fit 30 people without feeling too crowded or too empty (we were worried it might be too empty). We managed to fit a band in, arranged mini-golf in the venue after dinner, and customize the cocktail menu with custom recipe (that we provided before hand).

One of the biggest highlights was the food. The crispy roast pork got so many complements and indeed it was tasty. But really, all the dishes were amazing (we had a tasting session prior), it was hard to choose, but the taste of each dish was still top notch on the day itself too. I heard that the supper snacks we ordered were great too but alas, I was too busy and they were snapped up instantly!

Some other details:
* We were allowed to use the small room downstairs as a private space to put our stuff. Very handy to not mess up items.
* We went with a bar tab and kept increasing the budget each time till the end of the night instead of the all-you-can-drink. From our rough calculations, it worked out about the same going for all-you-can-drink. Of course, certain folk were heavy weights and more than made it up will be different for each crowd.
* Lighting for photos came out excellent (combination of photographer and venue lighting).
* You can adjust air conditioning to suit the weather (we had ours on the warm side due to older folk not dealing with cold too well).
* Outdoor space was a pleasant change in atmosphere for those who wanted some fresh air.

What about the review from the Bride? Bride approved this review."
V198,The Hackney,"The day was fabulous - Hugo was brilliant and flexible with what we were after. The tasting day before was such a great idea and the whole experience and guidance given made planning a wedding in c.5 months so much easier. We had vegans, last minute drop outs, ridiculously hot weather, about 3 different spotify playlists, a string quartet, florists arriving in the morning and a cake that arrived the day before - the team took it all in their stride and it seemed like a breeze. Loved it all and we've had such good feedback from guests. A fabulous whirlwind.

Two very minor points for feedback - we maxed out the guest numbers (the team did advise us against it but were very accommodating despite us also throwing musicians into the mix) and it was a little too crowded pre-lunch on such a hot day. We also put some speeches in between courses (again, we were recommended against it) and that may have been a slight mistake for the dessert timings, as the tasting day was 10/10. But, it was a perfect day in a stunning venue. Loved it - thank you guys."
V198,The Hackney,"Jon and the team were absolute superstars, hosting the perfect wedding day for us. The space is beautiful, the decor is modern and perfect. They were so accommodating for any request or question we had which we really appreciated. Guests commented on how great the cocktails were! The day ran so smoothly and we had a fantastic time."
V198,The Hackney,"From the initial phonecall to the warm welcome we got when we first visited The Hackney, we knew we were in safe hands and that we’d made the perfect choice. The venue offers the most beautiful interiors - the perfect mix of cosy, intimate and modern industrial - exactly what we were looking for!

Our entire experience with The Hackney was an absolute dream -we loved the mega organised approach to planning. Something that could have been incredibly intimidating was made so straightforward with the amazing support of Hugo the General Manager who embraced all our weird and wonderful suggestions and gave expert advice on what we could do to make things even better. We left every meeting buzzing with ideas and even more excited to welcome our closest friends and family to the big day.

The quality of the food and drinks is impeccable - every single one of our guests (even the fussiest!) has commented on how much they loved it. We absolutely loved the menu tasting, even though it made the decision even harder as everything was amazing. What makes it even better for us is living close by and being able to pop into our wedding venue for a coffee or a cocktail!

I couldn't recommend The Hackney enough - I just wish we could go back and do it all again!"
V199,PYRÁ,"We held our wedding reception at Pyra. We booked the entire venue, with the upstairs loft serving as a dance floor with bar and downstairs having tables and seating for guests.  Canapes were served upstairs and a buffet dinner was served downstairs.  We lucked out with great April weather, so guests were also able to enjoy Pyra’s patio and additional space on Lonsdale Road. We were very happy with our decision to have our reception at Pyra, and many of our guests commented on how lovely the space was, how nice the staff were, and how delicious the food was.
 
The venue:
The space is gorgeous with lots of natural light upstairs.  Guests arrived at 4pm but we had the venue for the entire day, and Pyra gave our florist access earlier to set up beautiful flower arrangements and candles - it looked stunning.  Pyra set up our welcome sign and card box too. The venue also accepted delivery of our cake on the morning of the wedding which was a huge help, set it up very nicely upstairs, and cut it for us after the formal “cake cutting” shots.  We were able to coordinate with Pyra ahead of time to arrange the space how we wanted, such as how many tables we wanted downstairs and the set-up of the loft upstairs.  They even had a microphone ready for us upstairs so we could say a few words to our guests before our cake cutting. Perfect! For the evening dancing, we were able to set the disco lighting to our colour scheme, which worked really well with candles and foliage (latter 2 provided by our florist).
 
The food:
The buffet dinner was fantastic.  Pyra gave us multiple menu items to choose from and we were able to fix a nice menu that took into account guests’ dietary restrictions.  We initially booked the venue when it had a different chef and menu.  We came in a few months before our wedding to try the new menu – our dinner was delicious then and there was no dip in quality for the buffet-style served at our reception. Fionn worked with us how to plan best - because we wanted a relaxed style with a dance floor upstairs, we ended up feeding our 80 guests in two sittings downstairs, which worked perfectly. The upstairs space can seat 60 people, which didn’t work for how we planned our event, but does look really nice in photos. The late night food served around 10pm also went down very well.
 
The staff:
The staff, including the bartenders and waiters, were hardworking, friendly and very nice to guests.  Enough staff were around that guests never had to wait long for drinks.  Members of staff cut our cake for us and also boxed up the late night food for guests to bring home.  Fionn, the day-of coordinator, was on-site for our entire reception and was very helpful, even helping coordinate our midnight bus arrival.
 
Responsiveness:
Overall we were happy with the responsiveness of the venue.  It took a little while to nail down the final details of the food menu and drinks menu/bar tab but we were ultimately very happy with the result.  As the venue hosts more weddings/ larger-scale events we’d expect this will improve.

Overall:
We highly recommend Pyra for a wedding reception. We had 80 guests in total, which worked very well for the canapes/cocktail hour upstairs (4-6pm), sit-down buffet downstairs (6-8pm, split into two seatings) and dancing upstairs (8pm-midnight).  The upstairs loft was able to fit all 80 guests plus a four-piece band.  Lonsdale Road is also a charming street that provided great photo opportunities.  We looked into several other venues, and came away happy with Pyra's quote – we were able to book the venue, food (including canapes, dinner and late night food) and a generous bar tab for roughly the amount some other London venues were charging for just their space (no food or drink included). We and our guests had a fantastic time. Thanks so much to Fionn and the Pyra team :)"
V199,PYRÁ,"We had our wedding celebration at Lula. We booked the loft and restaurant for this.

Positives:
The venue is beautiful and needs minimal decoration.
The food was amazing; the chef is truly professional and everyone loved it.
They redecorated the restaurant section and added a set of couches to make it a lounge, which was beautiful.
The staff was very hardworking, professional, and lovely.

They provided us with a lounge, a wedding breakfast space and a dance floor.

Flexibility with Cake:
The bakery was scheduled to deliver and set up the cake at 16:45, but they delivered it at 09:45 instead. The Lula team handled the situation professionally by storing the cake and setting it up at the correct time. They presented the cake beautifully and assisted in cutting it into nice pieces. It could not have been more perfect.


The list of available drinks was huge, and they were happy to make custom drinks and bring in different juices if requested in advance. The event manager tried to accommodate every wish we had, and on the day we could not have hoped for more. Most of our guests said it was one of the best weddings and most beautiful venues they had ever been to.

Negatives:
Food tasting for the wedding menu was not included, which we had assumed would be, but it was given at a 50% discount. We had to sort out the floral decoration last minute, as they had initially suggested they would arrange it for us after providing a budget, but later said we needed to find our own. At times, they were a bit slow to respond, which made us anxious, but after communicating with them, this was resolved, and communication was very swift.

In conclusion:
Lula gave us the most beautiful wedding we could have dreamt of. We highly recommend them. The venue, the food, the service were amazing, and we could not have hoped for more."
V200,Sandon Manor,"We had such a special wedding at Sandon Manor, the team made every effort to make our day so so special and we will be forever grateful for that. A dream team! The day ran so smoothly and they worked so hard. The venue is unique with lots of different spaces which unfold throughout the day, which was perfect as our wedding fell on a wet and windy autumnal day. We would highly recommend Sandon Manor!"
V200,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor provided the perfect venue for our wedding. From the initial conversations and meetings with the team, we knew we were in safe hands and had made the right choice. They kept us informed with any events, made information a bit payments clear and reassured us with any query we had.
The accommodation was exceptional and fitted our requirements perfectly, with high quality finishing touches throughout to ensure our stay was as comfortable as possible.
The wedding venue was incredible! Our ceremony took place in the gorgeously modern barn with stunning draping and greenery. Following on, we had a blissful drinks reception which was on the expertly manicured lawn (with mini golf!) and sun-trap of a courtyard. We then moved onto our wedding breakfast which was held in the main barn, seating all of our guests comfortably with space for decor and extra details. Following from dinner, the part started and the club room came to life! This was absolutely the talking point of the day and our guests raved about how incredible it was! It managed to create a club-like atmosphere, whilst maintaining the vibe, albeit at a reduced volume, in the rest of the barn. The layout of the venue was important to us, as it ensured our guests never strayed too far, to keep the momentum of the day.
The team at Sandon worked superbly with all of vendors which ensured the day ran smoothly from set up to clearing. All of our vendors commented on how much they too loved working there.
The venue, the aesthetics, the staff, everything was perfect! We would absolutely recommend to anyone getting married."
V200,Sandon Manor,"We cannot recommend Sandon Manor enough. From the quality of the service, the helpfulness and friendliness of the team, the beautiful accommodation and the most amazing venue which all or guests loved partying the night away in. To make it even more special the Manor is in amazing grounds in beautiful countryside and nature reserves.
Sandon Manor made our dream come true."
V200,Sandon Manor,"I couldn't recommend Sandon Manor highly enough - from our first enquiry to our Wedding, nothing was too much trouble. The team are so friendly and easy to communicate with, very approachable and responsive. They respond to any questions immediately and having the day before to set up with Tom was fantastic. Styaying in the Manor House and Dovecote was the icing on the cake as to be with friends and family the night before and the day after was so fabulous. On the day Tom and the team were absolutely fantastic and couldn't have done more to make our special day. We couldn't have dreamt of anywhere more perfect than Sandon Manor - a huge thank you to all the staff."
V200,Sandon Manor,"If you are considering Sandon Manor for your wedding venue, I beg you: scratch it off your list now. Yes, the house and grounds are beautiful, but the people behind it are absolutely awful. They ruined our wedding experience.

I will get straight to it. Sandon Manor has a very strict policy on guests leaving the site by 11:30pm (and no one is allowed back to the Manor unless they’re official guests staying overnight). We had lots of international guests at our wedding. Many hadn’t seen each other in years and would be jetlagged - we thought they may be keen to continue chatting after 11:30pm. With this in mind, we made a booking with Sandon Village Hall via our contacts at the church (where we were attending services and later married). They granted us access to the village hall until 1am as a contingency spill over space.

We mentioned this in passing during our online meeting with one of the Sandon Manor team a month before our wedding. Within hours, I received a voicemail from the lady in charge of Village Hall bookings saying (quote) “someone at Sandon Manor is trying to throw a spanner into the works for you”. It soon transpired that they had raised an official complaint to the parish council and pressurised the village hall team into cancelling our booking. To be clear, Sandon village Hall and Sandon Manor are entirely separate entities – there is no crossover between them whatsoever, as the owner of Sandon Manor later acknowledged.

It gets worse. Gob smacked, we asked Kate – the owner of Sandon Manor – for a call to find out what was going on. She was abhorrent, trying to justify her meddling as a necessary measure to protect her wedding license (side note: with Sandon Manor it is always about the money – once your deposit is paid they care nothing for your ‘special day’; you are just another cash cow). Did she apologise for stabbing us, her clients, in the back? No, she did not. She could not even fathom how hurt we were by being completely bypassed in the communication chain and how deceitful and disrespectful this was. My husband and I were quite literally left speechless. We’ve never experienced this sort of treatment from anyone, let alone our wedding venue - to whom we were paying many thousands of pounds. Dealing with this stress in the final month of wedding prep really took its toll on us and soured things. We no longer looked forward to our day, rather dreaded what Sandon Manor might do next.

Aside from this major incident, there were many other occasions when Sandon Manor were unhelpful and unfeeling in their interactions with us:

- We enquired if it would be possible to arrange a large pizza takeaway order instead of using Sandon Manor’s caterer for our late night food. One of the team explained on a call that this wasn’t contractually possible; we acknowledged this. We then received an email saying ‘If you are unable to follow this or any other of our T&C's we would be happy to cancel your booking.’ This was less than a month before our wedding.
- We had a harpist perform in the church. We were told she wasn’t allowed to play during our drinks reception in the grounds due to potential noise complaints (an acoustic harp at 2pm in the afternoon). No other music was permitted outside the house.
- Sandon Manor is an incredibly expensive (in hindsight, grossly overpriced) venue. But we were also hit with hidden fees when booking their accommodation option - an extra £425 ‘cleaning fee’ was added to our bill.
- At the time of booking, Sandon was running a promotion waivering the £700 fee for hiring their ceremony space. As we were marrying at the church, we asked if it would please be possible to put this towards other elements of our day i.e. using their festoon string of lights in the barn (for which they charge £450). They refused.
- We were unsure about booking the 1-bed Dovecote on the grounds as - at £499 for the weekend - it was a considerable expense. While we were deciding Sandon Manor rented it out on Air BnB (to one of our guests, which made for a very awkward conversation).

To summarise, you only get one wedding day. Kate and her team absolutely ruined ours. There are so many other lovely venues in north Hertfordshire run by decent, humane people. Please prioritise your happiness and choose wisely. I wish we had."
V200,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor is a stunning wedding venue with a great team behind it. The exclusive use of the manor for the weekend was a highlight, allowing us to relax with friends and family in the lead up to and after the big day. The Sandon team were brilliant, guiding us through the planning process and ensuring everything ran smoothly on the day. We couldn't have asked for a better place and team to help us celebrate our big day."
V200,Sandon Manor,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our special day. Holly, Tom and the rest of the brilliant team made us feel welcome from day one. Special mention to Tom for making the day run so seamlessly, so professional and accommodating of all our needs.

The venue itself is stunning, located in the beautiful Hertfordshire countryside. The Manor House makes for a tremendous location to prepare, and the Dovecote suite is a nice touch: a great addition for the groom to spend the last night. We loved the small details of the characteristic main venue, with the botanical feel to the bar a great backdrop to the barn.

It’s a shame we can’t stay every week!

Dan & Suzanne"
V200,Sandon Manor,"To Holly, Louise, Tom & Kate, wow, what can we say but the biggest thank you for the best day of our lives! When we viewed the beautiful venue over two years ago we just knew instantly Sandon Manor was the one, not just because it’s stunning, but you guys are amazing! Thank you for making all our wedding dreams come true. Forever grateful and can’t wait to return to reminisce. Lots of love, the new Mr & Mrs Jakes xxx"
V200,Sandon Manor,"From the moment we visited Sandon Manor we knew this would be our wedding venue for 9 September 2023. Seeing the spectacular finish of the house carry through to the completed venue just shows the high level of attention to detail this venue had to offer.

Holly, Tom and the rest of the team filled us with confidence right from our first interactions, annd went above and beyond on the wedding weekend itself to facilitate us, our suppliers and guests. The main house, dovecote, annex and extensive grounds were a wonderful way to have close family stay with us on site, and so handy to be able to all get ready nearby the morning of.

Thank you for making our wedding weekend a truly memorable occasion, for us and our families. We all look back on this day with the happiest, sunniest memories and Sandon Manor will always have a very special place in our hearts."
V200,Sandon Manor,"We had the most amazing wedding weekend at Sandon Manor.

The venue itself is the perfect backdrop for a wedding, our photos looked amazing from every single angle. There were so many spaces to make use of throughout the day which helped things to run incredibly smoothly and meant we didn’t need to have a ‘turnaround’ during the evening. The spaces really wowed our guests and created such a lovely atmosphere. Including the ‘club room’ dance floor that had our guests dancing until the very last song!

We stayed at the Manor House for the weekend, extending our wedding into a perfect weekend retreat. The house itself is beautiful, with lots of different areas for everyone to relax, and the perfect peaceful location to chill the night before the big day!

From our first viewing to checking out the day after our wedding, the Sandon staff were attentive, friendly and helped us feel relaxed and looked after throughout an otherwise overwhelming process. We’d highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for a beautiful, peaceful and unique wedding venue!"
V201,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Thank you so much to the entire team for making our wedding so special! Thanks to Donique, MJ, Mo, Harry and everyone else for helping us organise our day and for their professional but friendly attitude. Merchant Taylors is such a beautiful venue and offers a brilliant layout and different spaces to make the day so special!"
V201,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you all so very much for such an amazing wedding on Saturday. You all worked tirelessly to make it so special. Everything was truly wonderful and you all did me proud! Both Hugh and I couldn’t have asked for anything more in terms of being so well looked after. Our guests were so impressed and have given us so many compliments on a brilliantly well run event. Thank you all again for playing a brilliant part in our truly wonderful day of which we loved every minute
V201,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you so much for the most wonderful wedding reception at the end of April. We had the perfect day and our guests all commented on how well looked after they has been. Thank you again for all your hard work!
V201,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"We know this is very late (we have no excuse), but we wanted to say thank you for everything you and the team at Merchant Taylor's did for us on our wedding day. All the guests have since told us how much they loved the venue, food and service. Fingers crossed you get a few couples getting in touch! Again, Thank You for everything!"
V201,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"My brother and I attended the wedding today, as Florist's for the wedding party.
We were treated fantastically well by ALL the staff that we met, nothing was too much trouble and they made our task a COMPLETE pleasure.
If this is how they treat the actual wedding party then you will have a unforgettable time. Many thanks to all the staff for helping us to do our job with ease ."
V201,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Zara,

Can we thank you and your team at Merchant Taylor’s Hall for all your hard work in making Caroline and Neil’s recent wedding so very special. You, in particular, were able to deal with every question and request in a really professional manner.

Merchant Taylors’ Hall is part of the rich panoply of history and tradition, which makes this great City. All of our guests, and in particular those from abroad, were totally spell bound by the atmosphere, the food and service.

James was superb in organising the whole operation. To turn the Great Hall from a wedding ceremony hall to a banqueting suite for 110 guests, including flowers, place settings and dance floor in ninety minutes was truly remarkable.

The food and wine was of an amazing standard, we know that Merchant Taylors’ Hall has a reputation for presenting some of the finest dining in the City of London. You certainly surpassed all expectations.

We have many wonderful memories of the 10th September 2016, but it is best summed up by our daughter Caroline, “Can we do it all over again?”."
V202,Garden Museum,I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate everything that you did to make our party such a success last Friday. It was brilliant being outside on such a lovely everning. Everyone was very impressed with the venue.
V202,Garden Museum,"Thank you for all your help, advice and on-the-day support, it really made our wedding very special and it certianly went off without a hitch! The Museum looked amazing and the garden was perfect, especially as the sunshine adn the guests wanted to make the most of the beautiful surroundings."
V203,Clearwell Castle,"Can’t tell you how wonderful the team were at Clearwell. Our wedding coordinator Phaedra was exceptional. Attention to detail and everyone of the team from front of house, waiting staff, groundsmen and the DJ made our day absolutely everything we dreamed of and unique to us.

Can’t recommend highly enough and cost was outstanding value for money.

So many our guest commented on the quality of the food and that it was the best wedding they had been too! The children loved the magic of the castle and opportunity to get outside and see the grounds.

The grooms family had a fabulous time staying in the cottages the night before and our guests at both the Castle & the Wyndham had a fabulous stay on the night of the wedding.

Wish we could do it all again!"
V203,Clearwell Castle,We had our wedding at Clearwell in June and we couldn’t recommend it highly enough. From start to finish everything was perfect and they went above and beyond to ensure we had an amazing day. I’d not hesitate in recommending them to any couples. Just a gorgeous place with staff that really care in making your day all that you hope it will be.
V203,Clearwell Castle,"From the moment we first visited Clearwell, we knew this was the venue for us. From the moment we started planning to the final touches on the day, all the staff were fantastic. Ann, our wedding coordinator, was a delight to work with throughout. Nothing was too much trouble and she kept us updated throughout. The day was tailored exactly to our needs and when we arrived at the venue on the day they had prepared everything perfectly.

We did the night before package which included rooms and food the evening before. We were supplied with so much food no one went hungry. The rooms in the Wyndham and the Castle are fantastically appointed.

The venue itself is gorgeous. The cellar bar downstairs adds a whole different dimension to the occasion where you can really let your hair down.

This was an absolute dream come true venue for us. We loved every single minute."
V203,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot fault this venue at all. We initially had to change our wedding date because of lockdown and they were so supportive and empathetic.
Ann, our coordinator, is quite possibly the loveliest person on the planet. She was always happy to answer any questions and it never felt like we were being a nuisances or asking a silly question.
On the morning of the wedding she was a lovely calm presence and the whole day just ran like clockwork.
The food was out of this world with many guests saying it was the best food they’d had at a wedding and one person actually thought we’d hired a Michellin Chef!
The venue is so so beautiful with plenty of space. The downstairs cellar was a great place to party the night away, it was like an exclusive nightclub. There were lots of quieter rooms for people who wanted some peace.
The DJ was brilliant, we forgot to give a list of songs we liked but he did a great job of guessing what we liked ( he must’ve looked at our age and figured nineties dance music was our era. And he was bang on the money)
I do not have a single complaint about this venue"
V203,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot speak highly enough about Clearwell Castle as a wedding venue. The venue itself is absolutely stunning. It rained on our wedding day but the indoor space was so vast and beautiful that ourselves and our guests still had the most amazing time! Our wedding co-ordinator, Phaedra, was absolutely incredible, both before and during the wedding. She was always so professional, replied to all of my emails (there were many) and answered all queries efficiently. On the day, we genuinely could not have managed without her. The day flowed so well with her guidance and it really helped me as the Bride as I felt I didn't need to worry about anything! All the other staff at Clearwell and at the Wyndham hotel were also so wonderful! Everyone worked so hard and every member of staff was so kind to us; it just made our day incredibly special and we are so appreciative to them all. The food was great, service very quick and all the guests really enjoyed it! We had so many compliments about the staff and venue! I honestly could not recommend Clearwell castle more as a wedding venue!"
V203,Clearwell Castle,"Our wedding on 10/11/23 was just the absolute perfect day from start to finish. Our wedding planner manager, Hannah, was incredible, not just on the day but throughout the whole planning process. She ensured everything ran smoothly on the day, sparing no details ensuring everything was just perfect and to time but without being stressful. She was very accommodating with the planning meetings working around both mine and my now Husband's shift patterns.
We both stayed the night before our wedding and the night of the wedding with many of our guests travelling a distance so also staying in the Wyndham which was very convenient. Staying in Keepers cottage with the Bridesmaids the night before added to the experience with the added feature of the hot tub, the groomsmen were very jealous. The beds were very comfortable and everyone was excited to stay in a castle.
On the day of the wedding, the staff were very accommodating moving the bridal party along to the bridal suite to finish preparations earlier than originally planned. The breakfast provided was the perfect amount for a busy morning getting ready. Everything, including the gardens, were immaculately kept adding to the WOW factor of getting married in a Castle.
The canapes served and welcome drinks were well received by the guests and ourselves whilst we had photographers prior to the wedding breakfast. The food was phenomenal and great portions and I was stuffed after. The staff were very accommodating for us with a lot of people with allergies, dislikes of mushrooms so adapting the menu for these individual people. We were even able to swap out a few bottles of wine included in our package for cocktails as us as the Bride and Groom did not drink wine.
As soon as we walked in the venue the first time, we knew it was the place we wanted to get married. Everytime we went back to view the venue again I fell more and more in love. For anyone thinking about viewing or even booking this incredible venue I would say do it! We will be going back for events in the future to relive the best day of our lives."
V203,Clearwell Castle,"We got married at Clearwell castle April 2023. What can I say it's the most perfect venue and we had the most amazing day. The organisation was amazing and the staff were great on the day and even leading up to the big day. Phaedra was our wedding planner and communication with her was great throughout and on our wedding day she ensured that it all ran smoothly. I cannot recommend Clearwell castle and their staff enough. Thank you again for helping us have our dream wedding.
Kind regards

Vanessa & David x"
V203,Clearwell Castle,"We had the most amazing wedding day on the 24th of November 2023, the whole day ran so smoothly and all our guests absolutely loved the venue. The food was amazing and our guests loved the fish and chip buffet in the evening! The whole progress of planning the wedding was so straight forward and Phedera was a great wedding manager."
V203,Clearwell Castle,"Clearwell Castle exceeded all our expectations for our wedding day. The moment we stepped onto the grounds, we were captivated by its timeless charm. The staff, especially Hannah, went above and beyond to make every detail perfect, ensuring a seamless and stress-free experience. The Ball Room, where we exchanged our vows, felt like something out of a storybook. The surrounding gardens provided a stunning backdrop for photos and added to the overall enchantment of the day. Our guests were equally impressed, and many commented on the unique and romantic atmosphere. Choosing Clearwell Castle was the best decision we made for our special day; it truly felt like a fairy-tale come to life."
V203,Clearwell Castle,"We had the perfect wedding at Clearwell Castle, their team were superb in providing planning assistance from the point of our booking, guidance on all aspects of our wedding choices from registrars and suppliers, and coordination on the day of the wedding to make sure it flowed seamlessly. It was a beautiful day, and we couldn't be happier with our choice of Wedding location."
V204,Inner Temple,We got married here in 2023. Everything was perfect and the team made sure the day/food etc was just as we wanted it. Particular thanks to Priya and Eva (Pegasus) for their hard work making our wedding day and lead up so special.
V205,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"I got married at Dodford Manor in February this year. A great time was had by all and I will be recommending the venue to any friends planning weddings.

The weather was bad on the day so we didn’t get to use the outside area very much, but it didn’t matter as the inside is so lovely.

Sky was really helpful and put me at ease on the day. Questions in the lead up and on the day were answered quickly and I was made to feel like the only bride in the world!"
V205,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford was the first venue we looked at shortly after we got engaged. The staff were friendly and relaxed when we had a tour, I knew it was the place for us! I think Lydia telling my now husband that we couldn’t have fireworks due to the animals nearby but we could have a fire performer outside, sold the deal for us! I got an amazing fire performer as a surprise for my husband and the guests after we had sparklers, and it just completed an amazing day!
We heard such positive things Dodford about how professional and smooth running weddings have been from our suppliers, and you guys didn’t disappoint. You handled the day so well, we didn’t worry about a thing and just enjoyed ourselves the whole day.
We honestly had so many lovely messages and conversations after our wedding about how the venue was amazing, everything and everyone was catered for, from my 88 year old Nan, to young children who could play and enjoy the outdoors with a scoop of amazing ice cream. We honestly couldn’t have asked for a better day, we would do it again in a heartbeat if we could! Thank you for making the day so seamless! We are eternally grateful to everyone at Dodford for making our dreams come true becoming Mr and Mrs Price!"
V205,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford Manor what an incredible venue, from initial enquiry to booking, Dodford and the staff were so accommodating and well organised. Nothing was ever too much trouble, even if emails were being sent at 11pm. The day itself, wow it was absolutely incredible, as our wedding was on a budget and due to small numbers Dodford were amazing at setting out our decorations, everything was absolutely perfect and a special shout out to Kayleigh who was amazing on our wedding day. She kept us on time, always checking we were okay and just such a lovely person and really made our day perfect. Would highly recommend a Dodford to any couple due to be married they make the planning and the day an absolute dream and we want to relive it over again."
V205,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"It goes without saying that Dodford is a fab venue.... stunning set up, well maintained, clean, perfect grounds etc... but the best thing about Dodford is the team! I had super high expectations of any wedding venue I booked as I used to run a wedding venue myself (potential nightmare client 😂).... from the 1st viewing the team were fantastic. Relaxed, stress free, organised, professional, knowledgeable, flexible but mostly importantly friendly which gave me complete confidence in them delivering my perfect day.
In the run up to the big day the team are super responsive on email and phone We didn't meet our Event Manager, Lydia, until the day but I was always confident that they work as a whole team and therefore having 1 point of contact was not necessary at all.
In the day Lydia was amazing! Still relaxed and professional and the whole day ran so smoothly. Every requirement was perfect, on time, delivered exceptionally.
We had the best day, thank you to the whole team (especially Lydia!)
Vic & Tony

V205,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We honestly can’t say thank you enough for how amazing Dodford Manor Barn was, along with all the incredible staff who helped make our day truly unforgettable.

From the moment we visited, we fell in love with the beautiful landscapes, open-plan barns, and stunning large windows that flooded the space with natural light. The venue package was one of the best we saw during our search—it felt like everything we could possibly need was covered.

The team at Dodford Manor Barn were incredibly friendly and supportive throughout the entire planning process. Communication was open and consistent, which made everything feel so much more manageable and stress-free. We were even able to find all of our wonderful vendors through Dodford Manor Barn, which was a huge bonus!

As a bride who suffers from anxiety, I was unwell on the morning of the wedding. But I have to give special thanks to Kayleigh and our vendors, who were absolutely amazing and supported me through every step—they helped me feel calm, cared for, and ready to enjoy the day.

Our guests couldn’t stop talking about how stunning the venue was and how lovely the food turned out. We were also lucky enough to have sunshine all day, topped off with a beautiful sunset in the evening—it truly felt magical.

Thank you again, Dodford Manor Barn, for being such a perfect place to start our next chapter.

With love,
Carter & Emmie (24.03.2025) x"
V205,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"From the moment we booked our wedding at Dodford Manor, we knew we were in good hands—but nothing could have prepared us for just how extraordinary the experience would be. Every single detail was handled with such precision, care, and genuine warmth that it truly felt like a dream come to life.

The venue itself is breathtaking, but what made our day unforgettable was the impeccable service. The entire team operated like a well-oiled machine, making sure everything ran smoothly while keeping the atmosphere joyful and stress-free. Their attention to detail was second to none—no request was too big or too small.

We want to give a heartfelt, special shoutout to *Lydia*, our incredible Wedding Manager. From our first meeting to the final dance, she was nothing short of amazing. Lydia went above and beyond at every turn—anticipating needs before we even voiced them, coordinating flawlessly with suppliers, and offering support with a calming confidence that put us completely at ease, (apart from making me cry the second I saw her! 😂). Her passion for what she does shone through in every interaction, and our day would not have been the same without her.

Thanks to this amazing venue and its phenomenal team (especially Lydia!), we were able to truly enjoy every moment of our wedding, knowing everything was in the best possible hands. If you're considering this venue for your big day—don’t hesitate. It’s everything you hope for, and more.

We want to do it over and over!
A day we will NEVER forget!!

Thank you again and all our Love,
Mr & Mr Pargeter-Prince

V205,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We booked Dodford Manor in Feb 2024 after we viewed the space, for our wedding in March 2025. It was the only venue we viewed, but instantly fell in love with the character and variety of spaces the venue had to offer. The free corkage also really appealed to us as a great way for us to bring our own drinks at a good cost.

From start to end, the team were amazing, helping us with the planning of the day and making sure we had a great array of suppliers we could work with. The live band was a huge part of our day, and Dodford have a great mixture of acts on their supplier list.

On the day of the wedding, the groomsmen arrived at the venue to help with set up to see that our amazing event manager, Kayleigh had every single aspect of the day in hand and sorted. She sorted all table settings, decor, stationary - Everything!! Nothing was too much to ask of her and the Dodford team. The day ran impeccably well, with everything being on time and everything we asked for being sorted. Our drinks were served chilled, on time and were always around. It’s easy for venues who offer free corkage to try and limit you drinking your own drink - Not here!! There was constantly beers being topped up, wine bottles replaced and aperol spritz being taken round. Cannot fault them!

The team packed all of our bits away and ready for us to collect the next morning. We are very aware Dodford is a busy venue and wanted to make sure we wasn’t just “another wedding” but at no point was that the case. We felt like we were the one and only wedding and genuinely could not ask for more!

Thank you so so much for everything, Highly recommended!!"
V205,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We got married her a month ago today and had the most amazing day with them. Jess, Jack and the team made sure that everything ran smoothly and that they were doing everything they could for us on the day. We would 100% recommend them for anyone wishing to marry in such a beautiful setting."
V205,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We had been apprehensive booking Dodford for our reception that it was so popular in Northamptonshire that our wedding could end up looking the same as a lot of others we knew of, as we're local - but that was a ridiculous thing to worry about! The level of flexibility/customisation you get with Dodford is unmatched in our opinion; as it's such a beautiful venue to start with, you don't have to work hard to make it look good before adding in your personality as a couple!

The whole process from enquiries to final planning and the execution on the day were great. We did have a slight issue with them not inviting us to a food tasting in enough time before our wedding date (whether they forgot/we were missed off a list we don't know) but when we did raise it they invited us to a tasting at their sister venue instead (it's 2 hours away but we were available to travel thankfully). Every member of staff we encountered in our experience with Dodford were so friendly and make you feel like you are the only couple that matters for them in that moment, which we really appreciated from such a popular/busy venue. Abbie was our Event Manager on the day and provided such an elevated level of service, nothing was too much trouble and she executed our plans/vision to a tee, adding in some extra details that we loved too.

Our wedding was in December 2024, and we only had our reception at Dodford, so the ceremony barn was set up for our drinks reception with plenty of space for guests without it feeling cramped or equally like we were all rattling around in there (we had 75 guests for our reception). They don't have many photos of indoor drinks receptions in their promo so I was a little worried how it would look but the team had it set up beautifully. We also had a brass band on the mezzanine level which was really fun and festive!

What sold Dodford for us was the no daytime corkage, which meant we could really personalise our drinks reception and wedding breakfast drinks without breaking the bank. There was a slight disconnect with how and when we had requested/planned to serve some of the drinks in our planning meeting and what happened on the day, which we think may have been a slight hiccup in communication between Dodford and Jenkinsons (the caterers), but it didn't have a negative impact on our day at all!

Overall, there's a reason this is such a popular venue - it is truly perfect!"
V205,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,Dodford manor is an amazing wedding venue. From the very beginning when we first stepped into the venue to look around we fell in love. We knew we had to have our wedding there. After booking the venue we had amazing contact with the staff from booking our food tasting session. To a general email to see how our wedding planning was going. The planning meeting was well organised and we were able to talk through exactly what we wanted and no want was too big for the team.
V206,Gosfield Hall,"I never imagined my wedding would be somewhere as stunning as Gosfield hall but from the minute we saw this venue we knew it was the one for us and didn't bother viewing anymore venues as we had already made our minds up about having our wedding here! We were absolutely blown away with the natural beauty of Gosfield hall and so booked two years in advance of our wedding day! The professionalism and advice we received from Linda was super helpful and informative on the run up to our wedding as there is soo much to think about! We loved that we could have our day and evening all in one place aswell as the option weather permitting to have our wedding ceremony outside. I'm pleased to say the weather was absolutely perfect on our wedding day and we got to have our fairytale wedding outside! The package we paid for was well worth the money! Our guests were absolutely spoilt on our day and have all said it was the best wedding they've ever been too! It was amazing to have our guests stay over aswell! Jocie our wedding planner was absolutely amazing! She was sooo friendly and super accommodating and went above and beyond on our day to make it absolutely perfect with no hiccups! She even helped dress me on the day as she knew how to do up a corset dress and my mother didn't have a clue lol she made all my wedding details and decorations come to life and done such a stunning job decorating our dream venue aswell as being super supportive towards me my family and guests! The honeymoon suite is the best we've ever seen and completely took ours and our guests breaths away! Mind blowing! The food,venue,grounds,accomodation and night before accomodation were absolutely stunning and we want to thank everyone at Gosfield hall for making our day soo incredible and special and a day we and our guests will never forget! We can't wait to return to Gosfield! Thank you everyone at Gosfield what an amazing place!"
V206,Gosfield Hall,"We had previously experienced Gosfield Hall as a guest before deciding on it for our anniversary.

Our day was beautiful and went according to plan. Our guests all had great feedback about the day.

The only thing we would have changed would have been more diverse menu for the main meals."
V206,Gosfield Hall,"Gosfield hall is a beautiful location for a wedding and their packages cover all the important stuff! We didn’t have to worry about caterers, wedding coordinator or a DJ - all included! Great service, lovely food and everyone really enjoyed the day! Our coordinator Jocie was fab on the day, getting everything organised and fetching anything we needed. Couldn’t have asked for better, she knew the time line and the day flowed really smoothly!"
V206,Gosfield Hall,"We got married at Gosfield Hall and everything about it was perfect from when we arrive to view it, booking, the communication and Faye Carter our wedding Coordinator! If you want the best wedding day with no hassle, Gosfield is your place!!"
V206,Gosfield Hall,"Myself and my Wife have just got married at Gosfield Hall,
Our expensive started when we viewed the venue and we first met Linda sales manager, she welcome us in & made us feel at home, we wasn’t sure how, but she made us feel calm like this was where we was meant to be.
Once we looked around at all the venue has to offer we had already made a decision as this is such a stunning location and instantly new this was what we wanted! It was just right for us.

We did not get made to feel pressured to make any decisions immediately however we did end up booking our big say within the next few days after our visit.

Our next contact was with Ellie our wedding planner, she was very helpful and nothing was ever to much, we enjoyed the food tasting at the venue and was very impressed with the experience, it was out of this world.
Ellie helped us through all of our problems and made sure all of our plans come to life.

Now on our big day, what can I say? The staff were amazing, Ellie couldn’t have done enough every time you wanted to ask a question she was next to us any time we needed something. She was there all the way through the day/ night & even the next morning, Ellie made our day Run seamlessly.
We’ve been to many weddings before but never have we had food as amazing as we did here.
Every guest was amazed at the food quality and commented on how delicious it was!
Just to sum up if you’re thinking about booking your wedding at Gosfield Hall don’t question it just book it. You will be amazed."
V206,Gosfield Hall,"The venue is stunning and was the perfect setting for our winter wedding (so much natural light even in January). Jocie Golbourn was our assigned wedding planning specialist and she is so kind, sweet, patient and professional. All our guests loved the venue but many actually commented on how flawless and seamless the day was organised and rooms decorated and prepared from each section of the wedding and we only have Jocie and venue staff to thank for their meticulous planning and preparations. The food and drinks were delicious. Couldn’t recommend this venue enough- we actually booked the venue on a whim and were SO happy when we visited for an open day. There’s no false advertisements- it’s stunning."
V206,Gosfield Hall,"Everything, from start to finish, was exactly what we wanted and more. The preparation was helped by our wonderful personal manager, Tara, and accommodated each and every one of our requests and needs. The venue is gorgeous, food delicious, and atmosphere felt special. Our friends and family all told us that this was such a spectacular wedding for them that it was the best they've ever been to. We felt completely taken care of, kept us calm and happy throughout the day, and kept all of our suppliers in place and to standard. It felt glamourous and unique. We wish we could relive the day over and over. It really was our dream wedding."
V206,Gosfield Hall,"We got married in Gosfield Hall in May and had the most amazing wedding day that any couple could ask for. The whole experience from the arrival the night before to leaving the day after was seamlessly managed by the team at the venue.
The house and the grounds looked absolutely stunning and Ellie and the team did a brilliant job at keeping the day running smoothly without making anyone feel rushed. Everyone there was immensely friendly and helpful and we really felt that everyone who worked there was invested in making our day feel special.
We fell in love with the venue when we booked it but the whole experience exceeded out expectations so much that we wish we could do it all again!"
V206,Gosfield Hall,"I wanted to take a moment to commend and state our appreciation for Jocie. She truly was phenomenal, approachable and no task was too big.
We had 5 months to plan our wedding and we loved every moment. With us both working in the service industry it was great to have someone who was so switched on and would be an asset to have on any team."
V206,Gosfield Hall,"Having just got married at Gosfield Hall I can honestly say it was the most beautiful venue and the most perfect day. The staff were so attentive and professional. The food was outstanding and the drinks and cocktails were fabulous. They couldn’t do enough to make sure our day was everything we’d dreamt of. I have to say a special thanks to Ellie - one of the wedding coordinators on site - she went above and beyond to help us plan our day and was there from the very moment I woke up delivering fresh pastries for breakfast to the moment she made me a cup of tea to go to bed with. I can’t thank you enough Ellie, you are an absolute credit to Gosfield Hall."
V207,Kingston Estate Totnes,"When I first enquired with Kingston I thought it would be too expensive but we explained what are budget was and when we wanted to get married and they put a quote together that was affordable.
We have just had the most amazing one day wedding which didn't finish until the early hours. We got married in the Long Barn where there are chandeliers running down the middle, it was very romantic. There is this nightclub at Kingston which is very cool which everyone loved. The guests all said the venue was stunning and the food was out of this world.
A few of us stayed the night before and most of our guests stayed the night of the wedding in the cottages and barns. The staff were brilliant and they coordinated the whole day for us. I cant recommend the venue enough."
V207,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had a two day wedding at the Kingston Estate. All our guests were completely blown away by it.
Most of our friends and family had traveled far for the weekend and were not disappointed when then arrived as the cottages and barns are gorgeous. Some even have hot tubs.
Jodie and the Weddings Team organised a welcome party for the first night which was unreal along with providing street style food for everyone around 8.30 pm. At Kingston they have this really cool enormous Yurt and food hut which is used the day before the wedding and for breakfast.
On the wedding day itself we got married in the Walled Garden and there were endless canapes during the drinks reception. We then decided to eat in the Hayloft Barn which has glass windows overlooking all the gardens.
We used the clear span marquee for our reception party and had the craziest cover band before we all went into the nightclub until 3 am. The good thing about Kingston is everything is included they let you use things like cake stands, easels, knifes, speakers, microphones, all furniture at no extra cost, they set everything up for you and then clean up afterwards. We didn]t have to do anything which made everything totally stress free.

Thank you Jodie, Ellie and Charlotte it was insane !!"
V207,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had the most magical wedding at Kingston. From the moment we set foot onto the grounds, we knew it was the perfect place for our special day. It was our first viewing… and nothing else compared for us (we saw a total of 6 venues). What stood out to us the most was the variety of spaces available for each part of the day. The selection of ceremony areas, the beautiful outdoor spots for photos, the yurt for the night before party, and a special one for us… the underground nightclub for the evening! As party lovers, this was a part that sold it for us; there was somewhere for every moment.

One of the things we loved most was the flexibility to personalize every aspect of our wedding. The venue truly felt like a blank canvas that we could transform into our dream setting, but equally, we got away with doing absolutely nothing as it was beautiful all on its own.

But what truly made our experience unforgettable was the incredible staff, led by Jodie. They were not only professional and attentive but also genuinely warm and welcoming. Their support and attention to detail ensured that everything ran smoothly, allowing us to relax and fully enjoy our day.

We're hoping to return and stay in the future, for a special occasion.

It's not just a wedding venue; it's a place that holds a special spot in our hearts as the backdrop to the beginning of our happily ever after 🤍"
V207,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Kingston was perfect. Despite a rainy start, the day was amazing and Jodie was available but subtly in the background allowing the day to be ours."
V207,Kingston Estate Totnes,"After over a two and a half year wait due to Covid, our son and his wife had a wonderful wedding weekend. Jodie from Kingston Estate and her team of staff went above and beyond to ensure the wedding ran smoothly. Every detail was dealt with professionally. The accommodation, venue and food were all excellent and all our guests many from overseas had a wonderful time. The only thing Jodie could not oversee was the weather but even a little rain didn't spoil the celebrations."
V207,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue and staff were brilliant from start to finish. The venue is really multi-functional and caters for rain or shine. The weather was really unpredictable around the time of our wedding but I was a stress free bride knowing they had it in hand. The food supplier was stunning - we had a weekend package which all the guests raved about. That coupled with the unlimited drinks pages made it the perfect venue for us. A Devon treasure that feels like being on a film set - everyone loved it!
V207,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Such a beautiful venue - we loved it so much. The food was incredible and despite having a changeover of wedding planner close to the wedding day, it had no impact on our day what so ever. The venue are calm and professional and loved their approach to communication which was friendly."
V207,Kingston Estate Totnes,Fell in love with the venue on our first visit. We were particularly looking for a venue which could cater us for 3 days and sleep the majority of the the guests. The grounds were well kept especially the walled garden which is where the ceremony took place. The team were a pleasure and made the day truly special.
V207,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Our 3-day wedding celebrations were spent at the STUNNING Kingston Estate - a truly unique venue that we absolutely fell in love with. It had EVERYTHING we were looking for & more. The grounds are perfectly manicured all year round & come complete with walled garden. The cottages & main house are beautifully decorated, providing luxurious accommodation for 86 of our guests. Sarah & the team were such a pleasure to work with & couldn’t do enough for us. The catering was also top notch. Thank you"
V207,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue was great we had a few personal health issues beforehand but the team went above and beyond to make the day extra special. The wedding planner organised everything for us and they had plenty of props on site that we were free to use. We had the whole place to ourselves for the weekend it was brilliant and our friends loved the hot tub and pool.
V208,Holmewood Hall,"We were married at Holmewood Hall on 15th February 2025 and I can honestly say that it was the most magical day. We went to visit the venue and instantly fell in love with it but even we were blown away by how beautiful everything looked on the day. All of the staff were amazing - special shoutout to our personal wedding manager, Laura Pike, who was always on hand to answer any questions - she couldn’t do enough for us! The food was wonderful & we had full control over the menu. Would highly recommend this venue, you won’t regret it!"
V208,Holmewood Hall,"Holmewood Hall was an absolutely perfect wedding venue. The house is stunning, well cared for and beautifully decorated. All of the staff are so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Our Wedding Coordinator was fantastic, available from early morning of the wedding and was still there the morning after working for us. The food was excellent, drinks and canapes were amazing and the venue took care of everything for us. We had the most perfect wedding and are so pleased we chose Holmewood Hall. The Gold Room where we had our ceremony is gorgeous. Thank you for giving us a beautiful wedding!"
V208,Holmewood Hall,"I cannot fault this venue at all, the venue itself is breathtakingly beautiful with magnificent rooms and very lovingly maintained grounds. The staff are incredibly friendly, professional and efficient, our wedding coordinator Lee was a pleasure to work with and made our special day run smoothly. If you want a hassle free wedding with breathtaking grounds and the most amazing staff then this is the venue for you."
V208,Holmewood Hall,"Had the most amazing wedding here recently and cannot recommend it enough.

The venue itself is stunning and the options included in the luxe package covered everything we could've possibly wanted and made planning the wedding 100x less stressful.

The staff were all amazing from start to finish, Katie showed us around initially and then Lee was our personal wedding manager, and they were both incredible throughout. Always on hand to answer any questions and help us through the day once we got there.
We had so many comments from our guests on how lovely the staff were on the day!

A particular highlight though was the food - the tasting evening was a dream and the chef went above and beyond to provide a full vegan menu for us which wasn't limited to only a couple of options.
Again, we had so many non-vegan guests complimenting the food and saying how lovely it was!

Overall, an incredible day and an incredible venue.
Thank you so much to everyone there!"
V208,Holmewood Hall,"This place is simply just amazing 🤩
We had our wedding here on 17-12-24 and it was everything we dreamed of and more. The food, staff, decor were just perfect not forgetting the most beautiful Christmas tree 😍
Our person wedding planner Lee was an absolute god send not just having him there on the day but always being at the end of a phone to answer any questions or worry’s.
If we could go back and do it all again we would and not change a single thing.
The most perfect day at the most perfect venue ♥️"
V208,Holmewood Hall,Perfect venue for a wedding with guest numbers 60 - 100. Our guests and I moved from each room to a new room throughout the day and every room had a new surprise. The bridal suite was lush and it was great having all our guests staying under one roof. I would 100% recommend this to anyone.
V208,Holmewood Hall,"The wedding day and lead up to the day were fab. However, for the price we paid, we expected a little bit more.
I opted to use the bridal cottage the evening before for which we paid £450 extra. This is something I now regret, as there was no hot water and we were not able to order any food in as all the take away options were shut (on a Friday night). The hot tub also needed a good clean. So the night before/morning of my wedding was not ideal. I flagged this to the manager who advised that we should have raised the cold water issue as soon as possible, but seeing as we were trying to have morning showers on the wedding day, this did not leave us any time.
Our package included pre-drinks, wine with dinner and we also purchased a cocktail ""cart"" (cocktails on a table) and a bucket of beers. The groom, who is not a wine fan, asked for a beer with his wedding meal and was presented with a contactless card machine to pay for it at the top table. We felt this was a bit unnecessary as there was a full bucket of extra beers outside and it felt a little embarrassing having a card machine presented to us at the top table on our wedding day for one measly Corona, despite the huge amount we had paid. Also, guests were unknowingly allowed to buy beers from the bar after the meal, despite there being available beers to them already in a bucket next to the bar...
Overall the wedding was lovely, but for the price we paid we expected a bit better. Essentially, I loved the venue, but I wish we had not purchased any extras!"
V208,Holmewood Hall,"We got married at Holmewood Hall on 4th October 2024. From the first moment we stepped into the venue and I saw the magnificent Gold room I knew this would be the perfect place for us to get married. We had the most amazing day which was perfectly coordinated by the whole team at Holmewood but especially so by our personal wedding manager Lee. Lee was always quick to respond to any questions we had in the lead up to the day and nothing was too much trouble for him.
We honestly wish we could do it all over again as it was a magical day. We would recommend Holmewood Hall to anyone looking for the perfect venue."
V208,Holmewood Hall,"After getting engaged in late March this year we wanted to get married fairly quickly so booked Holmewood for the same September. The venue, grounds, accomodation were all stunning and we felt very fortunate it was within budget and the package we got was outstanding in comparison to other venues and what it included, which was far far more than other venues. We got to attend a luxe event to choose all our wedding food, canapés, cocktails and wines which should have made things easier but due to the unbelievable quality it made it harder! Our wedding planner Lee is literally the most fantastic person. He was flexible, fun, engaged and on absolutely everything. The day was ran impeccably and also smooth even with some weather concerns and speeches taking a bit longe than we thought. If you book here ask for Lee!! We had the most perfect day. Can’t fault a single things. Our guests all told us how incredible everything was with one even saying he will now longer not attend any further weddings unless it’s at Holmewood. Thank you to all the staff and as mentioned a huge special thank you to Lee! Your a legend!"
V208,Holmewood Hall,"Exceptional venue, stunning grounds, fantastic DJ, and excellent service. Highly recommended! Happiest day of my life 😊"
V209,Bourton Hall,"We got married at Bourton Hall on 08 March 2025 and our wedding planner was Harminder. The day was absolutely amazing from start to finish. All the food and drinks were of a high standard and presented beautifully which includes the wedding breakfast, canapés and cocktails, and breakfast the next day. The venue is gorgeous with lots of rooms, well maintained grounds and exclusive use. The staff are friendly and accommodating and the event was really well managed. We would like to particularly thank Harminder, who was supportive throughout the wedding planning process and the wedding day, ensuring things ran smoothly and in a timely manner. He is a great communicator, provided advice and guidance where needed and attention to detail. We really had a magical day! Thank you so much! We would happily do it all over again and would definitely recommend this venue!"
V209,Bourton Hall,"What a fabulous wedding venue! Because it's a wedding venue and not a hotel that holds the occasional wedding, they really focused on what was important and anticipated our every need. It's an elegant venue but with a comfortable feel to it. The team are incredibly accommodating and helpful and each couple is allocated their own personal wedding manager to guide them through the process and to make sure every detail is covered.
There's a beautiful chapel on site where non-religious ceremonies can be held - this was fabulous.
The food was plentiful and delicious - all our guests raved about it. Great choice of welcome drinks and canapes, wines and cocktails.
The grounds are gorgeous; a perfect backdrop for our October wedding.
The venue was exclusively ours and has beautiful bedrooms, including a huge, stunning bridal suite. Most of our guests stayed overnight and took advantage of the brilliant breakfast in the morning so it really extended the celebration."
V209,Bourton Hall,"Our wedding at Bourton Hall was better than we ever imagined. The Italianate mansion is truly spectacular inside and out however it is the team that made our day run perfectly. Our guests found the setting and the food incredible, they were very impressed! Our wedding planner Emily Sarjant was fantastic her knowledge and expertise made our day magical from start to finish, with all the special touches that she suggested. Our first dance was created in such a beautiful way it will be a memory we cherish forever. Thank you to Emily and the team at Bourton Hall. My husband would also like to note that the croquembouche was amazing and everyone should have one."
V209,Bourton Hall,"My wife and I got married at Bourton Hall in September, with our wedding managed by the wonderful Eleni. Everything about the day went as perfectly as we could've wished, right from arrival to departure the following day. The venue is stunning, and the food was lovely, and having 21 bedrooms on site was such a bonus so that all of our close friends and family could stay on site with us.
Bourton Hall did everything they could both in the run up to the day and on the day itself to alleviate all stress to ensure everything ran as seamlessly as possible, which it absolutely did.
We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall enough."
V209,Bourton Hall,"We were married on 28th July 2024. What an amazing day we had at Bourton Hall. Could not fault it! The venue is so elegant! The grounds and views were to die for. The food was out of this world with so many choices and all cooked and served to perfection. Accommodation / rooms were plentiful and luxurious. Lovely to have a chapel on site too. We had the whole place to ourselves, we felt like royalty! Lots of varied rooms and areas for people to choose where they wanted to be after the wedding breakfast. We would choose the venue all over again!"
V209,Bourton Hall,"We had both our wedding ceremony and reception at Bourton Hall and the service was superb throughout. The house and grounds are beautiful with amazing views to go with them. The staff were professional and helpful during the lead up to our wedding day and during the day as well - even when we had an emergency prior to the ceremony which caused delays, the venue staff were able to work around this to move timings back in order to allow all of our planned activities to go ahead and be fully enjoyed. All the food was delicious and we had a wonderful wedding day thanks to Bourton Hall."
V209,Bourton Hall,"We had the most perfect wedding day at Bourton Hall. Throughout the planning process and on the day, the team were so professional, which meant we could relax and know that everything was in their capable hands - Emily was an amazing wedding manager. The building is beautiful inside and out, and the grounds are stunning - there are so many places for beautiful photos, and views out over the countryside. The food was absolutely delicious, it was so hard to choose what to have! It was also so helpful to have so many places for guests to sit and chat in the evening, away from the disco room but still part of the action. Having so many bedrooms onsite (not to mention a stunning bridal suite!) was an added bonus. We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall highly enough, and have had so many comments from guests saying what a beautiful, elegant but relaxed day it was, so I know they really appreciated everything Bourton has to offer too. Thank you so much to Emily and the whole team for giving us such a perfect day!"
V209,Bourton Hall,"As the Bride and Groom we were made to feel like nothing was too much to ask and they couldn't do enough to make us feel special.
All the guests commented that it was one of the prettiest and most relaxed weddings they have been to.
We could not have asked for a better wedding day thanks to Bourton!"
V209,Bourton Hall,"I had my wedding on 10/02/2024 I am so happy I chose this venue, It is really magical. My wedding manager was just the best! Emily went above and beyond to help me on my big day! I cannot thank her enough.

One of the main things about this venue is that t has its own chappel which is really special and makes you wedding seem more traditional, however there are more options/ rooms available. I wanted the wow factor and I got it.

Some of the options that made it great

*Onsite accommodation for night before and night of the wedding is really helpful
*Exclusive use
*Dedicated wedding manager definate gamechanger! (Emily)
*Menu choices are fantastic.

Everyone commented on the food being really nice ( we had the lamb) The evening buffet was also great. I paid extra to have a meal created as having part of my culture within the food at the wedding was very important to me, they did not disappoint.
Emily was perfect in so many ways, she knew exactly my vision once i explained it to her and she made sure that it became real for me. She adapted parts of the day so that it would work better, for example bringing the canapes outside whilst photos where being taken. Helping me into my dress, looking after my phone just everything I needed she was there. She really worked hard to make sure it run perfectly and it did.

Thank you emily!!! You made my day Great."
V209,Bourton Hall,We got married at Bourton Hall on 30th July 2023. It was the most amazing day ever! We are still receiving compliments from our guests on how stunning the venue was and the whole running of the day. This was 100% down to our wedding co-ordinator Harminder. He went above and beyond to ensure our day was absolutely perfect. He literally could not have done any more! Thank you again Harminder!!
V210,B&H Buildings,Bourne & Hollingsworth was such an exceptional venue for our wedding this September. This is the perfect place for you if you want a true London wedding that feels like a fun dinner/house party but on an epic scale. We used the top floor (the studios) for our sit down dinner (think candle light and tasty roast lamb) and headed downstairs for our reception with the basement club (below and hidden) for late night dancing. The place is stunning (greenery and glass everywhere and the cocktails are insane but what really makes this place are the people. The whole staff from Matt and Lizzie to the bar team to the dinner crew made our whole day seamless and so fun. Could not recommend B&H more highly for your London wedding.
V210,B&H Buildings,"Beautiful wedding celebration in the most stylish venue - we had an intimate wedding reception (drinks, dinner and more drinks!) at the Bourne & Hollingsworth Buildings. The staff members on duty were excellent - nothing was too much trouble and they served everyone with such professionalism. We couldn’t recommend it highly enough and we haven’t stopped talking about it since. All of our guests were so impressed with the space and how stylish it was. The bar, restaurant and greenhouse are all aesthetically beautiful and the botanical vibes make for a very relaxed, but premium setting. Special shout out to Lizzie who helped us coordinate everything and Matt on the day who led the team. Thank you so much - we had the best day and we couldn’t have wished to host it in a better venue."
V210,B&H Buildings,"India & the B&H team were seamless. Flexible, responsive, kind, and easy to deal with. They made our day so special. The food was fantastic, the drinks were lovely, and the value for money was first rate!"
V211,Leez Priory,"I never in my life thought I would get married in a place like Leez priory! The whole experience from start to finish was just fantastic. The price breakdown was manageable and there was no pressure to take any upgrades offered. The things we got in our package were phenomenal and having a wedding planner was tremendous - our lady (Leanne) was an absolute god send!
They catered to all our needs and we were made to feel so comfortable and nothing was a problem! I’d highly suggest going to an event there before hand, just to get a feel of what it’s like full of people and enjoy their delicious food. We actually enjoyed their entertainer ( singer) so much we hired him for our wedding ☺️
Lee priory is just so beautiful. I can’t speak highly enough x"
V211,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory on the 7th of September 2024. Considering how long they have been a wedding venue, they were pretty flexible with some of the ideas we had for the venue styling that turned out amazingly!

The staff really made the day something special and couldn't have done enough for us. Special mention must be made for Leanne, our wedding planner, who was amazing!

Highly recommend the venue and the incredible team that helped to make our day so special!"
V211,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in October 2024. This venue is stunning both inside and out with immaculately kept grounds and interior. The hospitality in the lead up to and on the day of the wedding was fantastic. The food was also brilliant. Another great perk of this venue is the amount of on site accommodation.

A couple of drawbacks / experiences during our wedding. There are only a few toilets in the main building which kept blocking and overflowing throughout the evening which led to us taking some guests to the dressing room or honeymoon cottage to use the facilities. You are also restricted by the venue on any external food or drink suppliers and the venues optional extras for this are quite expensive for what they are.

That asaide, we had the best day and evening at Leez Priory and would certainly recommend it!"
V211,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in August 2024- great venue and experience from initial viewing to leaving the morning after the wedding. Leanne acted as our wedding planner and was friendly, professional and helpful throughout. We opted for the classic package and the food was amazing quality with everyone commenting how full they were!
The venue is beautiful with several options for ceremony both inside and out. Accommodation was great too. The whole day ran smoothly with perfect weather - we will have very happy memories of our day!"
V211,Leez Priory,"Perfect venue and very attentive staff, lovely food and great communication from start to finish"
V211,Leez Priory,"Stunning venue. Fantastic Team. Very accommodating toward our unique ""surprise"" strategy. Our guests were truly surprised. Thank you."
V211,Leez Priory,"Leez priory was the 1st and only venue we looked around when we started planning our wedding. From the moment we stepped on the premises, everything just looked so perfect and exactly what we wanted from a wedding venue. When we got assigned our wedding co-ordinator Rachel, she was just absolutely spot on with everything we asked for and nothing was too big an ask for her. She made sure the day ran as smoothly as possible and took care of any issue that arose without me knowing (which I am forever grateful for!!)
The rest of the staff were amazing and very helpful.

The venue itself is just absolutely stunning and we loved that it has the pub area as well as the dance floor so it catered to all of our guests.

All of the rooms were lovely and it was so nice being able to stay in the fisherman’s lodge onsite the night before the wedding.

We genuinely cannot recommend this venue enough and it was 100% worth the money! 10/10!"
V211,Leez Priory,"We got married on a Tuesday in October to maximise the value of what we could get for our money; and honestly, we got everything we wanted and more. Leanne, our Wedding Manager was perfect at bringing an attention to detail and seamless organisation to the big day, and in the lead up. There wasn't one moment of the day where we felt stressed, as Leanne had it covered. In one particular instance, our flowers for the bridal party's hair hadn't arrived. Within five minutes of telling Leanne that we needed this, the flowers were with our hair and make-up suppliers to add the finishing touches.

Leez Priory as a venue is the most stunning setting, and offers an incredible range of areas in which the ceremony and reception can take place. There is also the opportunity for the bridal party to make use of the Fisherman's Cottage the night before the wedding, and for people to stay in the on-site accommodation on the evening of the wedding, making it the perfect venue for people also travelling from further afield.

Leez Priory were very accommodating, welcoming and were happy to work with us to make our day as perfect as possible. The food was incredible, and a total hit with all of our guests, and so many people have commented on how incredible the day was as a whole. You wouldn't be disappointed to choose Leez Priory."
V211,Leez Priory,They catered to our every need. To when we would ask for things they hadn’t been done before they still made sure it went smoothly. Leanne was amazing she made me feel so comfortable from the start. The whole day was stunning. Beautiful venue please go view it as you will not be disappointed
V211,Leez Priory,We got married on the 26 May 2024. This venue was absolutely brilliant! They catered for every need and made sure there was no stress on the day. Leanne was kind and level headed throughout and was always one step ahead! Do not hesitate to book- do it now!
V212,London Rowing Club,"We picked this place because we wanted somewhere fairly central and casual. We fell in love with the long room and the view. Our wedding was in October so we thought we'd have it cosy but we ended up with a beautiful autumnal day so everyone was on the balcony. The fairy lights were perfect and the other rooms were great to avoid leaving. The staff was so friendly and accommodating that we would definitely recommend the venue.

The only thing that could have tainted the day is that after three visits and many emails, we were never told that the river floods (a lot). We were flexible with our day so if we knew this we would have built it into our day, instead, I was told by the photographer on the day as I got out of the taxi that we wouldn't be able to take any group photos because the area would be flooded during the cocktail hour and half that we had assigned as photo time. This would have been disappointing but we all ended up running outside after the ceremony to take photos before the tide came in. My husband and I borrowed wellies for our couple photos. We had fun doing this, but I can imagine many couples being upset! My friend's electric car also flooded and they were obviously upset."
V212,London Rowing Club,"Annabel was meticulous in her help planning the wedding. Very knowledgeable and helpful.
On the day the rest of the staff were brilliant - there wasn’t an empty glass in the house.
Great venue at a reasonable price on the London riverside."
V212,London Rowing Club,"LRC was the perfect place to celebrate our wedding this summer. The venue staff went above and beyond to ensure that everything went as planned both before and during the event. Thanks in particular to Annabel who was responsive, helpful and always put us at ease in the build up. The location is stunning - couldn’t have asked for a better day!"
V212,London Rowing Club,"We just wanted to say an enormous thank you for everything. From the moment we came to visit the LRC on a slightly grey January weekend, we knew it would be a fabulous venue for our June wedding reception and it certainly did not disappoint. It really is the most beautiful setting and we have very fond memories of our guests enjoying drinks in the sunshine with the most fantastic view over the Thames. The venue has such character and lends itself beautifully to a wedding reception. We have received so many compliments from our guests and I would encourage anyone thinking about booking their wedding at the LRC to do it, you will not regret it! We were lucky to be blessed with beautiful weather so were able to have our jazz musicians play on the balcony for the drinks reception before moving into the Long Room for our meal. It looked stunning with the tables dressed and mantles adorned with flowers. Following the meal and speeches, guests enjoyed drinks back on the balcony and in the Fairburn and Members Rooms which provide plenty of seating, whilst the Long Room was cleared and the band set up. We then partied the night away.

From start to finish, the organisation was so straight forward. Annabel was very accommodating and full of helpful advice in the run up. I knew that on the day she would ensure things ran like clock work, which of course they did. Our suppliers also commented on how helpful the LRC team were to work with. On the day the staff were brilliant and went out of their way to ensure everything ran smoothly (including borrowing some large gym fans from the rowers to put in the Long Room to keep us cool as it was an unexpectedly hot day). We really can’t thank you enough and now need to think of an excuse to host another party with you in the future!"
V212,London Rowing Club,"We got married in St. Mary's church and then had our reception in the London Rowing Club in February 2023. It far exceeded our expectations and was an incredible fabulous stress-free day with thanks to the wonderful Annabel making the day just run.

In the lead up to the event, Annabel was incredibly responsive, helpful and helped us plan the day exactly how we wanted it. She answered all our questions really quickly, always got back to us, was very flexible with what we could do and allowing us to personalise the space. Prior to the event, Annabel arranged for us to go and have a look around on a couple of additional occasions to help us plan how we would want it to look. She also gave our caterers a tour of the kitchens as they were new to the venue.

In the immediate lead up to the day, Annabel helped with our suppliers in getting chairs delivered and bringing all the wine over a day earlier. On the day, she helped to make the day flow and just dealt with things throughout the day.

The venue itself is beautiful with three rooms to use. A middle reception room, a cosy snug and the main long room. In the main long room, there is a rowing boat hanging upside down with fairly lights. The main lighting can be dimmed and gave a wonderful atmosphere for the evening meal. As our wedding was a winter wedding, it was fairly chilly so they lit fires in the main room and snug which added to the atmosphere.

We had around 90 guests - could have fitted a few more just about. We used the round tables, tablecloths, linen, plates cutlery and glasses provided and they were perfect for a wedding and looked very smart. No need to hire these. As mentioned, we did hire separate wedding chairs instead of the conference chairs provided. There's a lot of decoration in the way of rowing memorabilia on the walls which means you don't have to actually do too much to make it interesting for guests.

Overall, the perfect London wedding venue with absolutely fabulous views across the Thames with a long balcony to enjoy from. To top it off Annabel is truly amazing and so helpful."
V212,London Rowing Club,"We had our wedding (ceremony+reception) at LRC in July, and the venue itself and the team we worked with were absolutely incredible! Everything on the day went without a hitch and we heard so many compliments on the location - our guests loved the balcony and the layout inside, which included plenty of space for anyone wanting a break from dancing to sit down and relax. Would recommend to anyone looking to host an event!"
V212,London Rowing Club,"London Rowing Club is a truly fantastic venue and we were both so delighted with how our day went! The venue has real character with the classic rowing memorabilia and it’s location on the Thames, and looks amazing when it’s all set up. The layout and size of rooms I thought were perfect for our wedding of about 70 (+15ish more in the evenings) and of course the big attraction is the balcony which all of our guests adored!! (I wish I’d had more time during the day to stand out there and enjoy it 😂). Not only is it a fantastic venue in a great location but what really made this the most amazing venue was how great all of the staff, and all the recommend suppliers were! The day exceeded expectations and we got compliments on the place and the staff from all our guests. Couldn’t be happier with the venue, it was perfect for us!!"
V212,London Rowing Club,"We found the London Rowing Club while desperately combing through London locations after our original venue fell through a few months before the day.
Luckily for us it was available due to a cancellation - kismet!
From the start the charming Annabel put us very much at ease and helped us to envisage the day as we hoped it would be. She was very flexible and helpful throughout the planning process.
We were incredibly lucky with the weather on the day and the venue really came into its own - it was virtually impossible to get guests off the terrace, which is the perfect size for our smallish event (65 people) and of course offers gorgeous river views.
We were well looked after by the team and everything went off without a hitch. The interior of the space itself is lovely with a great sense of history.
Nice additional touch - table tennis was made available in the entry room for the later part of the evening!

It's a special place and I'd thoroughly recommend for anyone seeking a memorable spot to tie the knot!"
V212,London Rowing Club,"We got married at the London Rowing Club on a brilliantly sunny winter day on Saturday. All the way through in the run up (after 2 years or more of postponements), Annabel and team bent over backwards to help us arrange everything, recommended some brilliant suppliers for food (Shona Pollock comes highly recommended) and flowers (same with Steph the charityflorist.)

So many of our guests said how lovely the venue and staff were on the day, and the whole place looked a million dollars with an amazing photo set on and around the balcony and river - although we haven't seen those yet. The corkage and bar tariff prices are also incredibly reasonable for an inner London location!

I can't recommend the LRC highly enough. It will live in memory for a very long time."
V212,London Rowing Club,"The London Rowing Club team alongside the Dinner Ladies went above and beyond to ensure that we had the wedding perfectly fitting our requirements. Throughout the entire all of the suppliers worked seamlessly together to ensure the space transformed as we progressively added guests and transitioned between eating, our ceremony, more eating, music and dancing. We wouldn’t have had it any other way. The attention to detail of the team is second to none - perfect for any bride and groom seeking a beautiful event."
V213,The Prince Albert,"The team at The Prince Albert were always accommodating, made everything easy and stress-free, and helped us organise an amazing wedding party. They really knew what they were doing, and helped guide us through the process calmly, working around our schedule (which wasn't easy - we live abroad!) to make sure all our last-minute worries and concerns were sorted smoothly. The food was excellent, and the space was fantastic for our party. Can't recommend it highly enough!"
V213,The Prince Albert,"We had such a happy wedding with Harrison and this venue. Harrison was really flexible and answered any questions we had and made great suggestions when we needed seating arrangements, the schedule for the day, a florist, and more. The day was accessible to everyone and the food and drink were perfect. Thank you for making out wedding stress free and wonderful."
V213,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert was the most wonderful venue for our London wedding. We came across the venue at there wedding fair and chose alot of our suppliers from the same wedding fair.

Harrison and Lauren were always so on hand to help with any questions and did a fantastic job answering all of our questions. The staff were so friendly and helpful and made everything run like clockwork.

We couldn’t recommend The Prince Albert enough for a london wedding and would love to do it all again."
V213,The Prince Albert,"My wife and I were beyond happy with how everything went on our wedding day. Harrison, Diana, Claudio and the whole team were absolutely phenomenal! It was such a beautifully efficient operation, and we always felt like someone was there to help us when needed.

We've had dozens of compliments about the great food and how wonderfully intimate the venue was for a wedding. Some of our more traditional relatives said they were initially sceptical at the prospect of a pub wedding, but that it was one of the most beautiful and joyful weddings they’d been to. A friend of mine was also very happy that someone at the bar remembered her drink order throughout the evening! On top of that, everything ran perfectly to schedule, which is no doubt down to the high attention to detail.

It was very useful that the upstairs was free on Friday afternoon so that we could set up the space. It gave us plenty of time to do the flower arrangements, put up the bunting, and stick photos on the frame wall.

Thank you again so much for all the help and support you've given us - it really was the best day of our lives (so far)!"
V213,The Prince Albert,"My husband and I got married here in late September 2023, and I cannot recommend the Prince Albert enough!! Booking a wedding venue can be stressful and we felt like a lot of the venues we looked at gave us the ""hard sell"" but the folks at the Prince Albert helped to put us at ease every step of the way. We fell in love with how beautiful the pub was, so hired the upstairs for the ceremony, wedding breakfast and party afterwards for around 40 - 45 people. We were able to drop off decorations the night before and talk it all through with the staff, and they did such a good job of working with us and the florist to get the place looking amazing. The ceremony went off without a hitch, everybody loved the food and we had a blast in the evening. All the staff were amazing, but special shout out to Harrison and Lauren for helping us plan and run the day, and Maria for managing everything on the ground both when we dropped off the decorations and during the wedding itself. Thank you again for helping us celebrate our special day with our loved ones, for making it so stress free and so memorable!"
V213,The Prince Albert,"All you ever hear about wedding venues is that everything is a rip off, the food is meh, and there are a ton of annoying restrictions...the opposite is true of Harrison and The Prince Albert team. From Day 1, Harrison made the whole process not only easy but really fun! He was quick to respond, super knowledgeable, and very accommodating; he even helped our best man execute a surprise for us without it disrupting any timings. On the day, they decorated the place beautifully, managed to serve a 3 course dinner to 76 people unbelievably fast, and everyone raved about the food - to say they did a good job is a gross understatement, they went above and beyond. We were after ""classy fun"" and that's exactly what we got - thank you so so much!"
V213,The Prince Albert,"We had the exact wedding reception we wanted at the Prince Albert thanks to Harrison, Claudio and the other amazing staff who helped us feel so relaxed in the build up and during. We wanted a very low-key vibe and the team understood that but there were enough options for any style of wedding you wanted. The upstairs function room felt cozy and intimate while still leaving breathing room and space to dance, but you could easily rent the whole place if you wanted more guests and even choose to do your ceremony there. We had the most compliments on our food (we chose a buffet option). The team were particularly accomodating to some complicated dietary requirements and it was all delicious."
V213,The Prince Albert,"July 6, 2023 was the most memorable day of our lives! A big thank you to Harrison and the rest of the team for assisting us through out the whole process. Our guests loved the Prince Albert pub especially the sumptuous food and booze on our wedding day!

David & Dannah"
V213,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert is a Great venue for the classic Pub Wedding.
Harrison and the team did an amazing job to organize everything. The food was great and the service first class. Only sorry it was over so quickly. Thanks again for everything."
V213,The Prince Albert,"We found The Prince Albert when our original venue cancelled on us less than 2 months before our wedding. & we are so glad we did; everything happens for a reason! From the moment we met Harrison, we knew we were in safe hands, and the team at the Prince Albert made our day amazing. The pub looked beautiful and we were very greatful for the effort the team put in putting up all our decorations. We had so many compliments about the food, and we were very impressed in the swift and organised manner in whichever it was served. Everyone had a wonderful time, and we would not hesitate in recommending The Prince Albert."
V214,Kindred,"We chose Kindred for our 60 person wedding and it could not have been better. We wanted a venue where we could have the ceremony, dinner and dancing all under one roof, that was wheelchair accessible, and easy to get to on the tube, Kindred ticks all those boxes and more!
The food is incredible, we really enjoyed popping by to do all the tastings, we'll continue to come to the Cellar for food and cocktails. Many guests commented on how good the food was.
The place itself is gorgeous, inside and out. We used the whole venue, the main Hall for the ceremony, dinner and dancing, and the Library upstairs for the drinks reception and cake cutting. Also, being right next to Hammersmith station, the venue could not be easier to get to!
The staff are wonderfully attentive and helpful, both before and on the day. They were really open to the little details that made our day uniquely ours, from the drinks selections, to having a table and glasses on stage for the ceremony, to playing our music selections at the right time. Plus its a dog friendly venue!"
V214,Kindred,"We LOVE this venue! We got married here with only 12 weeks notice and Anna, the owner, and her staff went above and beyond to make the day as memorable, magical, and marvellous as we'd hoped it would be. The venue is elegant, stylish and perfect for a London, city based wedding. The food is sensational as it comes from their in-house kitchen on the ground floor and every guest remarked on how delicious their meal was. It's restaurant quality food, not your standard wedding food. The place looks stunning in all our wedding photos and the wedding cake they made us (at very short notice I might add!) was second to none. Everyone loved it. The venue was also perfect for late night dancing and drinking and merriment. It was such a pleasure - and a breeze - to work with Anna and her team on one of the most important days of my life, and I very much hope to do so again in the future. I will forever be grateful to her and all she helped us with."
V214,Kindred,"We had our wedding reception for 35 guests at Kindred, in the Library and Salon earlier this year. The day went incredibly smoothly, the staff couldn't have been more attentive and our guests raved about the food for weeks afterwards. It was the perfect sized space for our intimate celebration, really cosy and the atmosphere was great. The little touches really helped to make the day special, with espresso martinis served for the speeches and sparklers for our exit at the end of the night. Thanks again to the lovely Kindred team!"
V214,Kindred,"I cannot find a single fault in our experience with Kindred for our wedding. Not only was it a stunning venue that honestly made some of our guests gasp as they arrived, but Anna and the team were so incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. Having them support us really took so much of the wedding planning stress away and we knew we were in safe hands. I really appreciated that the team were happy to chat through ideas with me and were always keen to find creative solutions to give us the day that we had envisioned.

The food was absolutely delicious and they were so accommodating for our long list of dietary requirements from our guest. The cocktails were also so delicious. Our guests were buzzing for weeks after, as were we.

On the night, the staff were not only incredibly helpful and efficient, but also just so friendly, welcoming and complimentary. We felt thoroughly spoilt and very well looked after.

We visited so many venues and this was by far the best choice for us. The interiors made for some stunning photos and the layout of the spacing meant that whilst we had 80-100 guests, it still felt very intimate. I cannot recommend Kindred enough!"
V214,Kindred,"We would give a thousand stars if we could. Kindred hosted us for our cocktail style wedding and it was everything we could have hoped for and the perfect venue for this style of wedding. The wine, cocktails and food (incredible grazing board, canapés, bowls and pizzas) were exceptional and the team were on top of everything, friendly and nothing was ever an issue. We would HIGHLY recommend it. We have had loads of guests message us to tell us what a spectacular venue it was with the most friendly team. The venue had different spaces to suit our needs and the AV is amazing - it worked perfectly for our live music band and our DJ, and our own music playlists for our ceremony. They took the stress off planning and really did mean we could relax and not worry that everything would run smoothly. Thank you so much Kindred team for giving us the best day of our lives"
V215,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The best day of our lives and me and my now husband couldn't be more thankful to Bredenbury. Before booking Bredenbury we visited over 17 wedding venues in Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Herefordshire - we fell in love instantly, there is no need for a crazy amount of extra expense on decorations, the venue speaks for itself. The fact that it was no corkage just added to why we wanted to book and the team were so friendly. In the lead up to the wedding they were brilliant, we booked far in advance and brought over all our family members to come see the venue, they were so flexible, understanding and welcoming - they couldn't do enough for us. On the wedding day they had decorated for us by the time we had arrived and all we had to do on the day was to enjoy it - which was perfect. It really was the best day of our lives, all the comments from our family and friends was how beautiful the venue was. They kept the day running so smooth and we didn't need to think about a thing."
V215,Bredenbury Court Barns,"There truly aren't words to describe how incredible Bredenbury Court Barns and their entire team of fantastic staff were through the planning process and the day itself. They were so friendly, supportive and nothing was ever too much. From quick replies to any questions that popped to mind to planning meetings that left us feeling prepared and ready to the day being set up beyond perfectly. Our amazing wedding coordinator Lianna spent the days and months (years really!) leading up to our big day making sure everyone detail was perfect, that everything was incorporated that we'd dreamed of and made sure we didn't feel a moment of stress from start to finish. All throughout the building from the bridal booth, to the orangery to the oak barn was beautifully light and open - even with our wedding being the end of October - and we had so many compliments about this! There aren't enough words to say thank you and explain just how much we'd recommend this venue to everyone"
V215,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We had the perfect day back in July. The weather didn't go to plan but they helped make the day so special even with the last minute switches because of the rain. We had such an amazing day and the feedback from our guests about the venue, food and service was great! We cannot thank the team enough for the effort they put in throughout the whole process but especially on the day. We felt incredibly supported throughout the whole process."
V215,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The venue itself is stunning. The buildings, grounds and interior decorations are all beautiful and immaculately presented. From the moment you turn down the lane it is so picturesque, you know you've found somewhere special. It's exactly what we were imagining for our wedding venue.

The layout is perfect, with ample space for guests to mingle and move about, and great accessibility for older and disabled guests. Ours was a winter wedding, and while most of the day was inside it wasn't cramped and we could still enjoy the beautiful grounds through the expansive windows that run along the whole barn.

All of the venue is stunning, but practicality-wise the Bridal Suite warrants a special mention. Room length mirrors, plenty of room for the bridal party to get ready, have their makeup and hair done, and if there's time to relax as well. Drinks were served from 11 onwards, and it has it's own toilets and shower.

From our first meeting at Bredenbury the staff were exceptional. They gave a reassuring air of professionalism and experience, with just the right level of excitedness for our day without it feeling forced. We were really impressed by how responsive the whole team were, with speedy replies to any questions we had during the planning. This is something we particularly appreciated as we only gave ourselves 7 weeks to plan our big day.

Value for money wise it felt tricky to gauge when we were trying to choose a venue as the headline figure is rarely what you'll end up paying, with different venues charging different amounts for different things. Not the case with Bredenbury. With their No Corkage policy and generosity in being able to use whatever props they already have, any extras were non-essentials of our own choosing.

No Corkage is pretty significant. Some venues wanted to charge £20/bottle, so not having to pay this and being able to supply not only our own wine but beers, gin and soft drinks for the drinks reception and wedding breakfast was not only a massive saving but also made the occasion more personal for us. The bar staff and catering team were excellent, pouring and serving drinks, warming our mulled wine and setting up the gin bar. Once your guests have drunk you dry the venue's bar is well stocked and standard pub pricing.

We wanted a Christmas wedding and seeing in early November that they had a date available that December we couldn't resist. 7 weeks isn't long to organise a wedding with nearly 100 guests, and we couldn't have done it without the Bredenbury team being so organised. Our assigned event manager, Harriet, was brilliant in the runup and on the day, as were all the other managers and staff we spoke with. The Wedding Bible they fill out with you is a great idea and nails down all the finer details to ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible on the day.

We didn't want to have to spend the day before and morning of our wedding worrying about set up and decorations, but needn't have worried as Bredenbury did all of this for us. A meeting beforehand clarified what we wanted where; we simply dropped off boxes of stuff the day before and rocked up in the morning to find everything laid out as hoped.

This organisation extended to the third party suppliers, of which Bredenbury have an extensive list of local recommendations. We booked the ceiling lights with Cotswold Wedding Co. and didn't have to do anything else. The band, Apollo Gold (incredible!!) set up without any hassle and didn't have any issues with Bredenbury's noise limiter. Our florist Katrina Bevis hadn't been there before, but again had no problem getting everything in place on the morning.

On-site accommodation was good for close family and friends, but there's not enough for the majority of guests and the lack of a dedicated honeymoon suite is a bit of a shame. If you want privacy for your first night as a married couple it means taking over an entire lodge. The quality and comfort of the rooms is excellent, though, and the continental breakfast served the morning after in the East Lodge was delicious, with ample options for Vegan and Gluten Free.

Jenkinsons are the exclusive caterer for Bredenbury and have an extensive menu for nibbles, the wedding breakfast and dinner. The menu and ordering process is clear, and pricing is what we expected to pay. Food and service was as slick and faff-free as everything else. A real delight.

On the day, Harriet and the catering manager were absolute superstars. Zero stress, everything ran to time and as planned, and they were always available if we had any questions or needed help.

The whole day was perfect and exactly what we wanted. I don't think we could have achieved this without the exceptional organisation of Harriet and the team. The entire process was very slick, zero stress, and we wouldn't hesitate in recommending Bredenbury Court Barns to anyone looking to get married in a countryside paradise."
V215,Bredenbury Court Barns,"I want to say a massive thank you to Bredenbury Court Barns for hosting our wedding. From the start they were super amazing and accommodating to us. They won us over with their care and support even when we had a pickle in the beginning.

Olivia was super helpful from the start and throughout the year we were planning she offered huge amount of support and suggestions.

We typed in “orangery weddings” in google when we were first looking because I was keen to get a ceremony in an orangery and Bredenbury popped up after much searching. Once we saw the Orangery we cancelled every other viewing we had across the country because we felt we found the perfect place, and nothing compared to the reception with the beautiful windows that brought all the light in. The grounds were absolutely spectacular and gorgeous. It was a no brainer for us to pick such a beautiful venue. They brought my ideas to life and we were able to get support on anything from recommendation of suppliers, to ideas on decor to their favourite meals from Jenkinson’s. They fully outdid themselves in love for us. We can’t forget it.

Our wedding day was exceptional with Lianna helping us all the way. She was a breath of fresh air. She cared about all the little details and made us feel relaxed and had a good laugh with us. The fact she was there 100% of the way, before the wedding, during the wedding, and even after is unmatched! Thank you Lianna for really being there to make our wedding day smooth and relaxing.

The food was incredible too and we often think about how sad it is that we didn’t finish our second plates, we think about it a lot.

Thank you for the wonderful journey BCB, you blew us away with your integrity, kindness, and genuine support!"
V215,Bredenbury Court Barns,thank you to everyone at bredenbury court barns who made our day so special
V215,Bredenbury Court Barns,"From the moment we stepped foot into Bredenbury Court Barns, we knew this was the venue for us. It was the first and only venue we viewed as we were blown away by how gorgeous the venue is. The venue itself is absolutely stunning, with breathtaking views and impeccably maintained grounds that set the perfect backdrop for our special day.

The staff went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. From our first consultation to the last dance, their professionalism and attention to detail were exceptional. Harriet was absolutely brilliant and I don’t know what we would have done without her!

The food was another highlight—our guests are still talking about how delicious everything was! Jenkinsons are amazing, they helped us personalise our menu perfectly!

We couldn’t have asked for a more beautiful venue to have our wedding. The day couldn’t have been more perfect! Thank you to everyone at Bredenbury Court Barns for making our wedding day nothing short of magical!"
V215,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We could not have had a more perfect experience with Bredenbury Court Barns. Right from initial booking all the way through to breakfast the following morning, everything was perfect. Nothing was too much trouble for our wonderful planner, Lianna. She ensured the day ran smoothly and our months of planning turned out exactly as we’d imagined. They are available to answer any questions you have any time, they’re only an email away and get back to you so fast. The venue itself if just gorgeous, the grounds make for some wonderful photos, and the orangery lets so much light in that your ceremony photos are gorgeous. The whole place is fully air conditioned too which was great for our July wedding. The bridal suite is a perfect balance of being aesthetically pleasing and practical for getting ready in, it’s so spacious, lots of natural light, there’s plenty of plug sockets and huge mirrors so everyone has plenty of room for getting ready and no one is on top of eachother. There’s even an outside space for getting some fresh air. I’m so glad we chose to have our wedding here, it’s given us memories to cherish forever and there are zero memories of any stress!! Cannot recommend this venue enough!"
V215,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We cannot believe how lucky we fell to get married at such a beautiful venue. Right from the offset of viewing the venue, to our special day, we were taken of. No question was too silly, and so much pressure was taken off us during the planning. We managed to make everything our own and Lianna was there every step of the way. Thank you for giving us our happily ever after. We will forever be grateful."
V215,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We loved our wedding at Bredenbury the team did an amazing job providing everything we asked for and more. We especially liked that our wedding coordinator for the day, Harriet had thought of everything for us she went above and beyond and even offered to go and get my mum some more shoes when hers broke! absolute 5-star service and the food was amazing too!"

V217,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow what can I say, Brinsop is an absolutely stunning wedding venue with heaps of character and so many options of places for the ceremony and to do things. We fell in love with it as soon as we saw it and knew it was where we wanted to get married.

Right from the start, the Brinsop team were so helpful and accommodating. From giving an virtual tour then showing us around in person, Issy and the team were fantastic right the way through. Nothing was a hassle, no request too difficult and they were incredibly professional and responsive throughout the whole process.

We loved that Brinsop is an exclusive venue with accommodation on site so we could stay with the bridal party and our immediate family. All the rooms are unique and have so much character and it's fun exploring the whole place. You feel like you are in the middle of nowhere, in nature with swans, ducks and birds all around.

Throughout our planning process, Issy and the team helped us every step of the way, being incredibly flexible in managing our requests and really trying to create our vision. They even got their team to make a giant jenga that we could use on the day! They helped to create the most perfect bespoke wedding breakfast and canapes menu, and seemed so positive and excited to be part of our special day and experience.

Arriving at the venue, Issy and the team were ready and had everything prepared and ready to go. It made the process so smooth for us and meant we could really enjoy the day without any stress. Issy coordinated perfectly with all of our vendors and it really felt like she and the whole team were so happy for us and wanted to be part of our day which was amazing. Our guests commented on how friendly and responsive all the staff were and it really made the experience extra special.

I wouldn't change anything about the day and it was perfect. I would absolutely recommend Brinsop as a wedding venue and all the staff who are really invested in helping deliver your vision. Thank you so so much to the whole team for making this a day that we will look back on for many years to come with amazing memories."
V217,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Wow, what a perfect day we had! It really went without a hitch and that was thanks to Nina and all the staff at Brinsop. The team worked seamlessly to ensure the day was as perfect as could be, and it really was! The wedding was booked over 2 years in advance and the staff were so accommodating with all my questions, planning and site visits, they couldn’t do more to support us. Special thanks to our coordinator Nina who was a delight to work with and a credit to Brinsop. Everyone that attended agreed at how beautiful the venue and grounds were, it was a wedding people won’t forget! 10/10 would recommend to anyone!"
V217,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"It's taken me quite a while to get round to writing this review, because sadly it's quite a bittersweet one.

We were married last year on 15 June and Brinsop was our chosen venue for both our ceremony and reception. We were first attracted to brinsop by the accomodation, meaning our loved ones could stay on-site, especially my grandparents which was so important to me.

The home itself is absolutely beautiful, including ivy cottage which myself and my mum stayed in the night before the big day. It really was a picture perfect setting, and looking down from the bridal suite seeing the ceremony space being set up on the Wordsworth lawn was honestly magical. Id dreamed of an outdoor wedding on that lawn, and we were so grateful the weather cleared so we could have it. The team really did wait till the latest they could to ask us to make a call on an inside or outside wedding (despite being June, it was a gloomy day to start) which I really appreciated!

Another amazing part of hiring brinsop was the after hours space we were able to enjoy until 2am with our house guests. The games room was absolute fantastic and meant that if you wanted to go to bed you could, but you could also stay up, party and play pool. I really do think this was a highlight for our guests and would recommend massively if you can spare some budget.

On the night of the wedding, myself and my new husband actually stayed in one glamping tents which we absolutely loved. The groundsman was on site until we were ready to leave the games room, and he then took us up to our tent in one of the buggies, making sure we had plenty of blankets and even stopping off for some bottles of water for us. This was really special, and can't thank him enough.

Hugo Spritz!! Having hugos at both our welcome drinks and drinks reception after the ceremony was amazing. I'm not a fan of prosecco myself and Mark and the team made it possible for us to have Hugo's all round. We even sneaked some up to the bridal suite to have before the ceremony (thanks Nadia!). Our guests loved them, and the amount of people that have told me they now need them at their own wedding is crazy!

Onto the not so good - sadly it all started to go a little downhill when we moved things into the knot barn for our wedding breakfast. Sitting on the top table, I could see that guests at the top of the second rows of long tables didn't really even have a seat around the table and were just kind of plonked on. The seating plan hadn't been followed, and I don't think there were even enough tables laid for the service to be comfortable for people because there was a dance floor at the end of the barn (which I did not ask for).

It was quickly also brought to my attention, that one of our guests had had to put her child on her lap in order to remove the high chair so people had more space. We also lost about 5 napkins with them setting on fire from the candles because everything was just way too cramped.

I asked to speak to catering, and asked if there was anything that they could do. I was told 'well sure, if you want the whole thing to be late'. In truth I shouldn't have even had to broach this myself, as it should have been sorted by the coordination team.

The tables weren't changed, even after they'd said they'd sort after the first course and yet the whole meal still ran late. We've had so much feedback about people not having enough food, food not being easy to access on the sharing platters etc and honestly when you've waited so long for a day and had spent 25k on the venue and food alone, it really has been heartbreaking to hear. I do sometimes question why people still bring it up (even now, people talk about the dining) when it clearly upset me so much.

Whilst writing this review my husband asked my what we had for evening food - we didn't get any. It was left unannounced on a back table. I don't know what I was expecting, just not that.

The next morning, the houseguests were asked to come down to breakfast for 9am (it was on a note in the room) but as we were in the glamping area, we walked past the knot barn just before 8.30 and the food was already out. We ran down to the house to hurry everyone up, and by which time everyone arrived it had been sitting there for 20plus mins going cold.

My biggest upset was that when I fed all of the above back to brinsop, feeling pretty deflated about the catering, I was told they'd pass my feedback on and heard absolutely nothing back. 25k total with over 10k on food and drinks to hear absolutely nothing, and this was 9 months ago. I'm not saying this in would happen to anyone else, but really - it shouldn't have happened to us either."
V217,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our wedding! From start to finish, everything at Brinsop was flawless. The setting was absolutely stunning, creating the most magical backdrop for our special day. Our guests were blown away by the beautiful venue, the warm atmosphere, and the seamless coordination. Every detail was taken care of, and we felt so well looked after. The team was incredible, professional, friendly, and attentive. On the day itself, they ensured everything ran smoothly, allowing us to truly enjoy every moment. A special mention goes to our amazing wedding coordinator Nina!"
V217,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We had our wedding on New Year's Eve 2024 at Brinsop, and it was more perfect that we could have ever hoped for. The venue itself is stunning, with beautiful spacious rooms which slept over 40 of our guests. Our coordinator, Nina, was incredible and so supportive on the day - she kept everything running so smoothly and everything went by without a glitch. The food and drink managers Mark and Amy did the most incredible job - nothing was ever too much, they were so attentive, and the chefs the most stunning meal after we gave them a fairly vague brief of 'curry'! We had the most perfect day and we're so incredibly grateful to Brinsop and the team."
V217,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,Brinsop Court is pure magic—an unforgettable venue with an incredible team!
V217,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We were lucky enough to have our wedding at Brinsop Court in December, and it was an absolutely spectacular day. We fell in love with Brinsop as soon we set our eyes on the beautiful manor and surrounding gardens. Cate, Amy, Mark and the rest of the wonderful staff at Brinsop really go the extra mile to make you feel special, and are extremely flexible with requests in order to make your day feel more special. We honestly felt like there was no request too big leading up to the day and they really made us feel extremely comfortable leading up to the day.
On the day, Cate and her team were well on hand to help us with setting up everything and she had everything under control when there were a few hiccups. The day itself was absolutely magical, and that wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for everyone at Brinsop working extremely hard to ensure that everything went to plan and as smoothly as it could.
Thank you to everyone at Brinsop for making us feel at ease and ensuring that our wedding was an amazing day."
V217,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Brinsop, the perfect wedding venue! We got married at Brinsop in December and I can honestly say it was everything we could have hoped for and more. We found out about the venue through Hitched and was one of only two venues that we visited but as soon as we got the house we knew it was the one. We fell in love with everything about it and it was fair to say that our guests agreed with us with many saying it was the nicest venue they’d been to. We had the wonderful Nina as our coordinator and she was brilliant! Nothing was too much trouble and we had constant communication with her in the build up which helped our stress levels no end. The same can be said for all of the staff who were brilliant throughout and allowed us to have the best day of our lives with everything running seamlessly. A special mention must be given to Amy and the catering staff who put on such an incredible menu (including the tasting session that provided some of the best food we’d ever had) and ensured that the food has been one of the main things that people have mentioned to us since the wedding! We had our ceremony in the Banqueting Hall which provided the perfect setting, especially with it being a winter wedding, as it really added to the cosy atmosphere and the lounge areas/games room were perfect for the drink’s reception. We would have loved to have also had it in the courtyard, but the temperatures meant that the lounge with the fireplace was a far more appealing option on the day. We then had the wedding breakfast and reception in the knot barn which was decorated beautifully and was the perfect place for the party in the evening. Overall we really can’t thank everyone at Brinsop enough for making our day what it was, we can honestly say that we have been made to feel part of the family and already can’t wait to hopefully come back to stay in one of the cottages for our first anniversary!"
V217,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"Where do I start!!
Brinop Court is the most stunning venue, it was the first venue we visited and instantly fell in love! Theres so much history to the house and we were treated like family every time we visited before the wedding and it literally felt like home the whole weekend of the wedding, my guests also agreed!!

A special thank you to Issy our coodinator who went above and beyond ti make sure everything was perfect for us. It was so easy to plan and nothing was too much to ask, even arranging our dog to be our ring bearer!! When they say Brinsop is dog friendly they really mean it!!!

What a place, what a day!! Thank you so much everyone, you all made our day perfect and it really was the best day of our lives♥️"
V217,Brinsop Court Manor House and Barn,"We got married at the gorgeous Brinsop in October this year. It’s hard to put into words how amazing the whole experience was. We honestly had the best day of our lives!!!

We fell in love with Brinsop during our first visit back in December 2022. We knew almost immediately that Brinsop was the venue we were looking for! From the outside the venue looked like a painting - from the picturesque views of the countryside, to the swans swimming on the moat! The manor house itself has so much character, and has a lovely homely feel to it as you walk around it. Our guests were equally blown away by the venue!

A big thing for us was that it’s dog friendly, which meant we could have our two dogs join us on our special day, it wouldn’t have been the same without them there! They had so much fun walking around the grounds and greeting all of our guests!

Nina, our coordinator, and her team were always available to answer any of our questions in the run up to the day. This really put us at ease, knowing we were in safe hands. On the day, Nina and the team made sure everything ran smoothly and went above and beyond to ensure our guests were looked after. A shout out to Amy who heads up catering and Mark who manages the bar. The food and drinks were absolutely fantastic!

I highly recommend this venue! There’s a reason Brinsop is an award winning venue - and when you visit it’s not hard to see why. We are already looking forward to going back there for a date night next year! Thanks for everything Team Brinsop!

V218,The Manor at Bickley,"The Manor is the perfect venue for weddings! When our wedding venue fell through 4 months before the big day, I stumbled onto the Manor at Bickley and spoke to Craig. He was most helpful and kind and went above and beyond to make sure our wedding went ahead.

We hired the venue for our two day wedding and the staff were helpful and accommodating from start to finish. All of our guests were awed by the beautiful well kept grounds and the excellent service. We can’t thank the staff enough for making our wedding dreams a reality. They thought of every detail from bringing us champagne after our civil ceremony to making sure we had our card box at the end of the night! We are excited to head back to celebrate our anniversary there!"
V218,The Manor at Bickley,"Myself and my Husband chose this venue for our wedding last week and we can’t sing The Manor’s praises enough. From our very first enquiry, to the first viewing of the venue, right though until the big day, the staff at the manor have been nothing short of brilliant! Each staff member we came across was polite and accommodating. Special mention to Craig and Vicky with whom we did most of our liaising throughout the months leading up until our wedding. Craig and Vicky were super helpful, responsive and went above and beyond to make sure that we could have the day of our dreams. Even with last minute changes due to the weather, Craig who was just incredible throughout, managed to help us sort a backup plan so our day would still go ahead seamlessly.

The rooms at the manor were spacious and modern, giving us and our wedding party lots of space for photographers and videographers to capture the special moments on our wedding morning.

The lodge that was used for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready was fabulous. The manor was very flexible in giving us early access so we could get ready on time.

The grand marquee was definitely grand! Very spacious and when decorated looked like something out of a fairytale! lots of kitchen space, a huge bar and fantastic overhead speakers for the party!

The manor was super flexible to our needs regarding access, start times, outsourcing our vendors and much more. The venue is beautiful and spacious with options for outdoor and indoor events and entertainment. The grounds were absolutely beautiful, so many lovely spots for photos not only for us as the bride and groom but for guests too!

A very special thank you to our point of contact throughout, Craig. From our first meeting, he was charming, bubbly and made us feel super welcome. He reassured us that he has experience in African/Caribbean weddings and that our wedding day would amazing and it was. He was attentive and always let us know that he was only a phone call or e-mail away and was always quick to respond and answer any questions we had.

All in all, we had the most beautiful day at The manor and we would definitely recommend this venue for a wedding or other events.

V218,The Manor at Bickley,"We hired The Manor at Bickley for my daughters wedding. Got a brilliant service from the venue. Everything was set accordingly, as per floor plan. Our guests were loved the venue grounds/facilities and the overall wedding set up.

V219,Davenport House,We are so pleased we chose Davenport House for our wedding reception. Charley and the team were so helpful and thoughtful. Putting canapés behind the bar for us and making sure everything ran so smoothly. I am obsessed with the stunning house and grounds and it was absolutely perfect! Thank you so much for making our day so special!!
V219,Davenport House,"Davenport House is a STUNNING wedding venue so how could we not have it for our big day!?

The staff were exceptional! From the moment we booked through to our big day, we had an absolute blast and could not thank each member of staff enough! Special shout out to Jared (hopefully spelt right, haha!) who made sure we were fed, watered and ensured we took 5 minutes to ourselves every moment we could - Also even saved us slices of pie wedding cake before we went to bed!

Our guests have said they have never been to a wedding so spectacular, with the most amazing food and amazing staff so could not have been happier having Davenport as our venue! 🩷"
V219,Davenport House,"I just wanted to write to say a huge, enormous thank you to Charley and all the team at Davenport House. We still can’t believe how perfect our day was, and lots of our guests have told us it’s the best wedding they’ve ever been to. The team were all a huge part of making that happen. It was incredibly seamless and well planned on the day, meaning we genuinely didn’t have to think about a thing, except for enjoying ourselves. The day ran to schedule perfectly and even certain touches we didn’t know or expect to happen were planned by you and the team, which made the day even more special. Thank you so much for giving us our dream wedding day. We can’t wait to see the full set of pictures and the video now to relive it all!"
V219,Davenport House,"Without doubt the best day of our lives. From start to finish, Davenport has exceeded expectations. From the very first impression of the venue during the open day, the incredible food tasting evening, all the way through to the day itself, including the support and preparation leading up to it. It was really important to us to pick a venue that not only ticked the fairytale box, but also come with the complete support of a wedding planner, due to our busy jobs. We were lucky enough to have Charley as ours. She really took the time to listen and get to know us, to ensure the day was tailored to exactly what we wanted. We even had our own cocktail designed, which went down an absolute storm on the day! She considered every little detail, constantly putting our minds at ease, which made the whole process so easy and enjoyable. Honestly the day couldn’t have gone smoother, any anxiety or stress faded immediately as soon as we got to the venue. It was simply perfect. So many of our guests were complimentary of just how beautiful the venue is and just how well organised the day was, and that is the perfect way to summarise Davenport. Any prospective couples thinking of selecting Davenport as their venue, hesitate no further. It will be a day you never knew was possible! We cannot thank you enough Charley and the Davenport team, if only we could live the day over and over again"
V219,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was amazing. When looking for a venue we weren't just looking for something wow, we needed to have people who were enthused and passionate about their work - we found that at Davenport House.

From our first phone call & meeting with Lizzie and Tallulah, we knew this was the place for us. Having two brides wasn’t an issue; combining British, Asian and Spanish cultures - wasn't an issue; having brides enter together – wasn’t an issue. Nothing was an issue. At Davenport House, we got it all – a picturesque venue and the best team of staff anyone could ever wish for. All our external suppliers have commented what a fantastic venue you are. All out guests have said that the service and attention to detail was second to none. The thoughtful touches like hiring a Spanish speaking waiter for the table which spoke very little English ensured that everyone felt welcomed. Guests with dietary requirements didn't feel they got a second rate meal or they were an afterthought - the food for all throughout the day was exceptional. The rooms / cottages where our guests and we stayed, spotless and comfortable. The thought behind adding some cheese and Spanish ham to the morning breakfast - so sweet!

Special shout out to Megan - wedding planner extraordinaire who kept in touch throughout the planning process and was exceptional on the day. Ian who worked tirelessly to ensure the day ran smoothly and the food was perfect, Charley who was also in charge of one bride and ensuring that everything was on point. All the staff were fantastic - polite, professional and personal.

Everyone keeps saying that this was the best wedding they have ever attended and that’s a lot of weddings between people! When we asked why, they say things like ‘the venue’, ‘the staff’, but it all came back to the inclusivity, love & joy that they felt – and you were all a part of that.

Davenport House is a stunning venue made even better by those who work there. If you want the whole package on your wedding day, we strongly recommend you book them.

Thank you to the entire Davenport House team.

Sat and Ana xx"
V219,Davenport House,"Where to begin with our beautiful venue and thanking the people who made it all happen! We got married in November at Davenport House and it was easily the best day of our lives. We chose Davenport because we wanted to host our cosy winter wedding in a big grand house in the country, with all the grandeur and class but to still feel like an intimate celebration with our family and closest friends, and it was perfect in delivering just that. It is utterly beautiful, the location was perfect and exactly what we wanted. The food was absolutely AMAZING, we had so many compliments from our guests and we are so grateful for the team in delivering such a fabulous wedding breakfast. Thank you so much to Lizzie who couldn’t do more to help us have our dream day, and Ian who delivered the best service to us and our guests (the pizza at 2am was very much appreciated)

Massive massive thank you to Charley our wedding planner, who was so so helpful throughout our wedding planning process and on the day, I can’t thank her enough. She was always there whenever I needed her, helped me so much with creating our dream day and I will be forever grateful to her for keeping me sane! Whenever I had any worries I knew she was just a phone call away, which helped me a lot when planning a wedding!

Charley, Lizzie and Ian thank you for everything - best team ever. Our day was seamless and it was all down to you and your incredible team.

Jess and Sam xx"
V219,Davenport House,"Me and my (now) wife chose Davenport House as our wedding venue in mid 2022, to get married in September 2023, and it was the best decision we could have made. We looked at a range of Georgian style manor house type venues located in Cheshire, North Wales and the West Midlands areas. It blew all of the competition away in terms of the venue aesthetics, the balance in design (i.e. period characteristics vs modern design), the impressive condition of the property for its age plus what it offered for our wedding weekend.

Staff and service - In the UK, this is usually something that is average at best - if you're lucky. At Davenport House, the service from all staff was 10/10. I honestly don't think we've ever had better service for anything. We had a wedding planner from the start (Megan), who was an absolute saint and was fundamental in making the whole wedding a success. She was also instrumental in helping us find a way for our 'little' dog Bernie to be a part of the main event. Thanks Megan!

Accommodation - The fantastic condition, design and decor for Davenport House extends to all areas of the estate. The rooms are fantastic, very big, well maintained and cleaned religiously by the venue. We had no issues or problems from all of the guests who stayed onsite over the 3 days.

Food and drink - This got a lot of deserved praise from the guests too. We got to tailor our entire menu and it worked perfectly for what we wanted for the 3 days. The oyster bar and luxurious charcuterie board went down particularly well the day before the wedding.

I could keep writing much, much more on how fantastic this venue was for our wedding. But the best advice I could give for any interested couples is to go and visit it in person and reach out to Davenport House with any questions. Our own wedding ended up becoming both perfect and the best wedding we've ever been to. Thanks guys again!"
V219,Davenport House,"Fantastic location.
Great staff.
Beautiful place to get married.
I can wait to film here again soon thanks for having me."
V219,Davenport House,"Our wedding day was a fairytale, everything we could have dreamed of and more. Lizzie and Charley were fantastic in their support, organisation and professionalism in planning our wedding. The venue is simply spectacular- breathtaking. Our guests were blown away. The day ran so smoothly it was simply perfect. The food was out of this world our guests couldn't get enough. All the staff at the house went above and beyond to ensure we were happy and having a great day. The team were also extremely supportive of last minute changes/additions. The Davenport experience was truly wonderful and I'm sad to see it end right from our initial meetings, food tasting and finally our special day. Thank you: Lizzie, Charley, Ian and all of the team for a truly memorable day for us and our guests. Mr and Mrs Kissane"
V219,Davenport House,"We got married at Davenport House in February and they provided us with the most perfect day. Lizzie, Charley, Ian and the rest of the team were the best hosts we could have hoped for. Nothing was too much to ask and the guests all commented on the hospitality shown to them. The setting is utterly gorgeous, our weather was less than favourable so we did not make the most of the grounds but this didn't matter, the house was setting enough and so atmospheric! The food was utterly AMAZING and better than most restaurant food I have eaten. The venue feels intimate and grand at the same time.
I literally cannot recommend this place enough, they gave us the wedding we had always wanted and more!"

Every single detail was thought of and they run a really slick operation. This is essential as it meant I had a lot less to think about! They put me and my partner at ease throughout.

Hiring Pembroke Lodge was easy. We had a viewing where all information was shared in detail and super clear to understand and make a decision.
On the months leading up to the big day our contact was Alice. Alice is a star. Responsive, professional, and had answers and solutions to everything.
On the day, Nelson coordinated the whole thing, minute by minute, and we are forever grateful for his politeness, professionalism and high spirits. We felt safe and in good hands. I would give Pembroke Lodge way over 5 stars if I could :)"

Robert went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. He was always available to answer our questions, offer solutions, and provide creative suggestions that enhanced our vision. He coordinated effortlessly with our vendors, making sure everyone was on the same page, which took so much stress off our shoulders.

On the day of the wedding, he was a true rockstar! He made sure the timeline flowed perfectly, from setting up the ceremony space to ensuring the reception transitions were seamless. His dedication and hands-on approach allowed us to enjoy every moment without worrying about a single thing.

Our wedding was a dream come true, and we owe so much of that to him and the team! Thank you, for everything you all did to make our day magical."

Thank you so much, we really really appreciate all the help!"
V222,The Hackney,"If you are having a wedding for under 60 people then this is your place! From start to finish the communication and planning of the wedding was seamless and took so much of the stress out of the day. The totally customisable packages that they offer really does suit anyone’s budget and more importantly regardless of what package you end up going for it is value for money. The food was delicious and it catered to everyone’s tastes including a pregnant guest, halal, vegan and lactose intolerant and was the talking point for our guests. The venue itself is stunning! Lots of exposed brick, they had recently redecorated before our wedding and the reception room that doubled up as the dance floor was styled simply but made a statement and the outdoor covered patio area was a welcome addition. The team understood our vision from the get go and they completely nailed it, all of our guests couldn’t believe it was here! I honestly can’t recommend it enough if you’re wanting a small and intimate wedding venue but still with all the class. I would say to future couples even if you think this wouldn’t be your venue please please do have a proper look because it will change your mind, I had come across this venue multiple times over the course of a year and decided to take a leap of faith and give it a chance and we’re so happy we did."
V222,The Hackney,"We can’t recommend the Hackney highly enough. They made the whole process so easy and they offer so much in-house which we took advantage of. The food was especially great - our guests were amazed “best food I’ve ever had at a wedding” and the team took great care of us during the planning stages.

They offer a very customisable service with scalable pricing. If you’re having a fairly small wedding (under 60) then you must check out The Hackney.

We had such a perfect day and we owe so much of that to the fabulous venue. Beautiful space, so professionally run."
V222,The Hackney,"We had such a brilliant experience working with the team at The Hackney. We were regularly in touch throughout the planning process and the use of the shared spreadsheet was especially handy for keeping everyone informed.
We had to postpone our wedding two days before as we were both sick with COVID, and the team were just fantastic. They waited for us to recover and then we started to talk through options again. We were able to rebook just six months after our original date, and the team were accomodating and understanding throughout the process.
The day itself was perfect. Lots of our guests commented on the quality and quantity of the food and Hugo was great at keeping everything to time. We wish we could do it all again."
V222,The Hackney,"We had our wedding reception here and wow was it amazing. Hugo, Erika and the whole team were amazing. Every single guest commented on how delicious and plentiful the food was. The staff were amazing nothing was too much to ask and all so happy.
The venue itself was decorated amazingly, given we left our wedding stationary etc up to the venue it exceeded our expectations. I was concerned about the allowed decibel level for Dj / entertainment but it was plenty loud enough. I wish I could relive the day again, if you’re thinking about booking The Hackney do it! You will not regret!"
V222,The Hackney,"We held our wedding reception at The Hackney in July and it was truly the best experience. We opted for a standing reception for our 65 guests, serving food bowl-style for a more relaxed, less formal feel. The food was absolutely delicious and there was lots of it - it just kept coming! Our guests are still raving about how good the food was months later! Lots of good drinks options too - we especially like the cocktails here!

The staff on the night were so friendly, welcoming and were amazing with our children guests too!

The Hackney is such an aesthetic venue with exposed brick walls and existing foliage which we loved, so we kept additional decorations to a minimum. We dropped our decorations to The Hackney the day before and picked them up the day after, which was super easy! We hadn’t given them too much direction with where we wanted everything placed but when we turned up to the venue on the day it was truly perfect! The staff know exactly what they’re doing and had decorated it beautifully! The outdoor seating area is a great feature too (especially for our two greyhounds who chilled out there for the majority of the reception!)

We opted for a simple Spotify playlist for our music and their sound system was good.

The wedding planning process was super easy from start to finish, with continued support and check-ins from Hugo, from the moment we booked, to the day itself! We really enjoyed the menu tasting experience earlier in the year too, which is a great touch in the build up to the big day! The planning spreadsheet was easy to use and made us feel content and relaxed, knowing that everything was under control.

Overall, we would highly recommend The Hackney to anyone looking for an affordable, dog-friendly, wedding reception venue with a laidback vibe, delicious food and lovely friendly staff! We look forward to coming back every year to celebrate our anniversary, with an espresso martini!"
V222,The Hackney,"We hosted our wedding reception with the team at the hackney in May 2023. The planning experience was straight forward and easy to book. The availability for the venue is on the website so easy to see when they have and get it booked. We went with the 5 canapés, bowl food menu, and drinks on arrival with wine through the event. The staff were brilliant and food delicious.

We loved the vibe of the venue as we wanted a bit more of a casual event, with a relaxed feel and we were able to host our 85 guests with no issues (although limited to standing event at this size, there is enough scattered seating for anyone to sit when they wanted).

In terms of decorating, we didn't feel the need to add any extra flowers as the venue was already so made up with plants and other decorations.

We did add the photo box which I highly recommend, was great fun for our friends and family and came with a memory book. People were shy at first but really got into it. We also used the recommended baker who provided a delicious cake.

Final area to mention - pricing. Wedding venues can be really expensive and daunting before you even start paying for any food or drink. Something that really attracted us to this venue was the low spacing cost and the minimum spend with it. It meant that we were able to completely customise the experience and see where the money we were spending was going. There are many different options and packages to go with, so it's up to you.

Only thing that wasn't offered was any tasting of the food beforehand which we would've liked to have done but none the less, the food was delicious so it wasn't really needed!

To finish, we loved every moment of it and hope that many others get to experience the same. Thank you very much team at the hackney!"
V222,The Hackney,"We had our reception in July. The venue was cosy and comfortably fit 30 people without feeling too crowded or too empty (we were worried it might be too empty). We managed to fit a band in, arranged mini-golf in the venue after dinner, and customize the cocktail menu with custom recipe (that we provided before hand).

One of the biggest highlights was the food. The crispy roast pork got so many complements and indeed it was tasty. But really, all the dishes were amazing (we had a tasting session prior), it was hard to choose, but the taste of each dish was still top notch on the day itself too. I heard that the supper snacks we ordered were great too but alas, I was too busy and they were snapped up instantly!

Some other details:
* We were allowed to use the small room downstairs as a private space to put our stuff. Very handy to not mess up items.
* We went with a bar tab and kept increasing the budget each time till the end of the night instead of the all-you-can-drink. From our rough calculations, it worked out about the same going for all-you-can-drink. Of course, certain folk were heavy weights and more than made it up will be different for each crowd.
* Lighting for photos came out excellent (combination of photographer and venue lighting).
* You can adjust air conditioning to suit the weather (we had ours on the warm side due to older folk not dealing with cold too well).
* Outdoor space was a pleasant change in atmosphere for those who wanted some fresh air.

What about the review from the Bride? Bride approved this review."
V222,The Hackney,"The day was fabulous - Hugo was brilliant and flexible with what we were after. The tasting day before was such a great idea and the whole experience and guidance given made planning a wedding in c.5 months so much easier. We had vegans, last minute drop outs, ridiculously hot weather, about 3 different spotify playlists, a string quartet, florists arriving in the morning and a cake that arrived the day before - the team took it all in their stride and it seemed like a breeze. Loved it all and we've had such good feedback from guests. A fabulous whirlwind.

Two very minor points for feedback - we maxed out the guest numbers (the team did advise us against it but were very accommodating despite us also throwing musicians into the mix) and it was a little too crowded pre-lunch on such a hot day. We also put some speeches in between courses (again, we were recommended against it) and that may have been a slight mistake for the dessert timings, as the tasting day was 10/10. But, it was a perfect day in a stunning venue. Loved it - thank you guys."
V222,The Hackney,"Jon and the team were absolute superstars, hosting the perfect wedding day for us. The space is beautiful, the decor is modern and perfect. They were so accommodating for any request or question we had which we really appreciated. Guests commented on how great the cocktails were! The day ran so smoothly and we had a fantastic time."
V222,The Hackney,"From the initial phonecall to the warm welcome we got when we first visited The Hackney, we knew we were in safe hands and that we’d made the perfect choice. The venue offers the most beautiful interiors - the perfect mix of cosy, intimate and modern industrial - exactly what we were looking for!

Our entire experience with The Hackney was an absolute dream -we loved the mega organised approach to planning. Something that could have been incredibly intimidating was made so straightforward with the amazing support of Hugo the General Manager who embraced all our weird and wonderful suggestions and gave expert advice on what we could do to make things even better. We left every meeting buzzing with ideas and even more excited to welcome our closest friends and family to the big day.

The quality of the food and drinks is impeccable - every single one of our guests (even the fussiest!) has commented on how much they loved it. We absolutely loved the menu tasting, even though it made the decision even harder as everything was amazing. What makes it even better for us is living close by and being able to pop into our wedding venue for a coffee or a cocktail!

I couldn't recommend The Hackney enough - I just wish we could go back and do it all again!"
V223,PYRÁ,"We held our wedding reception at Pyra. We booked the entire venue, with the upstairs loft serving as a dance floor with bar and downstairs having tables and seating for guests.  Canapes were served upstairs and a buffet dinner was served downstairs.  We lucked out with great April weather, so guests were also able to enjoy Pyra’s patio and additional space on Lonsdale Road. We were very happy with our decision to have our reception at Pyra, and many of our guests commented on how lovely the space was, how nice the staff were, and how delicious the food was.
 
The venue:
The space is gorgeous with lots of natural light upstairs.  Guests arrived at 4pm but we had the venue for the entire day, and Pyra gave our florist access earlier to set up beautiful flower arrangements and candles - it looked stunning.  Pyra set up our welcome sign and card box too. The venue also accepted delivery of our cake on the morning of the wedding which was a huge help, set it up very nicely upstairs, and cut it for us after the formal “cake cutting” shots.  We were able to coordinate with Pyra ahead of time to arrange the space how we wanted, such as how many tables we wanted downstairs and the set-up of the loft upstairs.  They even had a microphone ready for us upstairs so we could say a few words to our guests before our cake cutting. Perfect! For the evening dancing, we were able to set the disco lighting to our colour scheme, which worked really well with candles and foliage (latter 2 provided by our florist).
 
The food:
The buffet dinner was fantastic.  Pyra gave us multiple menu items to choose from and we were able to fix a nice menu that took into account guests’ dietary restrictions.  We initially booked the venue when it had a different chef and menu.  We came in a few months before our wedding to try the new menu – our dinner was delicious then and there was no dip in quality for the buffet-style served at our reception. Fionn worked with us how to plan best - because we wanted a relaxed style with a dance floor upstairs, we ended up feeding our 80 guests in two sittings downstairs, which worked perfectly. The upstairs space can seat 60 people, which didn’t work for how we planned our event, but does look really nice in photos. The late night food served around 10pm also went down very well.
 
The staff:
The staff, including the bartenders and waiters, were hardworking, friendly and very nice to guests.  Enough staff were around that guests never had to wait long for drinks.  Members of staff cut our cake for us and also boxed up the late night food for guests to bring home.  Fionn, the day-of coordinator, was on-site for our entire reception and was very helpful, even helping coordinate our midnight bus arrival.
 
Responsiveness:
Overall we were happy with the responsiveness of the venue.  It took a little while to nail down the final details of the food menu and drinks menu/bar tab but we were ultimately very happy with the result.  As the venue hosts more weddings/ larger-scale events we’d expect this will improve.

Overall:
We highly recommend Pyra for a wedding reception. We had 80 guests in total, which worked very well for the canapes/cocktail hour upstairs (4-6pm), sit-down buffet downstairs (6-8pm, split into two seatings) and dancing upstairs (8pm-midnight).  The upstairs loft was able to fit all 80 guests plus a four-piece band.  Lonsdale Road is also a charming street that provided great photo opportunities.  We looked into several other venues, and came away happy with Pyra's quote – we were able to book the venue, food (including canapes, dinner and late night food) and a generous bar tab for roughly the amount some other London venues were charging for just their space (no food or drink included). We and our guests had a fantastic time. Thanks so much to Fionn and the Pyra team :)"
V223,PYRÁ,"We had our wedding celebration at Lula. We booked the loft and restaurant for this.

Positives:
The venue is beautiful and needs minimal decoration.
The food was amazing; the chef is truly professional and everyone loved it.
They redecorated the restaurant section and added a set of couches to make it a lounge, which was beautiful.
The staff was very hardworking, professional, and lovely.

They provided us with a lounge, a wedding breakfast space and a dance floor.

Flexibility with Cake:
The bakery was scheduled to deliver and set up the cake at 16:45, but they delivered it at 09:45 instead. The Lula team handled the situation professionally by storing the cake and setting it up at the correct time. They presented the cake beautifully and assisted in cutting it into nice pieces. It could not have been more perfect.


The list of available drinks was huge, and they were happy to make custom drinks and bring in different juices if requested in advance. The event manager tried to accommodate every wish we had, and on the day we could not have hoped for more. Most of our guests said it was one of the best weddings and most beautiful venues they had ever been to.

Negatives:
Food tasting for the wedding menu was not included, which we had assumed would be, but it was given at a 50% discount. We had to sort out the floral decoration last minute, as they had initially suggested they would arrange it for us after providing a budget, but later said we needed to find our own. At times, they were a bit slow to respond, which made us anxious, but after communicating with them, this was resolved, and communication was very swift.

In conclusion:
Lula gave us the most beautiful wedding we could have dreamt of. We highly recommend them. The venue, the food, the service were amazing, and we could not have hoped for more."
V224,Sandon Manor,"We had such a special wedding at Sandon Manor, the team made every effort to make our day so so special and we will be forever grateful for that. A dream team! The day ran so smoothly and they worked so hard. The venue is unique with lots of different spaces which unfold throughout the day, which was perfect as our wedding fell on a wet and windy autumnal day. We would highly recommend Sandon Manor!"
V224,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor provided the perfect venue for our wedding. From the initial conversations and meetings with the team, we knew we were in safe hands and had made the right choice. They kept us informed with any events, made information a bit payments clear and reassured us with any query we had.
The accommodation was exceptional and fitted our requirements perfectly, with high quality finishing touches throughout to ensure our stay was as comfortable as possible.
The wedding venue was incredible! Our ceremony took place in the gorgeously modern barn with stunning draping and greenery. Following on, we had a blissful drinks reception which was on the expertly manicured lawn (with mini golf!) and sun-trap of a courtyard. We then moved onto our wedding breakfast which was held in the main barn, seating all of our guests comfortably with space for decor and extra details. Following from dinner, the part started and the club room came to life! This was absolutely the talking point of the day and our guests raved about how incredible it was! It managed to create a club-like atmosphere, whilst maintaining the vibe, albeit at a reduced volume, in the rest of the barn. The layout of the venue was important to us, as it ensured our guests never strayed too far, to keep the momentum of the day.
The team at Sandon worked superbly with all of vendors which ensured the day ran smoothly from set up to clearing. All of our vendors commented on how much they too loved working there.
The venue, the aesthetics, the staff, everything was perfect! We would absolutely recommend to anyone getting married."
V224,Sandon Manor,"We cannot recommend Sandon Manor enough. From the quality of the service, the helpfulness and friendliness of the team, the beautiful accommodation and the most amazing venue which all or guests loved partying the night away in. To make it even more special the Manor is in amazing grounds in beautiful countryside and nature reserves.
Sandon Manor made our dream come true."
V224,Sandon Manor,"I couldn't recommend Sandon Manor highly enough - from our first enquiry to our Wedding, nothing was too much trouble. The team are so friendly and easy to communicate with, very approachable and responsive. They respond to any questions immediately and having the day before to set up with Tom was fantastic. Styaying in the Manor House and Dovecote was the icing on the cake as to be with friends and family the night before and the day after was so fabulous. On the day Tom and the team were absolutely fantastic and couldn't have done more to make our special day. We couldn't have dreamt of anywhere more perfect than Sandon Manor - a huge thank you to all the staff."
V224,Sandon Manor,"If you are considering Sandon Manor for your wedding venue, I beg you: scratch it off your list now. Yes, the house and grounds are beautiful, but the people behind it are absolutely awful. They ruined our wedding experience.

I will get straight to it. Sandon Manor has a very strict policy on guests leaving the site by 11:30pm (and no one is allowed back to the Manor unless they’re official guests staying overnight). We had lots of international guests at our wedding. Many hadn’t seen each other in years and would be jetlagged - we thought they may be keen to continue chatting after 11:30pm. With this in mind, we made a booking with Sandon Village Hall via our contacts at the church (where we were attending services and later married). They granted us access to the village hall until 1am as a contingency spill over space.

We mentioned this in passing during our online meeting with one of the Sandon Manor team a month before our wedding. Within hours, I received a voicemail from the lady in charge of Village Hall bookings saying (quote) “someone at Sandon Manor is trying to throw a spanner into the works for you”. It soon transpired that they had raised an official complaint to the parish council and pressurised the village hall team into cancelling our booking. To be clear, Sandon village Hall and Sandon Manor are entirely separate entities – there is no crossover between them whatsoever, as the owner of Sandon Manor later acknowledged.

It gets worse. Gob smacked, we asked Kate – the owner of Sandon Manor – for a call to find out what was going on. She was abhorrent, trying to justify her meddling as a necessary measure to protect her wedding license (side note: with Sandon Manor it is always about the money – once your deposit is paid they care nothing for your ‘special day’; you are just another cash cow). Did she apologise for stabbing us, her clients, in the back? No, she did not. She could not even fathom how hurt we were by being completely bypassed in the communication chain and how deceitful and disrespectful this was. My husband and I were quite literally left speechless. We’ve never experienced this sort of treatment from anyone, let alone our wedding venue - to whom we were paying many thousands of pounds. Dealing with this stress in the final month of wedding prep really took its toll on us and soured things. We no longer looked forward to our day, rather dreaded what Sandon Manor might do next.

Aside from this major incident, there were many other occasions when Sandon Manor were unhelpful and unfeeling in their interactions with us:

- We enquired if it would be possible to arrange a large pizza takeaway order instead of using Sandon Manor’s caterer for our late night food. One of the team explained on a call that this wasn’t contractually possible; we acknowledged this. We then received an email saying ‘If you are unable to follow this or any other of our T&C's we would be happy to cancel your booking.’ This was less than a month before our wedding.
- We had a harpist perform in the church. We were told she wasn’t allowed to play during our drinks reception in the grounds due to potential noise complaints (an acoustic harp at 2pm in the afternoon). No other music was permitted outside the house.
- Sandon Manor is an incredibly expensive (in hindsight, grossly overpriced) venue. But we were also hit with hidden fees when booking their accommodation option - an extra £425 ‘cleaning fee’ was added to our bill.
- At the time of booking, Sandon was running a promotion waivering the £700 fee for hiring their ceremony space. As we were marrying at the church, we asked if it would please be possible to put this towards other elements of our day i.e. using their festoon string of lights in the barn (for which they charge £450). They refused.
- We were unsure about booking the 1-bed Dovecote on the grounds as - at £499 for the weekend - it was a considerable expense. While we were deciding Sandon Manor rented it out on Air BnB (to one of our guests, which made for a very awkward conversation).

To summarise, you only get one wedding day. Kate and her team absolutely ruined ours. There are so many other lovely venues in north Hertfordshire run by decent, humane people. Please prioritise your happiness and choose wisely. I wish we had."
V224,Sandon Manor,"Sandon Manor is a stunning wedding venue with a great team behind it. The exclusive use of the manor for the weekend was a highlight, allowing us to relax with friends and family in the lead up to and after the big day. The Sandon team were brilliant, guiding us through the planning process and ensuring everything ran smoothly on the day. We couldn't have asked for a better place and team to help us celebrate our big day."
V224,Sandon Manor,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our special day. Holly, Tom and the rest of the brilliant team made us feel welcome from day one. Special mention to Tom for making the day run so seamlessly, so professional and accommodating of all our needs.

The venue itself is stunning, located in the beautiful Hertfordshire countryside. The Manor House makes for a tremendous location to prepare, and the Dovecote suite is a nice touch: a great addition for the groom to spend the last night. We loved the small details of the characteristic main venue, with the botanical feel to the bar a great backdrop to the barn.

It’s a shame we can’t stay every week!

Dan & Suzanne"
V224,Sandon Manor,"To Holly, Louise, Tom & Kate, wow, what can we say but the biggest thank you for the best day of our lives! When we viewed the beautiful venue over two years ago we just knew instantly Sandon Manor was the one, not just because it’s stunning, but you guys are amazing! Thank you for making all our wedding dreams come true. Forever grateful and can’t wait to return to reminisce. Lots of love, the new Mr & Mrs Jakes xxx"
V224,Sandon Manor,"From the moment we visited Sandon Manor we knew this would be our wedding venue for 9 September 2023. Seeing the spectacular finish of the house carry through to the completed venue just shows the high level of attention to detail this venue had to offer.

Holly, Tom and the rest of the team filled us with confidence right from our first interactions, annd went above and beyond on the wedding weekend itself to facilitate us, our suppliers and guests. The main house, dovecote, annex and extensive grounds were a wonderful way to have close family stay with us on site, and so handy to be able to all get ready nearby the morning of.

Thank you for making our wedding weekend a truly memorable occasion, for us and our families. We all look back on this day with the happiest, sunniest memories and Sandon Manor will always have a very special place in our hearts."
V224,Sandon Manor,"We had the most amazing wedding weekend at Sandon Manor.

The venue itself is the perfect backdrop for a wedding, our photos looked amazing from every single angle. There were so many spaces to make use of throughout the day which helped things to run incredibly smoothly and meant we didn’t need to have a ‘turnaround’ during the evening. The spaces really wowed our guests and created such a lovely atmosphere. Including the ‘club room’ dance floor that had our guests dancing until the very last song!

We stayed at the Manor House for the weekend, extending our wedding into a perfect weekend retreat. The house itself is beautiful, with lots of different areas for everyone to relax, and the perfect peaceful location to chill the night before the big day!

From our first viewing to checking out the day after our wedding, the Sandon staff were attentive, friendly and helped us feel relaxed and looked after throughout an otherwise overwhelming process. We’d highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for a beautiful, peaceful and unique wedding venue!"
V225,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Thank you so much to the entire team for making our wedding so special! Thanks to Donique, MJ, Mo, Harry and everyone else for helping us organise our day and for their professional but friendly attitude. Merchant Taylors is such a beautiful venue and offers a brilliant layout and different spaces to make the day so special!"
V225,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you all so very much for such an amazing wedding on Saturday. You all worked tirelessly to make it so special. Everything was truly wonderful and you all did me proud! Both Hugh and I couldn’t have asked for anything more in terms of being so well looked after. Our guests were so impressed and have given us so many compliments on a brilliantly well run event. Thank you all again for playing a brilliant part in our truly wonderful day of which we loved every minute
V225,Merchant Taylor's Hall,Thank you so much for the most wonderful wedding reception at the end of April. We had the perfect day and our guests all commented on how well looked after they has been. Thank you again for all your hard work!
V225,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"We know this is very late (we have no excuse), but we wanted to say thank you for everything you and the team at Merchant Taylor's did for us on our wedding day. All the guests have since told us how much they loved the venue, food and service. Fingers crossed you get a few couples getting in touch! Again, Thank You for everything!"
V225,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"My brother and I attended the wedding today, as Florist's for the wedding party.
We were treated fantastically well by ALL the staff that we met, nothing was too much trouble and they made our task a COMPLETE pleasure.
If this is how they treat the actual wedding party then you will have a unforgettable time. Many thanks to all the staff for helping us to do our job with ease ."
V225,Merchant Taylor's Hall,"Zara,

Can we thank you and your team at Merchant Taylor’s Hall for all your hard work in making Caroline and Neil’s recent wedding so very special. You, in particular, were able to deal with every question and request in a really professional manner.

Merchant Taylors’ Hall is part of the rich panoply of history and tradition, which makes this great City. All of our guests, and in particular those from abroad, were totally spell bound by the atmosphere, the food and service.

James was superb in organising the whole operation. To turn the Great Hall from a wedding ceremony hall to a banqueting suite for 110 guests, including flowers, place settings and dance floor in ninety minutes was truly remarkable.

The food and wine was of an amazing standard, we know that Merchant Taylors’ Hall has a reputation for presenting some of the finest dining in the City of London. You certainly surpassed all expectations.

We have many wonderful memories of the 10th September 2016, but it is best summed up by our daughter Caroline, “Can we do it all over again?”."
V226,Garden Museum,I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate everything that you did to make our party such a success last Friday. It was brilliant being outside on such a lovely everning. Everyone was very impressed with the venue.
V226,Garden Museum,"Thank you for all your help, advice and on-the-day support, it really made our wedding very special and it certianly went off without a hitch! The Museum looked amazing and the garden was perfect, especially as the sunshine adn the guests wanted to make the most of the beautiful surroundings."
V227,Clearwell Castle,"Can’t tell you how wonderful the team were at Clearwell. Our wedding coordinator Phaedra was exceptional. Attention to detail and everyone of the team from front of house, waiting staff, groundsmen and the DJ made our day absolutely everything we dreamed of and unique to us.

Can’t recommend highly enough and cost was outstanding value for money.

So many our guest commented on the quality of the food and that it was the best wedding they had been too! The children loved the magic of the castle and opportunity to get outside and see the grounds.

The grooms family had a fabulous time staying in the cottages the night before and our guests at both the Castle & the Wyndham had a fabulous stay on the night of the wedding.

Wish we could do it all again!"
V227,Clearwell Castle,We had our wedding at Clearwell in June and we couldn’t recommend it highly enough. From start to finish everything was perfect and they went above and beyond to ensure we had an amazing day. I’d not hesitate in recommending them to any couples. Just a gorgeous place with staff that really care in making your day all that you hope it will be.
V227,Clearwell Castle,"From the moment we first visited Clearwell, we knew this was the venue for us. From the moment we started planning to the final touches on the day, all the staff were fantastic. Ann, our wedding coordinator, was a delight to work with throughout. Nothing was too much trouble and she kept us updated throughout. The day was tailored exactly to our needs and when we arrived at the venue on the day they had prepared everything perfectly.

We did the night before package which included rooms and food the evening before. We were supplied with so much food no one went hungry. The rooms in the Wyndham and the Castle are fantastically appointed.

The venue itself is gorgeous. The cellar bar downstairs adds a whole different dimension to the occasion where you can really let your hair down.

This was an absolute dream come true venue for us. We loved every single minute."
V227,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot fault this venue at all. We initially had to change our wedding date because of lockdown and they were so supportive and empathetic.
Ann, our coordinator, is quite possibly the loveliest person on the planet. She was always happy to answer any questions and it never felt like we were being a nuisances or asking a silly question.
On the morning of the wedding she was a lovely calm presence and the whole day just ran like clockwork.
The food was out of this world with many guests saying it was the best food they’d had at a wedding and one person actually thought we’d hired a Michellin Chef!
The venue is so so beautiful with plenty of space. The downstairs cellar was a great place to party the night away, it was like an exclusive nightclub. There were lots of quieter rooms for people who wanted some peace.
The DJ was brilliant, we forgot to give a list of songs we liked but he did a great job of guessing what we liked ( he must’ve looked at our age and figured nineties dance music was our era. And he was bang on the money)
I do not have a single complaint about this venue"
V227,Clearwell Castle,"I cannot speak highly enough about Clearwell Castle as a wedding venue. The venue itself is absolutely stunning. It rained on our wedding day but the indoor space was so vast and beautiful that ourselves and our guests still had the most amazing time! Our wedding co-ordinator, Phaedra, was absolutely incredible, both before and during the wedding. She was always so professional, replied to all of my emails (there were many) and answered all queries efficiently. On the day, we genuinely could not have managed without her. The day flowed so well with her guidance and it really helped me as the Bride as I felt I didn't need to worry about anything! All the other staff at Clearwell and at the Wyndham hotel were also so wonderful! Everyone worked so hard and every member of staff was so kind to us; it just made our day incredibly special and we are so appreciative to them all. The food was great, service very quick and all the guests really enjoyed it! We had so many compliments about the staff and venue! I honestly could not recommend Clearwell castle more as a wedding venue!"
V227,Clearwell Castle,"Our wedding on 10/11/23 was just the absolute perfect day from start to finish. Our wedding planner manager, Hannah, was incredible, not just on the day but throughout the whole planning process. She ensured everything ran smoothly on the day, sparing no details ensuring everything was just perfect and to time but without being stressful. She was very accommodating with the planning meetings working around both mine and my now Husband's shift patterns.
We both stayed the night before our wedding and the night of the wedding with many of our guests travelling a distance so also staying in the Wyndham which was very convenient. Staying in Keepers cottage with the Bridesmaids the night before added to the experience with the added feature of the hot tub, the groomsmen were very jealous. The beds were very comfortable and everyone was excited to stay in a castle.
On the day of the wedding, the staff were very accommodating moving the bridal party along to the bridal suite to finish preparations earlier than originally planned. The breakfast provided was the perfect amount for a busy morning getting ready. Everything, including the gardens, were immaculately kept adding to the WOW factor of getting married in a Castle.
The canapes served and welcome drinks were well received by the guests and ourselves whilst we had photographers prior to the wedding breakfast. The food was phenomenal and great portions and I was stuffed after. The staff were very accommodating for us with a lot of people with allergies, dislikes of mushrooms so adapting the menu for these individual people. We were even able to swap out a few bottles of wine included in our package for cocktails as us as the Bride and Groom did not drink wine.
As soon as we walked in the venue the first time, we knew it was the place we wanted to get married. Everytime we went back to view the venue again I fell more and more in love. For anyone thinking about viewing or even booking this incredible venue I would say do it! We will be going back for events in the future to relive the best day of our lives."
V227,Clearwell Castle,"We got married at Clearwell castle April 2023. What can I say it's the most perfect venue and we had the most amazing day. The organisation was amazing and the staff were great on the day and even leading up to the big day. Phaedra was our wedding planner and communication with her was great throughout and on our wedding day she ensured that it all ran smoothly. I cannot recommend Clearwell castle and their staff enough. Thank you again for helping us have our dream wedding.
Kind regards

Vanessa & David x"
V227,Clearwell Castle,"We had the most amazing wedding day on the 24th of November 2023, the whole day ran so smoothly and all our guests absolutely loved the venue. The food was amazing and our guests loved the fish and chip buffet in the evening! The whole progress of planning the wedding was so straight forward and Phedera was a great wedding manager."
V227,Clearwell Castle,"Clearwell Castle exceeded all our expectations for our wedding day. The moment we stepped onto the grounds, we were captivated by its timeless charm. The staff, especially Hannah, went above and beyond to make every detail perfect, ensuring a seamless and stress-free experience. The Ball Room, where we exchanged our vows, felt like something out of a storybook. The surrounding gardens provided a stunning backdrop for photos and added to the overall enchantment of the day. Our guests were equally impressed, and many commented on the unique and romantic atmosphere. Choosing Clearwell Castle was the best decision we made for our special day; it truly felt like a fairy-tale come to life."
V227,Clearwell Castle,"We had the perfect wedding at Clearwell Castle, their team were superb in providing planning assistance from the point of our booking, guidance on all aspects of our wedding choices from registrars and suppliers, and coordination on the day of the wedding to make sure it flowed seamlessly. It was a beautiful day, and we couldn't be happier with our choice of Wedding location."
V228,Inner Temple,We got married here in 2023. Everything was perfect and the team made sure the day/food etc was just as we wanted it. Particular thanks to Priya and Eva (Pegasus) for their hard work making our wedding day and lead up so special.
V229,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"I got married at Dodford Manor in February this year. A great time was had by all and I will be recommending the venue to any friends planning weddings.

The weather was bad on the day so we didn’t get to use the outside area very much, but it didn’t matter as the inside is so lovely.

Sky was really helpful and put me at ease on the day. Questions in the lead up and on the day were answered quickly and I was made to feel like the only bride in the world!"
V229,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford was the first venue we looked at shortly after we got engaged. The staff were friendly and relaxed when we had a tour, I knew it was the place for us! I think Lydia telling my now husband that we couldn’t have fireworks due to the animals nearby but we could have a fire performer outside, sold the deal for us! I got an amazing fire performer as a surprise for my husband and the guests after we had sparklers, and it just completed an amazing day!
We heard such positive things Dodford about how professional and smooth running weddings have been from our suppliers, and you guys didn’t disappoint. You handled the day so well, we didn’t worry about a thing and just enjoyed ourselves the whole day.
We honestly had so many lovely messages and conversations after our wedding about how the venue was amazing, everything and everyone was catered for, from my 88 year old Nan, to young children who could play and enjoy the outdoors with a scoop of amazing ice cream. We honestly couldn’t have asked for a better day, we would do it again in a heartbeat if we could! Thank you for making the day so seamless! We are eternally grateful to everyone at Dodford for making our dreams come true becoming Mr and Mrs Price!"
V229,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"Dodford Manor what an incredible venue, from initial enquiry to booking, Dodford and the staff were so accommodating and well organised. Nothing was ever too much trouble, even if emails were being sent at 11pm. The day itself, wow it was absolutely incredible, as our wedding was on a budget and due to small numbers Dodford were amazing at setting out our decorations, everything was absolutely perfect and a special shout out to Kayleigh who was amazing on our wedding day. She kept us on time, always checking we were okay and just such a lovely person and really made our day perfect. Would highly recommend a Dodford to any couple due to be married they make the planning and the day an absolute dream and we want to relive it over again."
V229,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"It goes without saying that Dodford is a fab venue.... stunning set up, well maintained, clean, perfect grounds etc... but the best thing about Dodford is the team! I had super high expectations of any wedding venue I booked as I used to run a wedding venue myself (potential nightmare client 😂).... from the 1st viewing the team were fantastic. Relaxed, stress free, organised, professional, knowledgeable, flexible but mostly importantly friendly which gave me complete confidence in them delivering my perfect day.
In the run up to the big day the team are super responsive on email and phone We didn't meet our Event Manager, Lydia, until the day but I was always confident that they work as a whole team and therefore having 1 point of contact was not necessary at all.
In the day Lydia was amazing! Still relaxed and professional and the whole day ran so smoothly. Every requirement was perfect, on time, delivered exceptionally.
We had the best day, thank you to the whole team (especially Lydia!)

V229,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We honestly can’t say thank you enough for how amazing Dodford Manor Barn was, along with all the incredible staff who helped make our day truly unforgettable.

From the moment we visited, we fell in love with the beautiful landscapes, open-plan barns, and stunning large windows that flooded the space with natural light. The venue package was one of the best we saw during our search—it felt like everything we could possibly need was covered.

The team at Dodford Manor Barn were incredibly friendly and supportive throughout the entire planning process. Communication was open and consistent, which made everything feel so much more manageable and stress-free. We were even able to find all of our wonderful vendors through Dodford Manor Barn, which was a huge bonus!

As a bride who suffers from anxiety, I was unwell on the morning of the wedding. But I have to give special thanks to Kayleigh and our vendors, who were absolutely amazing and supported me through every step—they helped me feel calm, cared for, and ready to enjoy the day.

Our guests couldn’t stop talking about how stunning the venue was and how lovely the food turned out. We were also lucky enough to have sunshine all day, topped off with a beautiful sunset in the evening—it truly felt magical.

Thank you again, Dodford Manor Barn, for being such a perfect place to start our next chapter.

With love,
Carter & Emmie (24.03.2025) x"
V229,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"From the moment we booked our wedding at Dodford Manor, we knew we were in good hands—but nothing could have prepared us for just how extraordinary the experience would be. Every single detail was handled with such precision, care, and genuine warmth that it truly felt like a dream come to life.

The venue itself is breathtaking, but what made our day unforgettable was the impeccable service. The entire team operated like a well-oiled machine, making sure everything ran smoothly while keeping the atmosphere joyful and stress-free. Their attention to detail was second to none—no request was too big or too small.

We want to give a heartfelt, special shoutout to *Lydia*, our incredible Wedding Manager. From our first meeting to the final dance, she was nothing short of amazing. Lydia went above and beyond at every turn—anticipating needs before we even voiced them, coordinating flawlessly with suppliers, and offering support with a calming confidence that put us completely at ease, (apart from making me cry the second I saw her! 😂). Her passion for what she does shone through in every interaction, and our day would not have been the same without her.

Thanks to this amazing venue and its phenomenal team (especially Lydia!), we were able to truly enjoy every moment of our wedding, knowing everything was in the best possible hands. If you're considering this venue for your big day—don’t hesitate. It’s everything you hope for, and more.

We want to do it over and over!
A day we will NEVER forget!!

Thank you again and all our Love,
Mr & Mr Pargeter-Prince
Rowan & Karl xx"
V229,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We booked Dodford Manor in Feb 2024 after we viewed the space, for our wedding in March 2025. It was the only venue we viewed, but instantly fell in love with the character and variety of spaces the venue had to offer. The free corkage also really appealed to us as a great way for us to bring our own drinks at a good cost.

From start to end, the team were amazing, helping us with the planning of the day and making sure we had a great array of suppliers we could work with. The live band was a huge part of our day, and Dodford have a great mixture of acts on their supplier list.

On the day of the wedding, the groomsmen arrived at the venue to help with set up to see that our amazing event manager, Kayleigh had every single aspect of the day in hand and sorted. She sorted all table settings, decor, stationary - Everything!! Nothing was too much to ask of her and the Dodford team. The day ran impeccably well, with everything being on time and everything we asked for being sorted. Our drinks were served chilled, on time and were always around. It’s easy for venues who offer free corkage to try and limit you drinking your own drink - Not here!! There was constantly beers being topped up, wine bottles replaced and aperol spritz being taken round. Cannot fault them!

The team packed all of our bits away and ready for us to collect the next morning. We are very aware Dodford is a busy venue and wanted to make sure we wasn’t just “another wedding” but at no point was that the case. We felt like we were the one and only wedding and genuinely could not ask for more!

Thank you so so much for everything, Highly recommended!!"
V229,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We got married her a month ago today and had the most amazing day with them. Jess, Jack and the team made sure that everything ran smoothly and that they were doing everything they could for us on the day. We would 100% recommend them for anyone wishing to marry in such a beautiful setting."
V229,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,"We had been apprehensive booking Dodford for our reception that it was so popular in Northamptonshire that our wedding could end up looking the same as a lot of others we knew of, as we're local - but that was a ridiculous thing to worry about! The level of flexibility/customisation you get with Dodford is unmatched in our opinion; as it's such a beautiful venue to start with, you don't have to work hard to make it look good before adding in your personality as a couple!

The whole process from enquiries to final planning and the execution on the day were great. We did have a slight issue with them not inviting us to a food tasting in enough time before our wedding date (whether they forgot/we were missed off a list we don't know) but when we did raise it they invited us to a tasting at their sister venue instead (it's 2 hours away but we were available to travel thankfully). Every member of staff we encountered in our experience with Dodford were so friendly and make you feel like you are the only couple that matters for them in that moment, which we really appreciated from such a popular/busy venue. Abbie was our Event Manager on the day and provided such an elevated level of service, nothing was too much trouble and she executed our plans/vision to a tee, adding in some extra details that we loved too.

Our wedding was in December 2024, and we only had our reception at Dodford, so the ceremony barn was set up for our drinks reception with plenty of space for guests without it feeling cramped or equally like we were all rattling around in there (we had 75 guests for our reception). They don't have many photos of indoor drinks receptions in their promo so I was a little worried how it would look but the team had it set up beautifully. We also had a brass band on the mezzanine level which was really fun and festive!

What sold Dodford for us was the no daytime corkage, which meant we could really personalise our drinks reception and wedding breakfast drinks without breaking the bank. There was a slight disconnect with how and when we had requested/planned to serve some of the drinks in our planning meeting and what happened on the day, which we think may have been a slight hiccup in communication between Dodford and Jenkinsons (the caterers), but it didn't have a negative impact on our day at all!

Overall, there's a reason this is such a popular venue - it is truly perfect!"
V229,Dodford Manor - Barn Wedding Venue,Dodford manor is an amazing wedding venue. From the very beginning when we first stepped into the venue to look around we fell in love. We knew we had to have our wedding there. After booking the venue we had amazing contact with the staff from booking our food tasting session. To a general email to see how our wedding planning was going. The planning meeting was well organised and we were able to talk through exactly what we wanted and no want was too big for the team.
V230,Gosfield Hall,"I never imagined my wedding would be somewhere as stunning as Gosfield hall but from the minute we saw this venue we knew it was the one for us and didn't bother viewing anymore venues as we had already made our minds up about having our wedding here! We were absolutely blown away with the natural beauty of Gosfield hall and so booked two years in advance of our wedding day! The professionalism and advice we received from Linda was super helpful and informative on the run up to our wedding as there is soo much to think about! We loved that we could have our day and evening all in one place aswell as the option weather permitting to have our wedding ceremony outside. I'm pleased to say the weather was absolutely perfect on our wedding day and we got to have our fairytale wedding outside! The package we paid for was well worth the money! Our guests were absolutely spoilt on our day and have all said it was the best wedding they've ever been too! It was amazing to have our guests stay over aswell! Jocie our wedding planner was absolutely amazing! She was sooo friendly and super accommodating and went above and beyond on our day to make it absolutely perfect with no hiccups! She even helped dress me on the day as she knew how to do up a corset dress and my mother didn't have a clue lol she made all my wedding details and decorations come to life and done such a stunning job decorating our dream venue aswell as being super supportive towards me my family and guests! The honeymoon suite is the best we've ever seen and completely took ours and our guests breaths away! Mind blowing! The food,venue,grounds,accomodation and night before accomodation were absolutely stunning and we want to thank everyone at Gosfield hall for making our day soo incredible and special and a day we and our guests will never forget! We can't wait to return to Gosfield! Thank you everyone at Gosfield what an amazing place!"
V230,Gosfield Hall,"We had previously experienced Gosfield Hall as a guest before deciding on it for our anniversary.

Our day was beautiful and went according to plan. Our guests all had great feedback about the day.

The only thing we would have changed would have been more diverse menu for the main meals."
V230,Gosfield Hall,"Gosfield hall is a beautiful location for a wedding and their packages cover all the important stuff! We didn’t have to worry about caterers, wedding coordinator or a DJ - all included! Great service, lovely food and everyone really enjoyed the day! Our coordinator Jocie was fab on the day, getting everything organised and fetching anything we needed. Couldn’t have asked for better, she knew the time line and the day flowed really smoothly!"
V230,Gosfield Hall,"We got married at Gosfield Hall and everything about it was perfect from when we arrive to view it, booking, the communication and Faye Carter our wedding Coordinator! If you want the best wedding day with no hassle, Gosfield is your place!!"
V230,Gosfield Hall,"Myself and my Wife have just got married at Gosfield Hall,
Our expensive started when we viewed the venue and we first met Linda sales manager, she welcome us in & made us feel at home, we wasn’t sure how, but she made us feel calm like this was where we was meant to be.
Once we looked around at all the venue has to offer we had already made a decision as this is such a stunning location and instantly new this was what we wanted! It was just right for us.

We did not get made to feel pressured to make any decisions immediately however we did end up booking our big say within the next few days after our visit.

Our next contact was with Ellie our wedding planner, she was very helpful and nothing was ever to much, we enjoyed the food tasting at the venue and was very impressed with the experience, it was out of this world.
Ellie helped us through all of our problems and made sure all of our plans come to life.

Now on our big day, what can I say? The staff were amazing, Ellie couldn’t have done enough every time you wanted to ask a question she was next to us any time we needed something. She was there all the way through the day/ night & even the next morning, Ellie made our day Run seamlessly.
We’ve been to many weddings before but never have we had food as amazing as we did here.
Every guest was amazed at the food quality and commented on how delicious it was!
Just to sum up if you’re thinking about booking your wedding at Gosfield Hall don’t question it just book it. You will be amazed."
V230,Gosfield Hall,"The venue is stunning and was the perfect setting for our winter wedding (so much natural light even in January). Jocie Golbourn was our assigned wedding planning specialist and she is so kind, sweet, patient and professional. All our guests loved the venue but many actually commented on how flawless and seamless the day was organised and rooms decorated and prepared from each section of the wedding and we only have Jocie and venue staff to thank for their meticulous planning and preparations. The food and drinks were delicious. Couldn’t recommend this venue enough- we actually booked the venue on a whim and were SO happy when we visited for an open day. There’s no false advertisements- it’s stunning."
V230,Gosfield Hall,"Everything, from start to finish, was exactly what we wanted and more. The preparation was helped by our wonderful personal manager, Tara, and accommodated each and every one of our requests and needs. The venue is gorgeous, food delicious, and atmosphere felt special. Our friends and family all told us that this was such a spectacular wedding for them that it was the best they've ever been to. We felt completely taken care of, kept us calm and happy throughout the day, and kept all of our suppliers in place and to standard. It felt glamourous and unique. We wish we could relive the day over and over. It really was our dream wedding."
V230,Gosfield Hall,"We got married in Gosfield Hall in May and had the most amazing wedding day that any couple could ask for. The whole experience from the arrival the night before to leaving the day after was seamlessly managed by the team at the venue.
The house and the grounds looked absolutely stunning and Ellie and the team did a brilliant job at keeping the day running smoothly without making anyone feel rushed. Everyone there was immensely friendly and helpful and we really felt that everyone who worked there was invested in making our day feel special.
We fell in love with the venue when we booked it but the whole experience exceeded out expectations so much that we wish we could do it all again!"
V230,Gosfield Hall,"I wanted to take a moment to commend and state our appreciation for Jocie. She truly was phenomenal, approachable and no task was too big.
We had 5 months to plan our wedding and we loved every moment. With us both working in the service industry it was great to have someone who was so switched on and would be an asset to have on any team."
V230,Gosfield Hall,"Having just got married at Gosfield Hall I can honestly say it was the most beautiful venue and the most perfect day. The staff were so attentive and professional. The food was outstanding and the drinks and cocktails were fabulous. They couldn’t do enough to make sure our day was everything we’d dreamt of. I have to say a special thanks to Ellie - one of the wedding coordinators on site - she went above and beyond to help us plan our day and was there from the very moment I woke up delivering fresh pastries for breakfast to the moment she made me a cup of tea to go to bed with. I can’t thank you enough Ellie, you are an absolute credit to Gosfield Hall."
V231,Kingston Estate Totnes,"When I first enquired with Kingston I thought it would be too expensive but we explained what are budget was and when we wanted to get married and they put a quote together that was affordable.
We have just had the most amazing one day wedding which didn't finish until the early hours. We got married in the Long Barn where there are chandeliers running down the middle, it was very romantic. There is this nightclub at Kingston which is very cool which everyone loved. The guests all said the venue was stunning and the food was out of this world.
A few of us stayed the night before and most of our guests stayed the night of the wedding in the cottages and barns. The staff were brilliant and they coordinated the whole day for us. I cant recommend the venue enough."
V231,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had a two day wedding at the Kingston Estate. All our guests were completely blown away by it.
Most of our friends and family had traveled far for the weekend and were not disappointed when then arrived as the cottages and barns are gorgeous. Some even have hot tubs.
Jodie and the Weddings Team organised a welcome party for the first night which was unreal along with providing street style food for everyone around 8.30 pm. At Kingston they have this really cool enormous Yurt and food hut which is used the day before the wedding and for breakfast.
On the wedding day itself we got married in the Walled Garden and there were endless canapes during the drinks reception. We then decided to eat in the Hayloft Barn which has glass windows overlooking all the gardens.
We used the clear span marquee for our reception party and had the craziest cover band before we all went into the nightclub until 3 am. The good thing about Kingston is everything is included they let you use things like cake stands, easels, knifes, speakers, microphones, all furniture at no extra cost, they set everything up for you and then clean up afterwards. We didn]t have to do anything which made everything totally stress free.

Thank you Jodie, Ellie and Charlotte it was insane !!"
V231,Kingston Estate Totnes,"We recently had the most magical wedding at Kingston. From the moment we set foot onto the grounds, we knew it was the perfect place for our special day. It was our first viewing… and nothing else compared for us (we saw a total of 6 venues). What stood out to us the most was the variety of spaces available for each part of the day. The selection of ceremony areas, the beautiful outdoor spots for photos, the yurt for the night before party, and a special one for us… the underground nightclub for the evening! As party lovers, this was a part that sold it for us; there was somewhere for every moment.

One of the things we loved most was the flexibility to personalize every aspect of our wedding. The venue truly felt like a blank canvas that we could transform into our dream setting, but equally, we got away with doing absolutely nothing as it was beautiful all on its own.

But what truly made our experience unforgettable was the incredible staff, led by Jodie. They were not only professional and attentive but also genuinely warm and welcoming. Their support and attention to detail ensured that everything ran smoothly, allowing us to relax and fully enjoy our day.

We're hoping to return and stay in the future, for a special occasion.

It's not just a wedding venue; it's a place that holds a special spot in our hearts as the backdrop to the beginning of our happily ever after 🤍"
V231,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Kingston was perfect. Despite a rainy start, the day was amazing and Jodie was available but subtly in the background allowing the day to be ours."
V231,Kingston Estate Totnes,"After over a two and a half year wait due to Covid, our son and his wife had a wonderful wedding weekend. Jodie from Kingston Estate and her team of staff went above and beyond to ensure the wedding ran smoothly. Every detail was dealt with professionally. The accommodation, venue and food were all excellent and all our guests many from overseas had a wonderful time. The only thing Jodie could not oversee was the weather but even a little rain didn't spoil the celebrations."
V231,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue and staff were brilliant from start to finish. The venue is really multi-functional and caters for rain or shine. The weather was really unpredictable around the time of our wedding but I was a stress free bride knowing they had it in hand. The food supplier was stunning - we had a weekend package which all the guests raved about. That coupled with the unlimited drinks pages made it the perfect venue for us. A Devon treasure that feels like being on a film set - everyone loved it!
V231,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Such a beautiful venue - we loved it so much. The food was incredible and despite having a changeover of wedding planner close to the wedding day, it had no impact on our day what so ever. The venue are calm and professional and loved their approach to communication which was friendly."
V231,Kingston Estate Totnes,Fell in love with the venue on our first visit. We were particularly looking for a venue which could cater us for 3 days and sleep the majority of the the guests. The grounds were well kept especially the walled garden which is where the ceremony took place. The team were a pleasure and made the day truly special.
V231,Kingston Estate Totnes,"Our 3-day wedding celebrations were spent at the STUNNING Kingston Estate - a truly unique venue that we absolutely fell in love with. It had EVERYTHING we were looking for & more. The grounds are perfectly manicured all year round & come complete with walled garden. The cottages & main house are beautifully decorated, providing luxurious accommodation for 86 of our guests. Sarah & the team were such a pleasure to work with & couldn’t do enough for us. The catering was also top notch. Thank you"
V231,Kingston Estate Totnes,The venue was great we had a few personal health issues beforehand but the team went above and beyond to make the day extra special. The wedding planner organised everything for us and they had plenty of props on site that we were free to use. We had the whole place to ourselves for the weekend it was brilliant and our friends loved the hot tub and pool.
V232,Holmewood Hall,"We were married at Holmewood Hall on 15th February 2025 and I can honestly say that it was the most magical day. We went to visit the venue and instantly fell in love with it but even we were blown away by how beautiful everything looked on the day. All of the staff were amazing - special shoutout to our personal wedding manager, Laura Pike, who was always on hand to answer any questions - she couldn’t do enough for us! The food was wonderful & we had full control over the menu. Would highly recommend this venue, you won’t regret it!"
V232,Holmewood Hall,"Holmewood Hall was an absolutely perfect wedding venue. The house is stunning, well cared for and beautifully decorated. All of the staff are so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Our Wedding Coordinator was fantastic, available from early morning of the wedding and was still there the morning after working for us. The food was excellent, drinks and canapes were amazing and the venue took care of everything for us. We had the most perfect wedding and are so pleased we chose Holmewood Hall. The Gold Room where we had our ceremony is gorgeous. Thank you for giving us a beautiful wedding!"
V232,Holmewood Hall,"I cannot fault this venue at all, the venue itself is breathtakingly beautiful with magnificent rooms and very lovingly maintained grounds. The staff are incredibly friendly, professional and efficient, our wedding coordinator Lee was a pleasure to work with and made our special day run smoothly. If you want a hassle free wedding with breathtaking grounds and the most amazing staff then this is the venue for you."
V232,Holmewood Hall,"Had the most amazing wedding here recently and cannot recommend it enough.

The venue itself is stunning and the options included in the luxe package covered everything we could've possibly wanted and made planning the wedding 100x less stressful.

The staff were all amazing from start to finish, Katie showed us around initially and then Lee was our personal wedding manager, and they were both incredible throughout. Always on hand to answer any questions and help us through the day once we got there.
We had so many comments from our guests on how lovely the staff were on the day!

A particular highlight though was the food - the tasting evening was a dream and the chef went above and beyond to provide a full vegan menu for us which wasn't limited to only a couple of options.
Again, we had so many non-vegan guests complimenting the food and saying how lovely it was!

Overall, an incredible day and an incredible venue.
Thank you so much to everyone there!"
V232,Holmewood Hall,"This place is simply just amazing 🤩
We had our wedding here on 17-12-24 and it was everything we dreamed of and more. The food, staff, decor were just perfect not forgetting the most beautiful Christmas tree 😍
Our person wedding planner Lee was an absolute god send not just having him there on the day but always being at the end of a phone to answer any questions or worry’s.
If we could go back and do it all again we would and not change a single thing.
The most perfect day at the most perfect venue ♥️"
V232,Holmewood Hall,Perfect venue for a wedding with guest numbers 60 - 100. Our guests and I moved from each room to a new room throughout the day and every room had a new surprise. The bridal suite was lush and it was great having all our guests staying under one roof. I would 100% recommend this to anyone.
V232,Holmewood Hall,"The wedding day and lead up to the day were fab. However, for the price we paid, we expected a little bit more.
I opted to use the bridal cottage the evening before for which we paid £450 extra. This is something I now regret, as there was no hot water and we were not able to order any food in as all the take away options were shut (on a Friday night). The hot tub also needed a good clean. So the night before/morning of my wedding was not ideal. I flagged this to the manager who advised that we should have raised the cold water issue as soon as possible, but seeing as we were trying to have morning showers on the wedding day, this did not leave us any time.
Our package included pre-drinks, wine with dinner and we also purchased a cocktail ""cart"" (cocktails on a table) and a bucket of beers. The groom, who is not a wine fan, asked for a beer with his wedding meal and was presented with a contactless card machine to pay for it at the top table. We felt this was a bit unnecessary as there was a full bucket of extra beers outside and it felt a little embarrassing having a card machine presented to us at the top table on our wedding day for one measly Corona, despite the huge amount we had paid. Also, guests were unknowingly allowed to buy beers from the bar after the meal, despite there being available beers to them already in a bucket next to the bar...
Overall the wedding was lovely, but for the price we paid we expected a bit better. Essentially, I loved the venue, but I wish we had not purchased any extras!"
V232,Holmewood Hall,"We got married at Holmewood Hall on 4th October 2024. From the first moment we stepped into the venue and I saw the magnificent Gold room I knew this would be the perfect place for us to get married. We had the most amazing day which was perfectly coordinated by the whole team at Holmewood but especially so by our personal wedding manager Lee. Lee was always quick to respond to any questions we had in the lead up to the day and nothing was too much trouble for him.
We honestly wish we could do it all over again as it was a magical day. We would recommend Holmewood Hall to anyone looking for the perfect venue."
V232,Holmewood Hall,"After getting engaged in late March this year we wanted to get married fairly quickly so booked Holmewood for the same September. The venue, grounds, accomodation were all stunning and we felt very fortunate it was within budget and the package we got was outstanding in comparison to other venues and what it included, which was far far more than other venues. We got to attend a luxe event to choose all our wedding food, canapés, cocktails and wines which should have made things easier but due to the unbelievable quality it made it harder! Our wedding planner Lee is literally the most fantastic person. He was flexible, fun, engaged and on absolutely everything. The day was ran impeccably and also smooth even with some weather concerns and speeches taking a bit longe than we thought. If you book here ask for Lee!! We had the most perfect day. Can’t fault a single things. Our guests all told us how incredible everything was with one even saying he will now longer not attend any further weddings unless it’s at Holmewood. Thank you to all the staff and as mentioned a huge special thank you to Lee! Your a legend!"
V232,Holmewood Hall,"Exceptional venue, stunning grounds, fantastic DJ, and excellent service. Highly recommended! Happiest day of my life 😊"
V233,Bourton Hall,"We got married at Bourton Hall on 08 March 2025 and our wedding planner was Harminder. The day was absolutely amazing from start to finish. All the food and drinks were of a high standard and presented beautifully which includes the wedding breakfast, canapés and cocktails, and breakfast the next day. The venue is gorgeous with lots of rooms, well maintained grounds and exclusive use. The staff are friendly and accommodating and the event was really well managed. We would like to particularly thank Harminder, who was supportive throughout the wedding planning process and the wedding day, ensuring things ran smoothly and in a timely manner. He is a great communicator, provided advice and guidance where needed and attention to detail. We really had a magical day! Thank you so much! We would happily do it all over again and would definitely recommend this venue!"
V233,Bourton Hall,"What a fabulous wedding venue! Because it's a wedding venue and not a hotel that holds the occasional wedding, they really focused on what was important and anticipated our every need. It's an elegant venue but with a comfortable feel to it. The team are incredibly accommodating and helpful and each couple is allocated their own personal wedding manager to guide them through the process and to make sure every detail is covered.
There's a beautiful chapel on site where non-religious ceremonies can be held - this was fabulous.
The food was plentiful and delicious - all our guests raved about it. Great choice of welcome drinks and canapes, wines and cocktails.
The grounds are gorgeous; a perfect backdrop for our October wedding.
The venue was exclusively ours and has beautiful bedrooms, including a huge, stunning bridal suite. Most of our guests stayed overnight and took advantage of the brilliant breakfast in the morning so it really extended the celebration."
V233,Bourton Hall,"Our wedding at Bourton Hall was better than we ever imagined. The Italianate mansion is truly spectacular inside and out however it is the team that made our day run perfectly. Our guests found the setting and the food incredible, they were very impressed! Our wedding planner Emily Sarjant was fantastic her knowledge and expertise made our day magical from start to finish, with all the special touches that she suggested. Our first dance was created in such a beautiful way it will be a memory we cherish forever. Thank you to Emily and the team at Bourton Hall. My husband would also like to note that the croquembouche was amazing and everyone should have one."
V233,Bourton Hall,"My wife and I got married at Bourton Hall in September, with our wedding managed by the wonderful Eleni. Everything about the day went as perfectly as we could've wished, right from arrival to departure the following day. The venue is stunning, and the food was lovely, and having 21 bedrooms on site was such a bonus so that all of our close friends and family could stay on site with us.
Bourton Hall did everything they could both in the run up to the day and on the day itself to alleviate all stress to ensure everything ran as seamlessly as possible, which it absolutely did.
We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall enough."
V233,Bourton Hall,"We were married on 28th July 2024. What an amazing day we had at Bourton Hall. Could not fault it! The venue is so elegant! The grounds and views were to die for. The food was out of this world with so many choices and all cooked and served to perfection. Accommodation / rooms were plentiful and luxurious. Lovely to have a chapel on site too. We had the whole place to ourselves, we felt like royalty! Lots of varied rooms and areas for people to choose where they wanted to be after the wedding breakfast. We would choose the venue all over again!"
V233,Bourton Hall,"We had both our wedding ceremony and reception at Bourton Hall and the service was superb throughout. The house and grounds are beautiful with amazing views to go with them. The staff were professional and helpful during the lead up to our wedding day and during the day as well - even when we had an emergency prior to the ceremony which caused delays, the venue staff were able to work around this to move timings back in order to allow all of our planned activities to go ahead and be fully enjoyed. All the food was delicious and we had a wonderful wedding day thanks to Bourton Hall."
V233,Bourton Hall,"We had the most perfect wedding day at Bourton Hall. Throughout the planning process and on the day, the team were so professional, which meant we could relax and know that everything was in their capable hands - Emily was an amazing wedding manager. The building is beautiful inside and out, and the grounds are stunning - there are so many places for beautiful photos, and views out over the countryside. The food was absolutely delicious, it was so hard to choose what to have! It was also so helpful to have so many places for guests to sit and chat in the evening, away from the disco room but still part of the action. Having so many bedrooms onsite (not to mention a stunning bridal suite!) was an added bonus. We couldn't recommend Bourton Hall highly enough, and have had so many comments from guests saying what a beautiful, elegant but relaxed day it was, so I know they really appreciated everything Bourton has to offer too. Thank you so much to Emily and the whole team for giving us such a perfect day!"
V233,Bourton Hall,"As the Bride and Groom we were made to feel like nothing was too much to ask and they couldn't do enough to make us feel special.
All the guests commented that it was one of the prettiest and most relaxed weddings they have been to.
We could not have asked for a better wedding day thanks to Bourton!"
V233,Bourton Hall,"I had my wedding on 10/02/2024 I am so happy I chose this venue, It is really magical. My wedding manager was just the best! Emily went above and beyond to help me on my big day! I cannot thank her enough.

One of the main things about this venue is that t has its own chappel which is really special and makes you wedding seem more traditional, however there are more options/ rooms available. I wanted the wow factor and I got it.

Some of the options that made it great

*Onsite accommodation for night before and night of the wedding is really helpful
*Exclusive use
*Dedicated wedding manager definate gamechanger! (Emily)
*Menu choices are fantastic.

Everyone commented on the food being really nice ( we had the lamb) The evening buffet was also great. I paid extra to have a meal created as having part of my culture within the food at the wedding was very important to me, they did not disappoint.
Emily was perfect in so many ways, she knew exactly my vision once i explained it to her and she made sure that it became real for me. She adapted parts of the day so that it would work better, for example bringing the canapes outside whilst photos where being taken. Helping me into my dress, looking after my phone just everything I needed she was there. She really worked hard to make sure it run perfectly and it did.

Thank you emily!!! You made my day Great."
V233,Bourton Hall,We got married at Bourton Hall on 30th July 2023. It was the most amazing day ever! We are still receiving compliments from our guests on how stunning the venue was and the whole running of the day. This was 100% down to our wedding co-ordinator Harminder. He went above and beyond to ensure our day was absolutely perfect. He literally could not have done any more! Thank you again Harminder!!
V234,B&H Buildings,Bourne & Hollingsworth was such an exceptional venue for our wedding this September. This is the perfect place for you if you want a true London wedding that feels like a fun dinner/house party but on an epic scale. We used the top floor (the studios) for our sit down dinner (think candle light and tasty roast lamb) and headed downstairs for our reception with the basement club (below and hidden) for late night dancing. The place is stunning (greenery and glass everywhere and the cocktails are insane but what really makes this place are the people. The whole staff from Matt and Lizzie to the bar team to the dinner crew made our whole day seamless and so fun. Could not recommend B&H more highly for your London wedding.
V234,B&H Buildings,"Beautiful wedding celebration in the most stylish venue - we had an intimate wedding reception (drinks, dinner and more drinks!) at the Bourne & Hollingsworth Buildings. The staff members on duty were excellent - nothing was too much trouble and they served everyone with such professionalism. We couldn’t recommend it highly enough and we haven’t stopped talking about it since. All of our guests were so impressed with the space and how stylish it was. The bar, restaurant and greenhouse are all aesthetically beautiful and the botanical vibes make for a very relaxed, but premium setting. Special shout out to Lizzie who helped us coordinate everything and Matt on the day who led the team. Thank you so much - we had the best day and we couldn’t have wished to host it in a better venue."
V234,B&H Buildings,"India & the B&H team were seamless. Flexible, responsive, kind, and easy to deal with. They made our day so special. The food was fantastic, the drinks were lovely, and the value for money was first rate!"
V235,Leez Priory,"I never in my life thought I would get married in a place like Leez priory! The whole experience from start to finish was just fantastic. The price breakdown was manageable and there was no pressure to take any upgrades offered. The things we got in our package were phenomenal and having a wedding planner was tremendous - our lady (Leanne) was an absolute god send!
They catered to all our needs and we were made to feel so comfortable and nothing was a problem! I’d highly suggest going to an event there before hand, just to get a feel of what it’s like full of people and enjoy their delicious food. We actually enjoyed their entertainer ( singer) so much we hired him for our wedding ☺️
Lee priory is just so beautiful. I can’t speak highly enough x"
V235,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory on the 7th of September 2024. Considering how long they have been a wedding venue, they were pretty flexible with some of the ideas we had for the venue styling that turned out amazingly!

The staff really made the day something special and couldn't have done enough for us. Special mention must be made for Leanne, our wedding planner, who was amazing!

Highly recommend the venue and the incredible team that helped to make our day so special!"
V235,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in October 2024. This venue is stunning both inside and out with immaculately kept grounds and interior. The hospitality in the lead up to and on the day of the wedding was fantastic. The food was also brilliant. Another great perk of this venue is the amount of on site accommodation.

A couple of drawbacks / experiences during our wedding. There are only a few toilets in the main building which kept blocking and overflowing throughout the evening which led to us taking some guests to the dressing room or honeymoon cottage to use the facilities. You are also restricted by the venue on any external food or drink suppliers and the venues optional extras for this are quite expensive for what they are.

That asaide, we had the best day and evening at Leez Priory and would certainly recommend it!"
V235,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in August 2024- great venue and experience from initial viewing to leaving the morning after the wedding. Leanne acted as our wedding planner and was friendly, professional and helpful throughout. We opted for the classic package and the food was amazing quality with everyone commenting how full they were!
The venue is beautiful with several options for ceremony both inside and out. Accommodation was great too. The whole day ran smoothly with perfect weather - we will have very happy memories of our day!"
V235,Leez Priory,"Perfect venue and very attentive staff, lovely food and great communication from start to finish"
V235,Leez Priory,"Stunning venue. Fantastic Team. Very accommodating toward our unique ""surprise"" strategy. Our guests were truly surprised. Thank you."
V235,Leez Priory,"Leez priory was the 1st and only venue we looked around when we started planning our wedding. From the moment we stepped on the premises, everything just looked so perfect and exactly what we wanted from a wedding venue. When we got assigned our wedding co-ordinator Rachel, she was just absolutely spot on with everything we asked for and nothing was too big an ask for her. She made sure the day ran as smoothly as possible and took care of any issue that arose without me knowing (which I am forever grateful for!!)
The rest of the staff were amazing and very helpful.

The venue itself is just absolutely stunning and we loved that it has the pub area as well as the dance floor so it catered to all of our guests.

All of the rooms were lovely and it was so nice being able to stay in the fisherman’s lodge onsite the night before the wedding.

We genuinely cannot recommend this venue enough and it was 100% worth the money! 10/10!"
V235,Leez Priory,"We got married on a Tuesday in October to maximise the value of what we could get for our money; and honestly, we got everything we wanted and more. Leanne, our Wedding Manager was perfect at bringing an attention to detail and seamless organisation to the big day, and in the lead up. There wasn't one moment of the day where we felt stressed, as Leanne had it covered. In one particular instance, our flowers for the bridal party's hair hadn't arrived. Within five minutes of telling Leanne that we needed this, the flowers were with our hair and make-up suppliers to add the finishing touches.

Leez Priory as a venue is the most stunning setting, and offers an incredible range of areas in which the ceremony and reception can take place. There is also the opportunity for the bridal party to make use of the Fisherman's Cottage the night before the wedding, and for people to stay in the on-site accommodation on the evening of the wedding, making it the perfect venue for people also travelling from further afield.

Leez Priory were very accommodating, welcoming and were happy to work with us to make our day as perfect as possible. The food was incredible, and a total hit with all of our guests, and so many people have commented on how incredible the day was as a whole. You wouldn't be disappointed to choose Leez Priory."
V235,Leez Priory,They catered to our every need. To when we would ask for things they hadn’t been done before they still made sure it went smoothly. Leanne was amazing she made me feel so comfortable from the start. The whole day was stunning. Beautiful venue please go view it as you will not be disappointed
V235,Leez Priory,We got married on the 26 May 2024. This venue was absolutely brilliant! They catered for every need and made sure there was no stress on the day. Leanne was kind and level headed throughout and was always one step ahead! Do not hesitate to book- do it now!
V236,London Rowing Club,"We picked this place because we wanted somewhere fairly central and casual. We fell in love with the long room and the view. Our wedding was in October so we thought we'd have it cosy but we ended up with a beautiful autumnal day so everyone was on the balcony. The fairy lights were perfect and the other rooms were great to avoid leaving. The staff was so friendly and accommodating that we would definitely recommend the venue.

The only thing that could have tainted the day is that after three visits and many emails, we were never told that the river floods (a lot). We were flexible with our day so if we knew this we would have built it into our day, instead, I was told by the photographer on the day as I got out of the taxi that we wouldn't be able to take any group photos because the area would be flooded during the cocktail hour and half that we had assigned as photo time. This would have been disappointing but we all ended up running outside after the ceremony to take photos before the tide came in. My husband and I borrowed wellies for our couple photos. We had fun doing this, but I can imagine many couples being upset! My friend's electric car also flooded and they were obviously upset."
V236,London Rowing Club,"Annabel was meticulous in her help planning the wedding. Very knowledgeable and helpful.
On the day the rest of the staff were brilliant - there wasn’t an empty glass in the house.
Great venue at a reasonable price on the London riverside."
V236,London Rowing Club,"LRC was the perfect place to celebrate our wedding this summer. The venue staff went above and beyond to ensure that everything went as planned both before and during the event. Thanks in particular to Annabel who was responsive, helpful and always put us at ease in the build up. The location is stunning - couldn’t have asked for a better day!"
V236,London Rowing Club,"We just wanted to say an enormous thank you for everything. From the moment we came to visit the LRC on a slightly grey January weekend, we knew it would be a fabulous venue for our June wedding reception and it certainly did not disappoint. It really is the most beautiful setting and we have very fond memories of our guests enjoying drinks in the sunshine with the most fantastic view over the Thames. The venue has such character and lends itself beautifully to a wedding reception. We have received so many compliments from our guests and I would encourage anyone thinking about booking their wedding at the LRC to do it, you will not regret it! We were lucky to be blessed with beautiful weather so were able to have our jazz musicians play on the balcony for the drinks reception before moving into the Long Room for our meal. It looked stunning with the tables dressed and mantles adorned with flowers. Following the meal and speeches, guests enjoyed drinks back on the balcony and in the Fairburn and Members Rooms which provide plenty of seating, whilst the Long Room was cleared and the band set up. We then partied the night away.

From start to finish, the organisation was so straight forward. Annabel was very accommodating and full of helpful advice in the run up. I knew that on the day she would ensure things ran like clock work, which of course they did. Our suppliers also commented on how helpful the LRC team were to work with. On the day the staff were brilliant and went out of their way to ensure everything ran smoothly (including borrowing some large gym fans from the rowers to put in the Long Room to keep us cool as it was an unexpectedly hot day). We really can’t thank you enough and now need to think of an excuse to host another party with you in the future!"
V236,London Rowing Club,"We got married in St. Mary's church and then had our reception in the London Rowing Club in February 2023. It far exceeded our expectations and was an incredible fabulous stress-free day with thanks to the wonderful Annabel making the day just run.

In the lead up to the event, Annabel was incredibly responsive, helpful and helped us plan the day exactly how we wanted it. She answered all our questions really quickly, always got back to us, was very flexible with what we could do and allowing us to personalise the space. Prior to the event, Annabel arranged for us to go and have a look around on a couple of additional occasions to help us plan how we would want it to look. She also gave our caterers a tour of the kitchens as they were new to the venue.

In the immediate lead up to the day, Annabel helped with our suppliers in getting chairs delivered and bringing all the wine over a day earlier. On the day, she helped to make the day flow and just dealt with things throughout the day.

The venue itself is beautiful with three rooms to use. A middle reception room, a cosy snug and the main long room. In the main long room, there is a rowing boat hanging upside down with fairly lights. The main lighting can be dimmed and gave a wonderful atmosphere for the evening meal. As our wedding was a winter wedding, it was fairly chilly so they lit fires in the main room and snug which added to the atmosphere.

We had around 90 guests - could have fitted a few more just about. We used the round tables, tablecloths, linen, plates cutlery and glasses provided and they were perfect for a wedding and looked very smart. No need to hire these. As mentioned, we did hire separate wedding chairs instead of the conference chairs provided. There's a lot of decoration in the way of rowing memorabilia on the walls which means you don't have to actually do too much to make it interesting for guests.

Overall, the perfect London wedding venue with absolutely fabulous views across the Thames with a long balcony to enjoy from. To top it off Annabel is truly amazing and so helpful."
V236,London Rowing Club,"We had our wedding (ceremony+reception) at LRC in July, and the venue itself and the team we worked with were absolutely incredible! Everything on the day went without a hitch and we heard so many compliments on the location - our guests loved the balcony and the layout inside, which included plenty of space for anyone wanting a break from dancing to sit down and relax. Would recommend to anyone looking to host an event!"
V236,London Rowing Club,"London Rowing Club is a truly fantastic venue and we were both so delighted with how our day went! The venue has real character with the classic rowing memorabilia and it’s location on the Thames, and looks amazing when it’s all set up. The layout and size of rooms I thought were perfect for our wedding of about 70 (+15ish more in the evenings) and of course the big attraction is the balcony which all of our guests adored!! (I wish I’d had more time during the day to stand out there and enjoy it 😂). Not only is it a fantastic venue in a great location but what really made this the most amazing venue was how great all of the staff, and all the recommend suppliers were! The day exceeded expectations and we got compliments on the place and the staff from all our guests. Couldn’t be happier with the venue, it was perfect for us!!"
V236,London Rowing Club,"We found the London Rowing Club while desperately combing through London locations after our original venue fell through a few months before the day.
Luckily for us it was available due to a cancellation - kismet!
From the start the charming Annabel put us very much at ease and helped us to envisage the day as we hoped it would be. She was very flexible and helpful throughout the planning process.
We were incredibly lucky with the weather on the day and the venue really came into its own - it was virtually impossible to get guests off the terrace, which is the perfect size for our smallish event (65 people) and of course offers gorgeous river views.
We were well looked after by the team and everything went off without a hitch. The interior of the space itself is lovely with a great sense of history.
Nice additional touch - table tennis was made available in the entry room for the later part of the evening!

It's a special place and I'd thoroughly recommend for anyone seeking a memorable spot to tie the knot!"
V236,London Rowing Club,"We got married at the London Rowing Club on a brilliantly sunny winter day on Saturday. All the way through in the run up (after 2 years or more of postponements), Annabel and team bent over backwards to help us arrange everything, recommended some brilliant suppliers for food (Shona Pollock comes highly recommended) and flowers (same with Steph the charityflorist.)

So many of our guests said how lovely the venue and staff were on the day, and the whole place looked a million dollars with an amazing photo set on and around the balcony and river - although we haven't seen those yet. The corkage and bar tariff prices are also incredibly reasonable for an inner London location!

I can't recommend the LRC highly enough. It will live in memory for a very long time."
V236,London Rowing Club,"The London Rowing Club team alongside the Dinner Ladies went above and beyond to ensure that we had the wedding perfectly fitting our requirements. Throughout the entire all of the suppliers worked seamlessly together to ensure the space transformed as we progressively added guests and transitioned between eating, our ceremony, more eating, music and dancing. We wouldn’t have had it any other way. The attention to detail of the team is second to none - perfect for any bride and groom seeking a beautiful event."
V237,The Prince Albert,"The team at The Prince Albert were always accommodating, made everything easy and stress-free, and helped us organise an amazing wedding party. They really knew what they were doing, and helped guide us through the process calmly, working around our schedule (which wasn't easy - we live abroad!) to make sure all our last-minute worries and concerns were sorted smoothly. The food was excellent, and the space was fantastic for our party. Can't recommend it highly enough!"
V237,The Prince Albert,"We had such a happy wedding with Harrison and this venue. Harrison was really flexible and answered any questions we had and made great suggestions when we needed seating arrangements, the schedule for the day, a florist, and more. The day was accessible to everyone and the food and drink were perfect. Thank you for making out wedding stress free and wonderful."
V237,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert was the most wonderful venue for our London wedding. We came across the venue at there wedding fair and chose alot of our suppliers from the same wedding fair.

Harrison and Lauren were always so on hand to help with any questions and did a fantastic job answering all of our questions. The staff were so friendly and helpful and made everything run like clockwork.

We couldn’t recommend The Prince Albert enough for a london wedding and would love to do it all again."
V237,The Prince Albert,"My wife and I were beyond happy with how everything went on our wedding day. Harrison, Diana, Claudio and the whole team were absolutely phenomenal! It was such a beautifully efficient operation, and we always felt like someone was there to help us when needed.

We've had dozens of compliments about the great food and how wonderfully intimate the venue was for a wedding. Some of our more traditional relatives said they were initially sceptical at the prospect of a pub wedding, but that it was one of the most beautiful and joyful weddings they’d been to. A friend of mine was also very happy that someone at the bar remembered her drink order throughout the evening! On top of that, everything ran perfectly to schedule, which is no doubt down to the high attention to detail.

It was very useful that the upstairs was free on Friday afternoon so that we could set up the space. It gave us plenty of time to do the flower arrangements, put up the bunting, and stick photos on the frame wall.

Thank you again so much for all the help and support you've given us - it really was the best day of our lives (so far)!"
V237,The Prince Albert,"My husband and I got married here in late September 2023, and I cannot recommend the Prince Albert enough!! Booking a wedding venue can be stressful and we felt like a lot of the venues we looked at gave us the ""hard sell"" but the folks at the Prince Albert helped to put us at ease every step of the way. We fell in love with how beautiful the pub was, so hired the upstairs for the ceremony, wedding breakfast and party afterwards for around 40 - 45 people. We were able to drop off decorations the night before and talk it all through with the staff, and they did such a good job of working with us and the florist to get the place looking amazing. The ceremony went off without a hitch, everybody loved the food and we had a blast in the evening. All the staff were amazing, but special shout out to Harrison and Lauren for helping us plan and run the day, and Maria for managing everything on the ground both when we dropped off the decorations and during the wedding itself. Thank you again for helping us celebrate our special day with our loved ones, for making it so stress free and so memorable!"
V237,The Prince Albert,"All you ever hear about wedding venues is that everything is a rip off, the food is meh, and there are a ton of annoying restrictions...the opposite is true of Harrison and The Prince Albert team. From Day 1, Harrison made the whole process not only easy but really fun! He was quick to respond, super knowledgeable, and very accommodating; he even helped our best man execute a surprise for us without it disrupting any timings. On the day, they decorated the place beautifully, managed to serve a 3 course dinner to 76 people unbelievably fast, and everyone raved about the food - to say they did a good job is a gross understatement, they went above and beyond. We were after ""classy fun"" and that's exactly what we got - thank you so so much!"
V237,The Prince Albert,"We had the exact wedding reception we wanted at the Prince Albert thanks to Harrison, Claudio and the other amazing staff who helped us feel so relaxed in the build up and during. We wanted a very low-key vibe and the team understood that but there were enough options for any style of wedding you wanted. The upstairs function room felt cozy and intimate while still leaving breathing room and space to dance, but you could easily rent the whole place if you wanted more guests and even choose to do your ceremony there. We had the most compliments on our food (we chose a buffet option). The team were particularly accomodating to some complicated dietary requirements and it was all delicious."
V237,The Prince Albert,"July 6, 2023 was the most memorable day of our lives! A big thank you to Harrison and the rest of the team for assisting us through out the whole process. Our guests loved the Prince Albert pub especially the sumptuous food and booze on our wedding day!

David & Dannah"
V237,The Prince Albert,"The Prince Albert is a Great venue for the classic Pub Wedding.
Harrison and the team did an amazing job to organize everything. The food was great and the service first class. Only sorry it was over so quickly. Thanks again for everything."
V237,The Prince Albert,"We found The Prince Albert when our original venue cancelled on us less than 2 months before our wedding. & we are so glad we did; everything happens for a reason! From the moment we met Harrison, we knew we were in safe hands, and the team at the Prince Albert made our day amazing. The pub looked beautiful and we were very greatful for the effort the team put in putting up all our decorations. We had so many compliments about the food, and we were very impressed in the swift and organised manner in whichever it was served. Everyone had a wonderful time, and we would not hesitate in recommending The Prince Albert."
V238,Kindred,"We chose Kindred for our 60 person wedding and it could not have been better. We wanted a venue where we could have the ceremony, dinner and dancing all under one roof, that was wheelchair accessible, and easy to get to on the tube, Kindred ticks all those boxes and more!
The food is incredible, we really enjoyed popping by to do all the tastings, we'll continue to come to the Cellar for food and cocktails. Many guests commented on how good the food was.
The place itself is gorgeous, inside and out. We used the whole venue, the main Hall for the ceremony, dinner and dancing, and the Library upstairs for the drinks reception and cake cutting. Also, being right next to Hammersmith station, the venue could not be easier to get to!
The staff are wonderfully attentive and helpful, both before and on the day. They were really open to the little details that made our day uniquely ours, from the drinks selections, to having a table and glasses on stage for the ceremony, to playing our music selections at the right time. Plus its a dog friendly venue!"
V238,Kindred,"We LOVE this venue! We got married here with only 12 weeks notice and Anna, the owner, and her staff went above and beyond to make the day as memorable, magical, and marvellous as we'd hoped it would be. The venue is elegant, stylish and perfect for a London, city based wedding. The food is sensational as it comes from their in-house kitchen on the ground floor and every guest remarked on how delicious their meal was. It's restaurant quality food, not your standard wedding food. The place looks stunning in all our wedding photos and the wedding cake they made us (at very short notice I might add!) was second to none. Everyone loved it. The venue was also perfect for late night dancing and drinking and merriment. It was such a pleasure - and a breeze - to work with Anna and her team on one of the most important days of my life, and I very much hope to do so again in the future. I will forever be grateful to her and all she helped us with."
V238,Kindred,"We had our wedding reception for 35 guests at Kindred, in the Library and Salon earlier this year. The day went incredibly smoothly, the staff couldn't have been more attentive and our guests raved about the food for weeks afterwards. It was the perfect sized space for our intimate celebration, really cosy and the atmosphere was great. The little touches really helped to make the day special, with espresso martinis served for the speeches and sparklers for our exit at the end of the night. Thanks again to the lovely Kindred team!"
V238,Kindred,"I cannot find a single fault in our experience with Kindred for our wedding. Not only was it a stunning venue that honestly made some of our guests gasp as they arrived, but Anna and the team were so incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. Having them support us really took so much of the wedding planning stress away and we knew we were in safe hands. I really appreciated that the team were happy to chat through ideas with me and were always keen to find creative solutions to give us the day that we had envisioned.

The food was absolutely delicious and they were so accommodating for our long list of dietary requirements from our guest. The cocktails were also so delicious. Our guests were buzzing for weeks after, as were we.

On the night, the staff were not only incredibly helpful and efficient, but also just so friendly, welcoming and complimentary. We felt thoroughly spoilt and very well looked after.

We visited so many venues and this was by far the best choice for us. The interiors made for some stunning photos and the layout of the spacing meant that whilst we had 80-100 guests, it still felt very intimate. I cannot recommend Kindred enough!"
V238,Kindred,"We would give a thousand stars if we could. Kindred hosted us for our cocktail style wedding and it was everything we could have hoped for and the perfect venue for this style of wedding. The wine, cocktails and food (incredible grazing board, canapés, bowls and pizzas) were exceptional and the team were on top of everything, friendly and nothing was ever an issue. We would HIGHLY recommend it. We have had loads of guests message us to tell us what a spectacular venue it was with the most friendly team. The venue had different spaces to suit our needs and the AV is amazing - it worked perfectly for our live music band and our DJ, and our own music playlists for our ceremony. They took the stress off planning and really did mean we could relax and not worry that everything would run smoothly. Thank you so much Kindred team for giving us the best day of our lives"
V239,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The best day of our lives and me and my now husband couldn't be more thankful to Bredenbury. Before booking Bredenbury we visited over 17 wedding venues in Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Herefordshire - we fell in love instantly, there is no need for a crazy amount of extra expense on decorations, the venue speaks for itself. The fact that it was no corkage just added to why we wanted to book and the team were so friendly. In the lead up to the wedding they were brilliant, we booked far in advance and brought over all our family members to come see the venue, they were so flexible, understanding and welcoming - they couldn't do enough for us. On the wedding day they had decorated for us by the time we had arrived and all we had to do on the day was to enjoy it - which was perfect. It really was the best day of our lives, all the comments from our family and friends was how beautiful the venue was. They kept the day running so smooth and we didn't need to think about a thing."
V239,Bredenbury Court Barns,"There truly aren't words to describe how incredible Bredenbury Court Barns and their entire team of fantastic staff were through the planning process and the day itself. They were so friendly, supportive and nothing was ever too much. From quick replies to any questions that popped to mind to planning meetings that left us feeling prepared and ready to the day being set up beyond perfectly. Our amazing wedding coordinator Lianna spent the days and months (years really!) leading up to our big day making sure everyone detail was perfect, that everything was incorporated that we'd dreamed of and made sure we didn't feel a moment of stress from start to finish. All throughout the building from the bridal booth, to the orangery to the oak barn was beautifully light and open - even with our wedding being the end of October - and we had so many compliments about this! There aren't enough words to say thank you and explain just how much we'd recommend this venue to everyone"
V239,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We had the perfect day back in July. The weather didn't go to plan but they helped make the day so special even with the last minute switches because of the rain. We had such an amazing day and the feedback from our guests about the venue, food and service was great! We cannot thank the team enough for the effort they put in throughout the whole process but especially on the day. We felt incredibly supported throughout the whole process."
V239,Bredenbury Court Barns,"The venue itself is stunning. The buildings, grounds and interior decorations are all beautiful and immaculately presented. From the moment you turn down the lane it is so picturesque, you know you've found somewhere special. It's exactly what we were imagining for our wedding venue.

The layout is perfect, with ample space for guests to mingle and move about, and great accessibility for older and disabled guests. Ours was a winter wedding, and while most of the day was inside it wasn't cramped and we could still enjoy the beautiful grounds through the expansive windows that run along the whole barn.

All of the venue is stunning, but practicality-wise the Bridal Suite warrants a special mention. Room length mirrors, plenty of room for the bridal party to get ready, have their makeup and hair done, and if there's time to relax as well. Drinks were served from 11 onwards, and it has it's own toilets and shower.

From our first meeting at Bredenbury the staff were exceptional. They gave a reassuring air of professionalism and experience, with just the right level of excitedness for our day without it feeling forced. We were really impressed by how responsive the whole team were, with speedy replies to any questions we had during the planning. This is something we particularly appreciated as we only gave ourselves 7 weeks to plan our big day.

Value for money wise it felt tricky to gauge when we were trying to choose a venue as the headline figure is rarely what you'll end up paying, with different venues charging different amounts for different things. Not the case with Bredenbury. With their No Corkage policy and generosity in being able to use whatever props they already have, any extras were non-essentials of our own choosing.

No Corkage is pretty significant. Some venues wanted to charge £20/bottle, so not having to pay this and being able to supply not only our own wine but beers, gin and soft drinks for the drinks reception and wedding breakfast was not only a massive saving but also made the occasion more personal for us. The bar staff and catering team were excellent, pouring and serving drinks, warming our mulled wine and setting up the gin bar. Once your guests have drunk you dry the venue's bar is well stocked and standard pub pricing.

We wanted a Christmas wedding and seeing in early November that they had a date available that December we couldn't resist. 7 weeks isn't long to organise a wedding with nearly 100 guests, and we couldn't have done it without the Bredenbury team being so organised. Our assigned event manager, Harriet, was brilliant in the runup and on the day, as were all the other managers and staff we spoke with. The Wedding Bible they fill out with you is a great idea and nails down all the finer details to ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible on the day.

We didn't want to have to spend the day before and morning of our wedding worrying about set up and decorations, but needn't have worried as Bredenbury did all of this for us. A meeting beforehand clarified what we wanted where; we simply dropped off boxes of stuff the day before and rocked up in the morning to find everything laid out as hoped.

This organisation extended to the third party suppliers, of which Bredenbury have an extensive list of local recommendations. We booked the ceiling lights with Cotswold Wedding Co. and didn't have to do anything else. The band, Apollo Gold (incredible!!) set up without any hassle and didn't have any issues with Bredenbury's noise limiter. Our florist Katrina Bevis hadn't been there before, but again had no problem getting everything in place on the morning.

On-site accommodation was good for close family and friends, but there's not enough for the majority of guests and the lack of a dedicated honeymoon suite is a bit of a shame. If you want privacy for your first night as a married couple it means taking over an entire lodge. The quality and comfort of the rooms is excellent, though, and the continental breakfast served the morning after in the East Lodge was delicious, with ample options for Vegan and Gluten Free.

Jenkinsons are the exclusive caterer for Bredenbury and have an extensive menu for nibbles, the wedding breakfast and dinner. The menu and ordering process is clear, and pricing is what we expected to pay. Food and service was as slick and faff-free as everything else. A real delight.

On the day, Harriet and the catering manager were absolute superstars. Zero stress, everything ran to time and as planned, and they were always available if we had any questions or needed help.

The whole day was perfect and exactly what we wanted. I don't think we could have achieved this without the exceptional organisation of Harriet and the team. The entire process was very slick, zero stress, and we wouldn't hesitate in recommending Bredenbury Court Barns to anyone looking to get married in a countryside paradise."
V239,Bredenbury Court Barns,"I want to say a massive thank you to Bredenbury Court Barns for hosting our wedding. From the start they were super amazing and accommodating to us. They won us over with their care and support even when we had a pickle in the beginning.

Olivia was super helpful from the start and throughout the year we were planning she offered huge amount of support and suggestions.

We typed in “orangery weddings” in google when we were first looking because I was keen to get a ceremony in an orangery and Bredenbury popped up after much searching. Once we saw the Orangery we cancelled every other viewing we had across the country because we felt we found the perfect place, and nothing compared to the reception with the beautiful windows that brought all the light in. The grounds were absolutely spectacular and gorgeous. It was a no brainer for us to pick such a beautiful venue. They brought my ideas to life and we were able to get support on anything from recommendation of suppliers, to ideas on decor to their favourite meals from Jenkinson’s. They fully outdid themselves in love for us. We can’t forget it.

Our wedding day was exceptional with Lianna helping us all the way. She was a breath of fresh air. She cared about all the little details and made us feel relaxed and had a good laugh with us. The fact she was there 100% of the way, before the wedding, during the wedding, and even after is unmatched! Thank you Lianna for really being there to make our wedding day smooth and relaxing.

The food was incredible too and we often think about how sad it is that we didn’t finish our second plates, we think about it a lot.

Thank you for the wonderful journey BCB, you blew us away with your integrity, kindness, and genuine support!"
V239,Bredenbury Court Barns,thank you to everyone at bredenbury court barns who made our day so special
V239,Bredenbury Court Barns,"From the moment we stepped foot into Bredenbury Court Barns, we knew this was the venue for us. It was the first and only venue we viewed as we were blown away by how gorgeous the venue is. The venue itself is absolutely stunning, with breathtaking views and impeccably maintained grounds that set the perfect backdrop for our special day.

The staff went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. From our first consultation to the last dance, their professionalism and attention to detail were exceptional. Harriet was absolutely brilliant and I don’t know what we would have done without her!

The food was another highlight—our guests are still talking about how delicious everything was! Jenkinsons are amazing, they helped us personalise our menu perfectly!

We couldn’t have asked for a more beautiful venue to have our wedding. The day couldn’t have been more perfect! Thank you to everyone at Bredenbury Court Barns for making our wedding day nothing short of magical!"
V239,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We could not have had a more perfect experience with Bredenbury Court Barns. Right from initial booking all the way through to breakfast the following morning, everything was perfect. Nothing was too much trouble for our wonderful planner, Lianna. She ensured the day ran smoothly and our months of planning turned out exactly as we’d imagined. They are available to answer any questions you have any time, they’re only an email away and get back to you so fast. The venue itself if just gorgeous, the grounds make for some wonderful photos, and the orangery lets so much light in that your ceremony photos are gorgeous. The whole place is fully air conditioned too which was great for our July wedding. The bridal suite is a perfect balance of being aesthetically pleasing and practical for getting ready in, it’s so spacious, lots of natural light, there’s plenty of plug sockets and huge mirrors so everyone has plenty of room for getting ready and no one is on top of eachother. There’s even an outside space for getting some fresh air. I’m so glad we chose to have our wedding here, it’s given us memories to cherish forever and there are zero memories of any stress!! Cannot recommend this venue enough!"
V239,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We cannot believe how lucky we fell to get married at such a beautiful venue. Right from the offset of viewing the venue, to our special day, we were taken of. No question was too silly, and so much pressure was taken off us during the planning. We managed to make everything our own and Lianna was there every step of the way. Thank you for giving us our happily ever after. We will forever be grateful."
V239,Bredenbury Court Barns,"We loved our wedding at Bredenbury the team did an amazing job providing everything we asked for and more. We especially liked that our wedding coordinator for the day, Harriet had thought of everything for us she went above and beyond and even offered to go and get my mum some more shoes when hers broke! absolute 5-star service and the food was amazing too!"

V241,The Vines of Rochester,"We had the most amazing wedding at The Vines! I would 100% recommend this wedding venue. The food, service, running of the day etc was all exceptional. All of our guests commented on how amazing the venue was"
V241,The Vines of Rochester,"We had the most amazing wedding day at The Vines of Rochester. The venue is absolutely beautiful, with so many gorgeous touches throughout.
The staff on the day and the build up were so helpful and accommodating, which meant the day ran so smoothly from start to finish.
We would definitely recommend anyone looking at The Vines as a potential wedding venue - we couldn't have wished for anything more!"
V241,The Vines of Rochester,"Our special day was perfect, and this is credit to the wonderful Vines venue and the amazing team led by Becky and Holly.

The venue is beautiful. So much character and style. We loved getting married in the tippe, very intimate. The dining room did not need a lot of dressing and flowers, some simple styling and the space looked amazing. We loved that there were multiple spaces for our guests to use, the bar area was lively and great for chatting while the dining rooms transformed to a generous dance floor. Then our closest friends and family were able to stay at the venue with us, to enjoy a yummy breakfast the next day.
The location, venue and setting is just perfect.

The whole experience with the Vines team was very professional and well organised. Questions were answered super promptly, with confidence from the super friendly team.
The supper tasting night was great, we were able to sample multiple starters and desserts, although keep an eye out and book early.
The pre wedding appointment went through every detail. There was nothing that they hadn’t considered and care was taken to tailor to our preferences, nothing was a problem.

On the day Becky and Holly were amazing, so attentive, supportive, brilliant ladies, they absolutely made the day with lots of complements from our guests on the high quality of the team. The food was outstanding, thank you to the culinary team.
The DJ was great, tailored to our music preferences and refused any off piste guest requests! Well looked after by the evening team.

We can’t thank you all enough for such a wonderful day."
V241,The Vines of Rochester,"From the initial visit to The Vines, we knew it was the perfect venue for us. The staff team were always on hand to help with any queries or logistical issues we had, answering all of our questions and the online portal was so easy to use. The pricing is clearly laid out and there aren't any hidden or added on costs later on. We mainly dealt with Holly on the lead up to the wedding, and Becky and Will on the day. They were all so helpful and supportive. They took care of a last minute crisis when the lady bringing our dog to be the ring bearer ended up stuck in traffic. Without us even knowing, they sent someone to go and help bring them to the venue on time. Nothing was too much trouble for them. The drinks...good luck deciding what package you want as they are all so delicious. We opted for the festival wedding which was so laid back, but still organised. The food was so good and the evening buffet was lovely. The DJ included liaised with us on the lead up to the wedding and worked with us to put together an idea of what we wanted and what would get people dancing, which worked perfectly. The rooms....there are so many to choose from to be your wedding suite. We opted for a garden room. We gave the others to guests travelling to the wedding and all of the rooms are so beautiful in their own unique way. Becky and Will were on hand all of our wedding day for us and our guests and anything we needed was taken care of without a fuss. The morning after we all had breakfast with our guests that stayed over and that was such a lovely extra touch to add to the wedding. Even the timings that the planners work out mean there are non rushed transitions of moving your items out and the next wedding bringing items in; you barely notice. Being able to store items there a few days before is a huge help! Also in the lead up to the wedding they invited us to a supper evening where we got to enjoy some of the lovely food on offer. In the portal there is also a section for selling and buying wedding items which is very helpful and convenient.
Honestly we couldnt have been happier with our choice of venue and have recommended it to friends that have since gotten engaged. Amazing venue and team x"
V241,The Vines of Rochester,"We instantly fell in love with The Vines, it was the perfect venue for us and we loved having a relaxed festival style wedding meaning we had more time to mingle with our guests. The wedding coordinators were friendly, accommodating and professional. We were in such good hands and were made to feel so special. It really was the best day. Thank you so much, Alex & Tom."
V241,The Vines of Rochester,"We were lucky enough to have held our wedding day at The Vines on 4th November 2023. From start to finish, the whole process was such a breeze. Their communication was always so speedy and thorough (which is what any bride wants). There were never too many small or big questions I could ask them, as they were always so happy to help. It was honestly such a stress free experience for us and they went above and beyond. I cannot thank them enough for everything. The venue, the rooms, the food, the staff… all faultless! We chose the ‘festival’ style wedding to suit us and our guests and we still have guests commenting now on what a fabulous day and experience it was. It was very different from any wedding we had attended, in the best way possible. If my husband would let me do it all again tomorrow, I would!"
V241,The Vines of Rochester,"We had a wonderful day with our friends and family. The venue is beautiful. Such amazing photo opportunities at the venue but also in Rochester with the castle and cathedral. everyone said how lovely it is. All the wedding co-ordinaters were wonderful, any problem or question was always dealt with promptly and professionally. Our venue will always have brilliant memories of our day."
V241,The Vines of Rochester,"We had our wedding here recently and wow what a venue! It’s such a pretty venue and so many of our guests commented on how lovely it is. It has amazing locations for photos, in the sunshine and rain! And we had a mixture of both on our day. But the best thing about the Vines has to be the team that work there. They couldn’t do enough for you. They made everything seem effortless, they were so kind and accommodating and we are so pleased we chose the Vines as our wedding venue. From Becky our duty manager on the day - who was absolutely fabulous and couldn’t have done more for us - to the bar staff, waiting staff, DJ and just everyone we encountered - they were all fabulous. Thank you so much!"
V241,The Vines of Rochester,"Venue is absolutely stunning.
Staff on the day were good & couldn’t do more.
Was sold on the basis we’d have a wedding portal to help us throughout - this is only for a traditional wedding. If having a festival wedding there is nothing.
Personally I felt alone & wasn’t confident until the meeting 8weeks before to go through plans for the day- I felt if anything was not ok it was late to make amendments.
As a second wedding I knew what I wanted but was chilled, however for some this may not be a good experience.

On the day - we had pre arranged a tab with conditions, thus didn’t seem to be adhered too. I had several decorations go missing & I got no response.

We received no contact after the wedding to ask for feedback or to ask if everything was ok"
V242,Solton Manor,"Solton Manor had everything that we dreamed of for our special day. The grounds are just beautiful, the Manor House is full of character and charm and the Dutch Barn definitely has the wow factor.
The team at Solton Manor deserve a special mention. From start to finish, Karen, Jackie and the team were professional, friendly, helpful, extremely hard working and nothing was ever too much trouble. They welcomed our sausage dog, Frankie who was a very important part of our day. A big 'woof' of thanks from him!!
Our guests loved staying in the Manor House and the pretty Dovecote Cottage. The facilities allowed us to make breakfast for our guests the day after which was an added bonus! The games room with a table tennis table was a real hit too!
Highly recommend this fantastic venue!"
V242,Solton Manor,"Our wedding was everything we wanted.
Karen and Jackie were there to help and had lots of ideas to make our dream come true.
We stayed in the Manor House and the Bridal Suite is stunning. The boys used the Games Room to get ready and the girls had the whole Dovecote to themselves.
Food was delicious too!
It was wonderful, thank you so much.
Lena and Christian"
V242,Solton Manor,"Solton Manor was the perfect setting for our special day in October 2023.
Karen and Jackie made us feel at ease and were super responsive with all the planning right from our very first contact.
The day itself was everything that we wanted it to be and would absolutely recommend this venue. Thank you, Abi and Josh"
V242,Solton Manor,"From the moment we arrived at Solton Manor, we knew it was the venue for us. We were met at the door of the historic Manor House and had a fabulous time hearing stories about the house, walking around the gorgeous gardens and visiting the wonderful Dutch Barn - we were already wedding planning!
Our Wedding was such a special weekend and we loved every minute of it.
The venue is magical and you have thought of everything to make it perfect.
Your attention to detail was incredible and your help was so supportive every step of the way.
It was as important to you as it was to us that the day was the day of our dreams and we just cannot believe how perfect it was. Thank you so much for everything. Mandy and Kevin"
V242,Solton Manor,From the booking o the planning to the actual wedding was all so amazing! The team truly went out of their way to make my day the most perfect day ever!
V242,Solton Manor,"From start to finish, the venue were brilliant. Always prompt to respond, ready with help and ideas, flexible and just perfect on our Special Day. What amazing memories we made that day"
V242,Solton Manor,Shelley is so kind and helpful! The venue is stunning and I loved every minute of our wedding day there!
V242,Solton Manor,"We had our wedding in Oct2021 & Solton Manor was the perfect setting for our special day. Shelly handled the whole process from start to finish in such a friendly, helpful & efficient manner. Our wedding was postponed by 1 year due to COVID but Shelly made the whole process stress-free and she was always super responsive. We would thoroughly recommend this wedding venue!"
V243,The Darenth,"Our wedding experience was absolutely perfect! Everything was so well organised, and the staff went above and beyond to accommodate us. Communication throughout the entire process was excellent, making the day completely stress-free. Highly recommended!"
V243,The Darenth,"I cannot recommend the Darenth more. The staff were absolutely incredible, we could not have wanted for more on our day. We were never without a drink, and nothing was too much of an ask. The staff were so friendly to our guests, and really created a relaxed environment. Leading up to the ceremony they made us feel so relaxed and they were very informative. Jason, Kerry, Sarah, Louise and everyone at the Darenth, thank you so much for making our day so special!"
V243,The Darenth,"We found The Darenth when looking for a venue for our twilight wedding. We wanted our wedding to truly reflect us as a couple and where we could be flexible with how the day would go.

When we went to see The Darenth, not only was the venue stunningly beautiful, inside and out, there was a warmth to the place and the team were so friendly and very helpful. From the moment we contacted the team, Lucy was our main contact and couldn’t help us enough. Despite the number of weddings held here, we felt special throughout as if our special day was the main focus for them all. Lucy was great with all the details, understanding what we wanted and offering help and support without pushing anything.

On the day, Jason was amazing at managing the day - making sure we had time to ourselves but that the day ran exactly as we wanted. He was also very supportive and did a great job putting us at ease when we were nervous leading up to the ceremony. The whole team were thoughtful and looked after us all day, making sure we had food and drink and anything else we needed. All our guests commented on how wonderful the staff were and it allowed us to truly focus on enjoying our day. Leigh and Kerry were also fantastic on the day, couldn’t be more helpful.

We had an amazing day, everything went exactly as we hoped and better. A massive part of that was down to The Darenth and their incredible team - we couldn’t recommend highly enough!"
V243,The Darenth,"From the moment you walk into The Darenth we were made to feel comfortable. We were taken on a tour of the venue and booked there and then In October 2022 for September 2023. The staff were knowledgable and professional which is what made us book this venue.

Communication was always good throughout, we visited several times with different family members and the staff were alway welcoming. As an older couple we wanted that relaxed but professional day and this is what we got.

The venue is amazedly clean and beautiful with views of the golf course. We was lucky even to get married outside and the outside area is amazing but the staff make this place and your day the best it could be.

We dealt with Kerrie and Jason mainly but everyone we had dealings with were great. Jason ran the day and he was brilliant, I love a bit of banter and he was excellent and even made it fun when I was so nervous 😊 there was also a lady that run the evening (sorry I can’t remember her name) she was also really good making sure everything was ok and stayed until the last guest left. One thing they did do was made sure the bride and groom kept topped up with drinks all day and night again a nice touch, I didn’t visit the bar once 😀

The food was amazing and everyone commenting on how good the food was. We had 9 children and they even did a 3 course for them with milk or lemonade for the toast which was a lovely little touch and made the children part of the day.

The only thing I would have liked would be to have a dressing room on site for the wedding day rather than travelling from elsewhere but that’s my personal view.

Thank you to everyone involved in our day ❤️"
V243,The Darenth,"We got married at this beautiful venue 11.08.23 and cannot recommend enough!! Everyone commented saying how perfect the day was, and every detail was covered by the amazing staff!! Nothing is ever too much to ask - we want to do it all over again!! Massive thanks especially to Jason, Kirsty & Kerry!! My go to people on the day and leading up to the wedding! But every member of staff were just amazing and on the ball with everything. Thank you from a very happy couple 🤍"
V243,The Darenth,I couldn’t recommend this venue enough. From the day we walked into the darenth to view this venue we have always felt so welcomed and wanted. They couldn’t do anymore to help us as they went above and beyond. The venue is absolutely stunning from the outside to the inside 💕 myself and my husband would like the thank each and everyone of the staff here at the darenth no words can explain how much you made our dream become a reality 💕 we shall be booking to come back for our yearly anniversary. Highly recommend this venue*5
V243,The Darenth,"My Wife & I would firstly like to thank Jason for his professionalism, humour, and his skill in dealing with things in real time which put both of us at ease as well as all of our guests.

The catering staff on the day were magnificent and very caring towards us all.

Another plus was the generous of food which all guests appreciated, from the Canopes, Wedding Breakfast & Evening Buffet.

The only issue we did have is that it was agreed that we would have Jallof Rice with the Curry Goat & Fried Fish, but ending up having Rice & Peas with the Curry Goat.

The Jallof Rice being an African dish & Curry Goat being Carribean would have been excellent as we had them at our planning meeting 5 weeks before the Wedding.

The big disappointment was the performance of the in house DJ (Chelmer Discos).

The fact that we could not select our own DJ made us nervous about the music, hence we kept confirming whether the DJ had experience of performing for a mainly Afro Caribbean crowd.

We were advised that this was not an issue, and it turns out according to DJ that he lacks expertise with Afro Beats, Soco & Reggae.

We also asked for the love sign to be displayed as a backdrop in the Ballroom before the Wedding Ceremony commenced which was agreed upon by Chelmer Discos, however it arrived after 19.00.

When we tried to ascertain why the love sign was not delivered at the time agreed, and also, why the music was not mixed as appose to just playing tracks that we emailed to him.

In response we received a rude & threatening email from the in house DJ - Jimmy.

We both loved having our Wedding at The Darenth and all our guests have all commented on how brilliant it was & they loved Jason.

Regards. Mr & Mrs Hutton-Young"
V243,The Darenth,"We celebrated our wedding day at the darenth on Thursday 25th may.
I can not fault our experience at all. From start to finish Jason/Kerry & the team made our day perfect."
V243,The Darenth,Just had my wedding at The Darenth and what an amazing experience it was from start to finish. The staff are all fantastic they made me feel very special on my day. They kept us informed throughout the day with everything that was happening and are all so good at their jobs. The food was amazing and got so many compliments from our guests as did the stunning venue. Special shout out to Jason who was our rock during the day.
V243,The Darenth,"Fabulous venue, immaculately decorated. Kerry, Jason and the team were so kind and professional. I have worked at most venues being a wedding florist, but The Darenth was my choice. We had a beautiful day and they treated my guests like family. I will be recommending them to all my brides"
V244,The Spa Hotel,"We are absolutely overjoyed with how our religious wedding ceremony (Nikah) at the Spa Hotel turned out- truly, it felt like a dream come true. From the moment we began planning, the entire experience exceeded our expectations. Despite the tight timeline of just under four months, Emily Phipps, who I believe is any extremely talented Events and Wedding Coordinator worked tirelessly to bring our vision to life. I had so many ideas, most quite unconventional, but Emily welcomed them with open arms and went above and beyond to make it all happen.

Emily brought so much warmth, dedication, and joy to the table, and thanks to her, our religious ceremony was nothing short of magical. It’s rare to find genuine and skilful individuals in the wedding industry who can truly capture the essence of your dreams and make them a reality, but Emily did just that! We could not have asked for a more perfect day and now four months on, we find ourselves reminiscing over how perfect it was.

To Emily, Tina and Mate, we feel that you have become an extension of our own family! You were not only professional but genuinely caring, your hard work and attention to detail ensured that every moment on the day was flawless. We are so grateful for your contribution to making our wedding feel like a scene from a fairy tale. You are all an asset to The Spa Hotel Events Team!!

For anyone looking to host their special day at the Spa Hotel, we wholeheartedly recommend it. The staff are beyond talented and will treat your celebration with the utmost care and respect. They made our day unforgettable, and we will always be grateful to them for giving us memories that we will cherish forever.

Thank you, Spa Hotel, for making our dreams come true. You will always be a part of our hearts and wedding story."
V244,The Spa Hotel,"When our initial venue unexpectedly closed, we were feeling disheartened; however, we viewed The Spa Hotel and immediately fell in love with its natural beauty, especially its gorgeous Spa Temple. Our coordinator, Emily, was a star and helped us to plan our day to perfection. She was always on hand to answer any queries we had, and she also helped to set up on the day which was very kind of her! We ideally wanted an outdoor ceremony and the weather really came through for us, so we were able to marry surrounded by flowers! The day was an incredible experience from start to finish. David was our wedding coordinator on the day and he went above and beyond to ensure that everything ran smoothly. The team made the process fun and my partner and I were able to enjoy the wedding without any stress or anxiety. Thank you, The Spa Hotel team, for making our day so special."
V244,The Spa Hotel,"We couldn't be happier with our decision to celebrate our marriage at The Spa Hotel.

From beginning to end the service and attention has been incredible. From the moment I arrived to set up our decorations to breakfast in bed and clearing down the room.

We were made to feel special and so were our guests, anything that we needed was delivered.

The suites are beautiful as are the grounds, we felt so lucky to have them as a backdrop to our day.

Our meal was 5*, incredible, we received so many compliments, and food was a big part of the day for us. Delicious!

Thank you, to everyone."
V244,The Spa Hotel,"My husband and I got married and celebrated our wedding reception at the Spa Hotel in December 2023. The day was a dream from start to finish and the team at the Spa did absolutely everything to give us an unforgettable day. Tasha, our wedding coordinated, worked with us from the moment we started planning with the Spa and was available via email and phone regularly to help us work out the details of the day & evening. The setting is beautiful at the Spa, especially at Christmas with all the trees, lights, and decorations. The food was fantastic, everyone commented on how tasty the wedding breakfast & canapes were. The team were so responsive & helpful with the fact that I do not drink, so had all my alternatives to hand all throughout the day. What a perfect place to get married and celebrate our wedding, thank you so much to Tasha and all the team at the Spa Hotel!"
V244,The Spa Hotel,"Beautiful venue, amazing food, the best personable service from the first meeting to the last drink on the day! Thank you so much to Emily and David at the Spa hotel"
V244,The Spa Hotel,"Thank you so much! We had such a great day. For us the best day of our lives so far!

I could not fault the hospitality of you and your staff. If something wasn’t there you guys were straight on it. Nothing was too much to ask. Maty really put our minds at ease. Making sure I didn’t fall down the stairs and having water ready for us when he knew we’d be shaking before starting the ceremony!

It was like a well oiled machine and we didn’t have to lift a finger which took all stress away completely.

A lovely touch was adding the petals in the room and tidying up before we came upstairs. Made us relax so well.

Everyone was so helpful. I’d also like to mention how helpful one of your staff was. I’m not sure of his name, he had red hair. He could see I was panicking in the morning and reassured me by telling me everything was being set up for the ceremony. He was very accommodating and I’m sure he’ll go far in your industry!

Also thank you to Emily. Everything went so well and that’s all down to her coordination. Every staff member knew what needed to be done.

Again thank you so so much!! I’m sure we’ll be back again and of course we will be recommending you guys to everyone we know!!"
V244,The Spa Hotel,"We cannot thank the spa hotel enough, they were so incredible and the whole process made us at ease throughout. Our guests were so impressed at the quality of service, food and drink. We even had guests with sensitive allergies at our day and they had no issues. Everything went perfectly thanks to all the staff.
I couldn’t recommend them more to anyone. So thank you the spa hotel for making our dream wedding."
V244,The Spa Hotel,"We are so happy that we chose to have our wedding day at the Spa Hotel! Right from the beginning, you were so fantastic - fielding questions, keeping us on schedule with jobs and always being a very lovely friendly face to speak to whenever we needed. We so, so appreciate you.

The wedding venue was so beautiful - the photographs have come out so well! The backdrop is absolutely stunning. I’ve just forwarded you our wedding video tease and I’ll send some photos separately. Please feel free to use on any social media.

Your team on the day were great too, so lovely and kind to us."
V244,The Spa Hotel,We got married earlier this summer at The Spa Hotel and it was fabulous. Everybody there is so professional and are experts at what they do. Everybody was so accommodating and helped make our day so incredibly special. The organisation from everybody was amazing (in particular Natasha) and we had the best day. The day went without a hitch and was everything we dreamed of and more. Our guests had a great time and the food was incredible. I can't recommend The Spa Hotel as a wedding venue more!
V244,The Spa Hotel,"After months of planning, discussions and decisions we were finally married at The Spa Hotel, Royal Tunbridge Wells on Saturday.

Thank you to Tasha, David, Jake and the whole team for helping us on the way and delivering a perfect day (despite the weather) with superb and attentive service as well as everything we requested meeting and exceeding our expectations."
V245,Winters Barns,"This was the first venue we visited in person and knew from the moment we walked in the door, walked through the grounds and spoke with the team (Sophie) - this is where we want to get married.

The pre planning process, the correspondence, the queries, the multiple visits - nothing was too much trouble and everything was addressed promptly and in a detailed manner (if it was easier to explain something over the phone rather than email, thats exactly what they would do).

The venue was perfect for guests to explore and roam (& children) but can be contained in a safe surrounding.

On the day, I think it was summed up perfectly by our videographer ""the team are fantastic here, and if anything does go wrong on the day you wont even notice - they are so professional"". We can contest to this - it was perfect!

Thank you Sophie and the Team
x"
V245,Winters Barns,"This venue gives 10/10 for everything. We had looked at four venues before this one. As soon as we walked in we knew it was exactly what we wanted for our winter wedding and the need for onsite accommodation. The service was second to none, we didn’t have to lift a finger on the day and didn’t need to check anything or worry about anything. The caterers were five star, the service was exceptional, all of our guests remarked on the extremely professional service and amazing food. I would give it all 10 out of 10. The band, The Redfords were also superb, in the evening. Sally looked after everything superbly. If you want a magical stress free day that runs like clockwork - book it!"
V245,Winters Barns,"Winters Barns was the perfect setting for our wedding.
We had the most amazing day and could not recommend it highly enough.
Lizzie was absolutely amazing and made the whole process so easy for us.
Everyone was there to help but they were not intrusive at all.
All our guests were blown away by the service and the food - everyone has made great memories.
We have some amazing photos from the grounds and it was so easy having everything all in one place - from getting ready to staying overnight.
Even the set up and taking down was done for us so we didn't have to think about anything - we could just enjoy it all.
I could not have wished for a better venue and they exceeded our expectations by far!"
V245,Winters Barns,"For a venue as busy as Winters Barns, they truly made us feel like the only people getting married, remembering the small details and providing invaluable advice throughout planning and coordination. Getting excited with us during the planning, liaising with our vendors and giving us helpful prompts as we got closer to the day. We never once struggled to get in contact with the venue or get a clear answer on our questions… and there was a few!
On our final meeting where we ran through all the little details, we were met with suggestions and solid guidance which left us feeling confident our dream day was going to come to life as we imagined.
Sally is a SUPERSTAR and our day was run to perfection thanks to her. She pays attention to detail and run us on time to the minute, but she also had lots of fun with it. Popping in to check on us all getting ready always with a big smile and some sound advice and a little time check! Sally put us both as ease as we knew if there was an issue she would resolve it.
Our day at the venue was perfect, from getting ready and building up to the ceremony, it was faultless. The call button in the getting ready spaces is brilliant, this saved the men who were all struggling with their pocket squares and needed super Sally to come and save them!
The accommodation was beautiful and the perfect way to extend the celebrations a bit longer with a recovery breakfast with our families the next morning.
We honestly had the perfect day, as did our guests and have received endless compliments on the venue; the service and everything in between. If we were to relive the day we would not change a single thing.
Thank you so much to the winters barns team and Sally, we couldn’t have done it without you!"
V245,Winters Barns,"Right from the first appointment we knew the venue was gorgeous and it was the one for us! Since booking the staff were always so helpful over emails for any queries whilst I was planning! On the big day we had Lizzie look after us, she is truly the best at what she does!!
I was so set on having an outdoor ceremony but due to weather it had to be inside, however I wasn’t disappointed! It was beautiful inside especially with the fresh new hops (September wedding). Everything went smoothly and we couldn’t have had a better day. We used all the accommodation on site too which was great, clean and comfortable!"
V245,Winters Barns,"Winters Barns is an incredible venue. It has a beautiful rustic charm, from the exposed beams in the bar, wedding breakfast and dance floor areas, to the dried hops hanging from the ceiling. The courtyard is stunning and was well used by our guests well into the evening. The pond with the bridge makes for beautiful pictures and was a huge selling point for us.
The staff were truly amazing. I cannot fault them. They’re incredibly warm and friendly and really do make you feel special. They never once gave the impression they do this every day, rather that yours is the most important day in the world!
We absolutely loved our day - it was truly unforgettable, largely thanks to the brilliant team at Winters Barns."
V245,Winters Barns,"A truly stunning venue! We cannot thank Winters Barns enough for making our day so incredibly special. The staff are so friendly, welcoming and professional, nothing is too much to ask of them and they ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible. We were able to fully enjoy our day knowing everything was being dealt with behind the scenes.
The venue and its grounds are beautiful, the perfect setting for some stunning wedding pictures! The facilities at this venue are amazing from the garden, the barn itself, the salon and pump room to get ready in the morning of the wedding. The accommodation is beautiful and so incredibly clean!
If you’re looking for a barn wedding, I cannot recommend Winters Barns enough! You will not be disappointed! Thank you once again!"
V245,Winters Barns,"We would to thank Sally and her team at Winters Barns for making our special day come to life. This venue is absolutely beautiful allowing for some stunning photos. All our guests commented on its cutsie barn vibes and well maintained grounds.
The food was exactly what we wanted with our 3 course meal and evening food, all delivered with amazing service.
We couldn’t praise or recommend this venue enough!
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
V245,Winters Barns,"Our wedding at Winters Barns was a dream come true. From the moment we arrived, we were captivated by the enchanting atmosphere and timeless charm. The stunning surroundings and well-maintained grounds created the perfect backdrop for our special day.

The staff at Winters Barns went above and beyond to ensure every detail was perfect. Their professionalism and warm hospitality made us feel truly special. From the seamless coordination to the meticulous attention to detail, the entire day ran smoothly, allowing us to relax and fully enjoy each moment.

The ceremony area, with its rustic elegance and intimate setting, created an unforgettable experience. The reception space was equally impressive, with charming decor and a spacious layout that comfortably accommodated our guests. The lighting and ambiance added a touch of romance, making the evening even more magical.

We can’t rate Winters Barns highly enough. It exceeded our expectations in every way, providing us with cherished memories that will last a lifetime. If you’re looking for a wedding venue that combines beauty, elegance, and exceptional service, Winters Barns is the perfect choice."
V245,Winters Barns,"This is a fabulous location with great flexible spaces both indoor and outdoor options.
Sophie and the team were great communicators. Incredibly organised, and took all the stress of the away allowing us to enjoy the best day of our lives. 😍🥂"
V246,Cooling Castle Barn,"Cooling Castle Barn really was our perfect wedding venue. We fell in love instantly and it was the only venue we looked at for our wedding and booked immediately before we even left! The price of the venue and what is included is incredible, it was worth every single penny and we’d highly recommend. Every single staff member we came into contact with couldn’t have helped enough! Out toastmaster (Steve) was absolutely amazing and co-ordinator on the day (Chelsea) was so so helpful with everything that we needed and made sure that everything was sorted and we didn’t have to think of a thing on the day! The getting ready rooms were perfect and the food was absolutely incredible!! We had so many comments about the food and the venue in general from our guests, everyone absolutely loved it!! Thank you so much, we had the most amazing wedding at the most perfect venue x"
V246,Cooling Castle Barn,"From start to finish, the staff were so friendly and professional! Everything was broken down and made so simple, the app was incredible to help keep track of planning. On the day Becky was honestly everything we could have asked for, she kept us updated on everything that was happening whilst we were getting ready and made everything run so smoothly. Would recommend this venue to anyone, we had so many compliments on our choice and had everything we needed under one roof! Topped off by returning to our room with champagne, cake and chocolates. We cannot say thank you enough!! Mr and Mrs Jeeves x"

V247,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We got married on 17 May 2024 and planned a weekend of celebrations with our family and friends, including a 'We tied the knot' cocktail party in the Brasserie on the 18 May 2024. The hotel has a number of quirky and interesting spaces perfect for adding a different feel to parts of your celebration as well as different photo opportunities. It has a trendy and luxurious feel with lots of unique and modern touches. OWP is also a stones throw away from the historic Pantiles which whilst not only beautiful also had a selection of bars, restaurants and boutique shops to entertain our guests during down time. Many of our guests commented it was like being in Europe and again the surrounding areas are perfect for photos.

Not only is the venue beautiful, but the staff and service are absolutely incredible and I do not say this lightly, the service was second to none and everyone was welcoming and friendly creating a true home away from home experience. Karen our Wedding Co-ordinator was amazing and flexible to our different needs. One of the things that attracted us to OWP was our wedding was treated as an individual celebration something we had not found at other venues which had a fairly set itinerary. The food was amazing with a large choice of options, we opted for a deluxe choice menu and it did not disappoint. It was also great value for money which enabled us to carry out our celebrations over a long weekend whilst also focusing on our entertainment and creating the atmosphere we wanted.

If you want a venue that is modern, trendy, flexible and different from the traditional country house wedding then I highly recommend. We have a weekend of memories at One Warwick Park with our nearest and dearest that we will treasure forever and can't wait to return for our anniversary's.

Thank you to the whole One Warwick Park team! Sarah & Sam"
V247,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We had the pleasure of having our wedding at the Warwick Park Hotel, it was an amazing experience for us as a couple and all our guests. Karen our Event coordinator was great with us, she was very receptive to our ideas and did all she can to make it possible even though our wedding was on short notice.

For the actual day, the whole team was excellent, nothing was too much for them.

They went above and beyond for all our guest, one thing that stood out for me was on the day of the wedding the Club room which was the standard complimentary room for the wedding night was used by my wife to get ready in the morning, to avoid us getting back to the same room and enhance our experience on our big day we were upgraded to the Deluxe Room with other complementaries which just made our day perfect. All our bags were moved for us we didn't even need to touch anything which was a really nice touch for us.

Can't say a thank you big enough to Karen and her excellent team, we were chose Warwick on recommendation and we can boldly say we were not disappointed.

And will definitely recommend Warwick Park Hotel to anyone looking for a top of the range service and venue.

Thank you."
V247,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We had an amazing wedding! The venue allowed us to be flexible with our requirements. We had so many lovely comments about the venue, hotel and food. Service and staff were amazing.
The day went to plan and was perfect in every way.
Our wedding meal was lovely. The function room looked beautiful.
Our room, junior suite was spacious and really enjoyed the 3 nights we was there.
Thank you to Karen and all the staff for making our day so special!!"
V247,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We had a lovely day at One Warwick Park for our wedding. Karen was very helpful and stayed the entire wedding day. Finn and Alice are 2 amazing members of staff.
The food was lovely and everything was organised well. Thank you OWP."
V247,One Warwick Park Hotel,"One Warwick Park is utterly amazing for a wedding venue!

I cant thank Karen and every staff member at OWP for making our wedding day perfect.

Karen and I connected via emails and calls in the months leading up to the wedding, the communication was perfect. Everything I ever asked for or things we talked about nothing was never a problem, Karen and the OWP team were brilliant to work with.

The venue is so gorgeous, Modern and Elegant. The Room is bright and large with a gorgeous fire place and open brick wall with wooden beams.
The hotel rooms are so sophisticated and modern. We stayed in ‘The House’ and for Bridal party prep this was the perfect location!!! It was dreamy!!! Spacious, comfy beds, gorgeous kitchen and bathrooms. It was so special to stay with bridesmaids & Family members the night before, but each of us having our own bedroom in a house environment, the House is just amazing!

The food was fabulous!
The chef created some gorgeous dishes for 80 guests, many with dietary requirements, this was no trouble at all and each guests feedback about their meal was that it was all delicious! Thank you chef!!
Our evening buffet – the compliments we received were great here too!. Especially the chicken goujons!
The wedding tasting afternoon OWP hosted to sample wedding day food was amazing. We tried all the wines and dishes, it was so lovely to enjoy this day as a pre wedding day date day. Thank you so much!

I popped into the venue multiple times before the wedding day to visualize and ask various questions that I ever had. Any team member I ever met was so friendly, helpful and kind. Nothing was ever a problem for anyone.

Days before our wedding I sent Karen a photo of some cocktails I liked, Karen worked with the food and beverage manager to bring my idea into reality. I was so happy – thank you so much!

On the day of the wedding Karen you popped in and out, and were there to support me from 7am - I loved it so much the way you kept connected with us, thank you!
My emotions were high throughout the day and this didn’t phase you at all, your support was truly appreciated!

We could not be any more happier with the way our wedding day went. We had such amazing feedback from our guests on how gorgeous the venue and the hotel are. And How good the food was!

Thank you so much for everything Karen. You are great at what you do!!
Enjoy every moment of your own wedding very soon! We are sending you all our love!

Please pass our huge thanks to everyone who worked and helped us during our wedding.
It is so very much appreciated. xxxx"
V247,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We will never be able to thank Karen and the whole One Warwick Park team enough. We would highly recommend this beautiful venue to anyone planning their wedding and are truly grateful for the effort that went into ensuring our day was exactly what we wanted. The food was amazing and we had lots of compliments from the guests on how friendly and polite the bar staff were.
Thank you for helping to make us the happiest we’ve ever felt. We can’t wait to come back and stay for our first wedding anniversary."
V247,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We always knew we wanted a boutique venue to suit our modest budget and the moment we saw OWP we fell in love with its chic and simple interior, perfect for putting our own spin on our special day. Karen and the OWP team were fantastic throughout the wedding planning process. No request was too big/ difficult for Karen and she was so attentive to our wants and needs. We had the most magical Christmas wedding and cannot be happier with how it all turned out! Thank you Karen and team for making our special day perfect!"
V247,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We loved this wedding venue the first time we saw it. We wanted a Christmas wedding and the room with the beams, lights and Christmas tree looked amazing. Planning of the wedding was helped by Karen who gave fantastic recommendations. Nothing was too much trouble. We had the most amazing day. Big thank you."
V247,One Warwick Park Hotel,"Cannot thank Karen and the OWP staff enough for our magical day. From the moment we saw the venue we fell in love and everything was so simple and we wanted for nothing.

The venue has a modern class in an area of Old style beauty. The venue can comfortably hold either a large number or a smaller more intimate celebration and will still look magical."
V247,One Warwick Park Hotel,"Where do I even start….

When we first visited the hotel I knew it would make the perfect venue for our wedding. The function room was perfect, modern, perfect size, the bar was amazing. It just ticked all the boxes.

Karen was absolutely amazing, she was there every step of the way answering all my question and giving advice. She helped us organised our day and help us make an idea on paper turn into the most amazing day.

Before the wedding day we got to attend a wedding menu tasting session was great, every dish we tried was lovely and so happy with our choices everyone at the wedding said how amazing the food was.

On the day the help from all the staff was amazing from welcoming our guests and helping all our suppliers, made me feel so calm as the bride as I knew I didn’t have to worry about anything. From start to finish the wedding was perfect and it wouldn’t have happened without the help of Karen and everyone at the hotel - they turned around the rooms so quickly and the service from the bar staff was perfect.

I couldn’t recommend this venue enough they have everything you need and more for the perfect wedding."
V248,Chapel House Estate,"Chapel House Estate and the team were absolutely amazing! We knew from the first time we saw the venue that it was the one - every single location is beautiful and provides stunning photo opportunities. Every person that we spoke to was so helpful, especially Georgia who was our fabulous on-the-day co-ordinator! We did have a few issues with music during dinner but these were promptly rectified by the staff (with the help of the Head Chef's phone!). The food was absolutely fabulous and I think everyone who came to our wedding was absolutely blown away from start to finish. Thank you so much for making our day everything we dreamed it would be!"
V248,Chapel House Estate,"The most amazing, stunningly beautiful wedding venue, catered for our micro wedding with as much care an attention as a big wedding, Jade our wedding co-ordinator was amazing! The food in the no 9 restaurant was as out of this world! Highly recommend!"
V248,Chapel House Estate,"We cannot recommend Chapel House Estate enough. From the very beginning the team here were so helpful and accommodating.

We’ve been to weddings before that have felt a little disorganised and of course, things can happen out of anyone’s control, however, as soon as booked our wedding here we felt like we were in safe hands. Throughout the entire process, we felt so at ease, and that’s thanks for the team. Georgia and the team worked so hard for us and it really showed. The day ran so smoothly.

The grounds in the venue are truly stunning too and offered the perfect backdrop for our special day. We decided to get married in August as we really loved the orchard and gardens, and to top it off we spent the rest of the day in the beautiful courtyard. We have to mention the food too. We opted for the BBQ option and wow. It was so delicious and all our guests really loved it.

In summary, you won’t regret getting married here. The venue is stunning, the team are fantastic and the food is to die for. Thank you so much Chapel House Estate."
V248,Chapel House Estate,"We had our wedding here in the court yard this last Sunday and all I can say is wow - they exceeded our expectations and more .

Every detail was perfect.
The venue is truly breathtaking and all our guests were blown away by how magical it looked.
The food was exquisite which all our guests have continued to talk about.
We couldn’t have asked for a better day and will continue to visit for our anniversaries.

V248,Chapel House Estate,"We got married at Chapel House Estate in August 2023.

From being shown around the venue by the owner a year earlier, we knew it would be perfect, and indeed, it was!

The grounds are beautifully maintained.

The Chapel House has been finished to an exquisite standard, and the other accommodation on site is great and was loved by our guests.

The whole site was impeccably maintained and as clean as a whistle.

There is ample parking.

The Team went out of their way to accommodate us, with a bespoke menu and served individual alternatives for those with non standard dietary requirements (vegan, veggie and various intolerances!).

The food was of an exceptional standard for over 100 guests and the service was both charming and faultless. It was apparent to us both that the entire team were committed to making our wedding day a resounding success!

In short we were completely blown away by the venue when we first saw it and it overdelivered! What a superb venue!

Special shouts out to Jade, Georgia and the chefs! You are now part of our story!

Would we recommend it?

YES, WE WOULD!"
V248,Chapel House Estate,"If you're dreaming of a wedding that transports you to a faraway destination without leaving the shores of Kent, look no further than Chapel House Estate. This hidden gem is a testament to luxury, elegance, and the promise of an unforgettable wedding experience.

From the moment I stepped onto the grounds, I was whisked away to a Mediterranean haven. The outdoor waiting reception area exuded charm and sophistication, adorned with lush greenery, fragrant blooms, and tasteful decor. The soft rustling of leaves and the gentle breeze lent an air of serenity, setting the perfect tone for the day.

The outdoor wedding setup was nothing short of magical. With sweeping views that seemed to stretch endlessly, it felt as if I was watching the exchanging vows in a private paradise. The attention to detail in the decorations was impeccable, and the natural beauty of the surroundings only enhanced the atmosphere of romance and celebration.

The resort's reception area was a true showstopper. Elegant and opulent, it provided a stunning backdrop for speeches and the main course. The seamless blend of indoor and outdoor spaces allowed us to enjoy the best of both worlds. The expansive glass windows offered uninterrupted views of the picturesque surroundings, while the tasteful interior design added an element of grandeur to the celebration.

The culinary experience was nothing short of extraordinary. The menu showcased a fusion of flavours that left myself raving for more. From delectable appetisers to the exquisite main courses, every dish was a work of art washed down with the very best drop of Rosé. The culinary team's attention to detail and dedication to creating a memorable dining experience was evident in every bite.

The staff at Chapel House Estate were outstanding with a special shout out to Katie for really going above and beyond. Their professionalism, warmth, and attentiveness ensured that every aspect of our special day ran seamlessly. They anticipated my needs before I even realised them, and their genuine smiles and willingness to go above and beyond left a lasting impression on myself and it seemed all guests. A huge kudos to Darren & the force on such an incredible team dynamic.

In conclusion, Chapel House Estate is a true gem in Kent, offering a wedding experience that rivals the most exotic destinations abroad. The combination of breathtaking outdoor spaces, luxurious indoor settings, world-class cuisine, and exceptional service creates a truly unforgettable celebration. If you're seeking a wedding venue that transcends the ordinary, Chapel House Estate is the perfect choice. My heart is filled with gratitude for the memories that were created in this enchanting oasis."
V248,Chapel House Estate,"This venue is first class. All our guests said it was one of the best wedding venues that they have been to. Our day surpassed all of our expectations. The staff made sure the day was seamless. Food was great, service was amazing and the venue is stunning. Would highly recommend to anyone in a heartbeat. Special thank you to Jade and Georgia for ensuring the day was so special. X"
V248,Chapel House Estate,"A few weeks ago my partner and I had the complete pleasure of attending our dear friends’ wedding at Chapel House Estate.
Of course it was lovely to attend and be part of their day. We had heard good things about the venue, but we were taken back with its fabulousness.
Close by to our home in Broadstairs, we felt we had arrived at a far away country estate far further away than we have travelled.
This set the perfect stage for the quintessential and stylish day of celebrations, which continued with partying and fun into the late evening.
The day was faultless.

Having worked in the wedding and events sector both in the UK and the Middle East, I have been lucky to have experienced many events, both as guest and a professional.
The wedding at CHE was up there with the best, from the F&B to the furnishings and staff.
In fact so good it even made me consider getting married again!"
V249,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"The team at Port Lympne were absolutely phenomenal. Months of planning and working with us to ensure our big day would go off without any issues, and it led to a really stress-free day for the both of us, allowing us to fully enjoy our wedding day.

There are far too many things to mention, it’s simply impossible to fully cover the scope of everything they have done for us as part of our wedding.

Guests were raving about pretty much every aspect of the day, and many said it was the best wedding they’d ever been to and probably will ever go to. Quite a few of the vendors made a point of communicating a similar sentiment to us as well!

Comminication is unparalleled, they will do everything they possible can to accommodate any request you may have, and worked tirelessly to provide us with an amazing experience.

We really did get to have a dream wedding, far beyond anything we could have ever imagined.

An immense thank you to everyone, the staff on-site, logistics team, event coordinators, etc… everyone came together to put us first and make the day the most amazing day of our lives."
V249,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Port Lympne is an incredible venue, such a unique and special location for your special day. We had spent our first weekend away as a couple there so it was great to go back 6 years later to get married.
All of our guests loved the venue and the day, and they still talk about the safari and how incredible it was.
Sadly for us, we were let down by the operations team on the day which caused unnecessary stress. The event team were great in the build up, with a few minor issues due to limited flexibility on their end. We also had about 3 different main points of contact due to staff turnover and therefore the package we agreed to and had changed and led to tense discussions. The issues for us arose on the day where the event team handed over the wedding to the operations team who we hadn't met and it seemed to be the first time they had heard of our wedding. Despite handing them a detailed folder explaining how the tables should be laid out, seating plans and all the other essentials, they made numerous mistakes resulting in the wedding party having to fix many of these just before the bride arrived! A few of our suppliers commented how it felt like the venue mustn't have had many weddings due to some of the issues on the day.

However, despite all of these challenges, everything else was magical. The venue spaces are incredible and the food was exceptional. The safari was a real highlight for us and all the guests."
V249,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"We couldn’t have chosen a more magical venue for our wedding than Port Lympne. The setting was absolutely breathtaking—our guests were in awe of the views and the atmosphere - and that was before the wedding started!

The team at Port Lympne went above and beyond to make sure every detail was perfect, allowing us to enjoy every moment without a worry. The pergola and the orangery looked phenomenal in sun!

provided such a charming space for our reception. The food was exceptional, tailored to our tastes, and so many of our guests commented on how delicious it was.

One of the highlights was incorporating the wildlife reserve into our day. After the meal all of our guests got on trucks for a guided safari, which they absolutely loved—it added such a unique and memorable touch to the whole experience.

We couldn’t recommend Port Lympne enough. It was truly the perfect venue, and we’ll cherish the memories of our special day forever."
V249,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Port Lympne is an absolutely stunning venue, from the moment you arrive, you can feel how special and beautiful it is. The pergola has been designed so beautifully, with faux flowers intertwined all around it. It doesn't need any further decorating, it is stunning. What is great about this too is that the staff can put up Perspex glass over the windows if the weather isn't ideal, or can leave the windows open for a nice breeze if the day is good. The orangery is breath taking. As a bride, the worry about making either of these areas look pretty was a job already completed. Easily, the best and most beautiful venue.

The Wedding Team are incredible from start to finish. Nothing is too much trouble, they respond quickly to emails. I felt so cared for throughout the entire process, both myself and my husband were impressed by them. It is more expensive than other venues, but they are worth it. I'd hire them again in a heartbeat. We changed things close to the wedding day, the team easily accommodated, we asked for a different area for the reception drinks (we had to pay for this), but again, the team said yes and adjusted the scheduling in a thoughtful manner so we had more time by the southern terrace.

Food is amazing. We had lots of compliments about this. They catered for a number of vegetarian and vegan guests with ease. The evening buffet was so good. Plenty of good high quality food. I really was impressed.

We had the safari between the meal and evening reception - it was the best. Guests loved it, we loved it.

Honestly the best venue and staff. I want to attend a PL wedding as a guest now!!"
V249,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Looking for a spectacular, unique venue with exceptional customer service? Look no further than Port Lympne! It's hard to find a better wedding venue. From the staff to the views, the facilities to the accommodation, and the food to the animals, everything is outstanding. Every member of staff goes above and beyond to make everyone feel welcome and to provide unforgettable experiences. Words like ""unbelievable,"" ""breathtaking,"" and ""stunning"" were frequently used by our guests, many of whom claimed it was the best wedding they had ever attended.

Special shout-outs go to…

Ceyda: Thank you for being our incredible wedding coordinator. Your responsiveness to countless emails and your dedication to making our big day exactly what we dreamed of were remarkable. Thank you for altering our function sheet so many times without question and for holding my drinks and fluffing my dress when needed!

Charlotte: Your calming presence and willingness to accommodate every request were invaluable. Thank you for keeping me calm in the morning and for your excellent communication throughout the day, ensuring everything ran seamlessly.

Our glorious toastmasters, Jonathan and Nikki: WOW, what a duo! Thank you for ensuring our day ran smoothly and for guiding our guests flawlessly. We (and our guests) loved both of your outfits, especially the park ranger uniforms.

Wedding breakfast serving staff: Your prompt, well-coordinated, and faultless delivery of our food was exceptional.

Evening bar staff: Your constant smiles and enthusiasm, especially joining in with the Macarena, added so much fun to our celebration.

Hotel staff: Thank you for assisting our overnight guests with check-in and ensuring their bags were taken to their rooms, allowing them to celebrate without interruption.

Our wedding at Port Lympne was a dream come true, thanks to the incredible team and the breathtaking venue. We highly recommend it to anyone looking for a truly magical wedding experience."
V249,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Venue
We opted for Port Lympne to start with as we were swept away with the beauty of the venue. It’s truly the most beautiful place we visited. The mansion house is a lovely reception area, the pergola and orangery are private so just your guests get to enjoy this section. The pergola is light and beautiful, and perfect backdrop for a ceremony. It’s really easy to dress up with flowers, as it’s already so beautiful it doesn’t take much.
The orangery is amazing, high ceilings, beautiful greenery & rose bushes surround the area. There’s lovely lawns which you have the option to play garden games on & have photos.
The Moroccan courtyard is perfect for photos, and again doesn’t need any extra dressing or decoration to make it look beautiful - it’s simply stunning everywhere!

The Wedding Team
First the venue sweeps you the way, then the staff do! They are extremely helpful, lovely and attentive. I emailed them a couple of times a week leading up to the big day and they replied within a few hours every time.
On the big day they weren’t overbearing, no request was too much & they were there whenever we needed them.
They do multiple walk throughs with you & introduce you to everyone who is working on your wedding so you know who to ask if there’s any additional requests.

Food & Drink
On the lead up, you get to try the wedding food. They also offer a choice of two for starters mains and desserts (in contrast to other venues we viewed which only allowed for one choice).
The food was incredible, rich and yummy (not dry at all which you sometimes find with wedding food).
The queue for the bar was quick all night (and we had over 100 guests who are all big drinkers). There was no draught beer which we were worried about, but it was fine on the day as this meant everyone was served quickly.
The wine they pair the food with was gorgeous - and again you get to try all this before the big day.
They were accommodating to vegetarians and multiple allergies. This was all planned before hand & we had no issues with this on our day.

Safari
We opted for safari and it was a really magical and memorable touch. All our guests loved it!
You also get to use the buggies the day after the wedding (up to 10am) which is a lovely way to recover from the wedding and a fun way to start your first day of marriage bliss!

There’s nothing more we could have asked for! Perfect for 100-150 guests."
V249,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Port Lympne was an outstanding venue the whole team amazing from the events team to the ground staff always welcoming and helpful up to the day and then the wedding itself.
Safari it’s a great added extra guests totally loved. The mansion house was a perfect venue that sold it for us on our first visit. Outstanding accommodation across the site and food across the day was perfect.
Thank you port lympne team."
V249,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Our October wedding at Port Lympne was stunning - we had our ceremony in the Pergola followed by a reception in The Orangery, and the day ran smoothly. The staff are friendly and accommodating, the venue itself is beautiful with very little additional decorations needed, the safari was a huge talking point and we've been told repeatedly that the food was the best anyone had at a wedding all year. We'd definitely recommend booking your wedding here, you won't regret it."
V249,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Port Lympne as it's no normal wedding venue, it's the Disneyland of Kent wedding venues. We would also like to say a big thank you to Stephanie who worked so hard to make sure the day was perfect. She made our dream weddings come true with Georgina, and Olivia, who handled every aspect of the day so well. All our guests were blown away and had the time of their lives. They keep telling us how perfect the venue was. It really does have it all: 5 star food, the most stunning spaces, water features, coastal views, and breathtaking grounds with animals from across the world (which all our guests got to see as part of our day). If you are looking for a venue that ticks all the boxes Port Lympne and the team can and will make this happen.The team managed everything so professionally, and they made our dream come true! Thank you from the bottom of our hearts."
V249,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"We were married at Port Lympne on the August bank holiday 2023 and would thoroughly recommend the venue.

The Port Lympne team were incredibly helpful and responsive throughout. No question or detail was too much for Stephanie and Annie, who provided an excellent standard of service; they were straightforward to deal with and any concerns or queries were dealt with swiftly.
The wedding day itself ran smoothly and was truly memorable for both us and our guests. The combination of the pergola and the orangery provide for a stunning venue. There are also so many locations for beautiful photos!

A key reason we chose Port Lympne was the high-quality food we had experienced on previous visits to the garden room. For our wedding breakfast, we selected the sea bass with brown crab gnocchi, which was delicious and enjoyed by all guests. There is also an option to select a second/alternative main for those who preferred a non-fish dish.

In the evening we surprised our guests with the safari; it is a must-do and made the day truly memorable and unique.

We also had over 50 guests staying at the venue overnight and Stephanie and Annie efficiently co-ordinated the transport and accommodation elements.

Overall, we had a fantastic day and would highly recommend Port Lympne to couples seeking a unique and special wedding day."
V250,Salomons Estate,"I am so happy my (now) husband and I decided to have our wedding here! Everything about our big day was nothing short of perfect. From the moment we looked at this venue, I know it was everything we wanted.

Our day of coordinator, Leah, was absolutely lovely. Not only is she attentive, but she is kind, thoughtful, and incredibly detail-oriented, making every part of the process seamless and stress-free. I can’t be more grateful to have had her by my side.

The venue decorated for the holidays just days before our wedding, providing us with beautiful added decor and magic! My friends and family love the many rooms and areas to explore, including the museum, gardens, bar, terrace, etc.

We opted for afternoon tea for our wedding breakfast and pizza for late night bites and our guests absolutely loved it! They offered options for our friends with gf, veggie, etc dietary requirements, and people raved about their meals! They have options for everyone.

Between the beautiful venue, genuinely lovely staff, and delicious food and drink, I cannot be more grateful to Leah and everyone at Salomons. I got to live out my fairytale dream wedding here, and I am so excited for every couple who chooses to do the same. You will have the best day of your lives."
V250,Salomons Estate,"The venue is absolutely stunning which our guests also commented on, from the impressive driveway entrance to the beautiful decor inside. We had our ceremony in the Gold Room which had so much detail we did not need to decorate too much further. We then moved through to the Drawing Room for our Wedding Breakfast and Evening Reception. This was the perfect size for our wedding and we were able to decorate the whole area (including the bar and lounge area) creating an inviting atmosphere. The staff are absolutely amazing, from the initial enquiry to the planning to the actual day. The Events team were always on hand to answer any questions or emails and the bar staff on the day were so polite and professional. Even after the wedding, the following day, the staff were still happy and helpful. The food is amazing and so tasty, it was served quickly and hot , allergies were very easily accommodated and the prosecco was lovely. There was nothing that was too much trouble and our Wedding Planner Leah could not do enough to make sure everything went well."
V250,Salomons Estate,"Salomons will now hold a special place in our heart forever. Thankyou so much for everything. Erin our coordinator was incredible and I’m so pleased with her ethics, friendliness and experience. Thankyou!"
V250,Salomons Estate,"We had a summer wedding at Salomons and were lucky enough to have an outdoor ceremony and cocktail hour. It was the perfect place to host our guests (we had 140 guests) and there was a lot of space for everyone to explore, sit and walk around.
We had many compliments about the quality of the food. Our suppliers even said it was the best meal they'd had while working! We did the Sharing Roast and having the guests in chef's hat to carve the roast was a very popular part of our day.
I can't compliment the events team at Salomon's enough. In the last month before the wedding, they were so responsive and went above and beyond. We had a few changes in staff on their side and changed our main coordinator but it had 0 impact to the quality of our day.
On the day, our coordinator Willow was exceptional - keeping the show running and making sure that everyone was well looked after.
We were beyond happy with our wedding and Salomon's will always hold a special place in our heart!"
V250,Salomons Estate,"What can I say, this is a beautiful venue for start. We had Willow as our coordinator and she was beyond perfect! She made sure everything was on point and was excellent with communication! The staff on the day were so helpful and friendly, everyone was raving about them. It was just amazing! I wish we could do it again! Our wedding was three weeks ago, so we are still on cloud 9. The venue catered for all our guests dietaries & were amazing with accommodation!"
V250,Salomons Estate,"Salomons Estate was more than I could have asked for. Erin, our coordinator, was so on top of things throughout the day and so helpful. We had to plan this whole thing from abroad and it was quite stressful but Erin was so calm throughout the process and there were no issues whatsoever. The venue was absolutely beautiful and such a great space for hold events - highly highly recommend! Also, the food was excellent!"
V250,Salomons Estate,"I cannot recommend getting married at Salomons Estate enough.

The whole team are amazing to work with and when first visiting I felt so relaxed and at ease in their company - a lot of other venues felt very pushy in comparison looking back.

We absolutely loved that they had so many options in regards to food and drinks packages. We went for their bbq option which was perfect as we didn’t want a 3 course sit down, we wanted something a bit more relaxed. The food was delicious and everyone said they felt really full compared to some other weddings they’d been to!

The grounds themselves are stunning. We were so fortunate that we got married on the terrace, but the back up room inside was also beautiful if the weather hadn’t been on our side! We had our reception in the science theatre that is such a unique room and so beautiful.

Our wedding parties stayed the night before in the gatehouse and the bridal cottage, most of our wedding party also stayed the evening of the wedding in the hotel accommodation. This really extended our wedding celebration and I’m so grateful we could all stay on site in lovely accommodation.

I could go on and on for hours, but to summarise; the venue is not only stunning but is matched in amazing service."
V250,Salomons Estate,"Salomons was a beautiful location for a wedding! We had a winter wedding and chose it because we liked the indoor setup for our wedding for approximately 100 people, and also wanted on site accommodation. However, the grounds are beautiful and we got lucky with the weather and have had many pretty shots taken outside.

The events team helped us pull together our wedding plan and ensured matters ran smoothly on the day. We had a great time with the tasting in the lead up to our wedding. We also used a number of the recommended suppliers from Salomons and together they put together a truly amazing wedding. Erin helped coordinate our day and also chaueffered us around for our photos as the grounds were a bit wet!

The catering team did a top job on the day. Our guests were raving about how good the food was, and how generous the portions were too! Salomons offered a good selection of wines and their F&B team were flexible to try to source drinks that weren't readily available on the menu. If needed, we were able to supply our own bottles and pay corkage.

My father has some health issues, and the team did everything they could to make his experience on the day as comfortable as possible. I'm really grateful to Salomons for this.

In summary, I'd highly recommend Salomons Estate as a venue for anyone considering a wedding venue in Kent."
V250,Salomons Estate,"We knew instantly when we arrived to view the venue that this was where we wanted to get married. We were made to feel at home, and nothing felt like too much bother. The team were constantly on-hand to answer questions throughout the process, and catered to all of our requests. We had never really thought about an outside wedding, but the South Terrace took our breath away when we saw it in person!
Our wedding day was magical, and ran completely smoothly due to the hard work of the team throughout the day. Our guests commented on the service of the team - there was never a queue at the bar, there was always someone on-hand to help out, and our wedding planner (Fiona) had this magic ability of being everywhere at once! The food was outstanding, and our guests were well-fed and watered during the day. We honestly couldn’t have asked for more from the team!"
V250,Salomons Estate,"We got married at Salomons Estate in June 2023 and it was incredible! We literally have zero negatives to write. Everything from Fiona and her team was brilliant. The care and attention to detail, the day went smoothly and perfect.
All of our guests commented on how delicious the canapés and food were.
We will 10000% be returning for our anniversary.
Thank you everyone at Salomons for ensuring we had the most perfect day."
V251,The Castle Westenhanger,"We had our special day here in April 2024 and all we can say is incredible!

The booking process was easy and so personal, the online planning system was so easy to use and the Westenhanger team were always at the end of an email if we needed anything at all - nothing was too much trouble.
The day went perfectly to plan thanks to the wonderful wedding coordinators, the food was amazing, the DJ was brilliant - genuinely there was nothing we would have changed.

We can’t thank the Westenhanger team enough for everything that they have done in making sure that our wedding day was perfect."
V251,The Castle Westenhanger,"We had an incredible day and are still getting so many compliments from our guests and suppliers on how beautiful the different parts of the castle and its grounds are. It was an unusual wedding (queer Jewish/Christian interfaith), but Jackie, Vicky and co helped to make sure that we had all the things that were important to us, from the vegan food and alcohol-free drinks to the gender neutral toilets to getting the dancing going before the meal had even started. The ceremony room was perfect (and a special thank you to the person who went up on a ladder to put a covering over the boar head that's mounted on the wall!), and we had some amazing photos and videos back from our photographers/videographer highlighting the beauty across the entire venue. We also really appreciate that the company running the venue sent many of the key staff members on trans awareness training so that we could have the most gender-affirming day possible. Thank you Westenhanger team!"
V251,The Castle Westenhanger,"This place is a gem and an absolutely stunning setting for special occasions. We had our daughter’s wedding there in June. The staff were attentive from the moment we first visited to look around, to the time we left having packed up everything the morning after the wedding. The food was delicious and generous portions the drinks were flowing. The castle is authentic and steeped in history which gives it a magical atmosphere."
V251,The Castle Westenhanger,"I can honestly say hand on heart that a typical ‘Wedding’ was not a bit of me. However, there is nothing Typical about Westernhanger.

The magic is created as soon as you walk in and even more so on my day as we had snow!! Transported into a winter wonderland with the most beautiful atmosphere and decorations.

The staff were honestly so incredible and I cannot even begin to thank you for guiding me through my day. You took everything out of my hands and I trusted you all. Your professionalism and expertise ensured that our day ran smoothly. Every single guest commented on how amazing the dinner service was and so professional. Also the food was stunning.

The evening DJ was great and although I took a turn for the worst, due to a sickness bug I couldn’t help but get up and boogie. The evening guests shared that the buffet was incredible.

On behalf of my Husband and I we would like to thank you all for creating and being a part of the most magical day. And if you’re anything like me and do not do ‘Typical’ this is the place for you. Westernhanger will always have a place in our hearts and we’ve made our own history in this incredible historical place."
V251,The Castle Westenhanger,"The team at Westenhanger were so warm and welcoming. We had travelled from up north to come down and looked at multiple venues. The castle was the only venue that we got emotional at. It is gorgeous. We had a huge numbers of friends and family travel down for the day, and many have said it's the best wedding they've ever been to. We did find that perhaps coordination was slightly lax for us, but that could be more of a criticism of ourselves. A really, really lovely team of people. Thank you!"
V251,The Castle Westenhanger,"Tania, Jackie and Bex are an absolutely amazing team. We had such a chill wedding day with everything running smoothly. The Castle grounds are beautiful and looked amazing in the October sunshine. The inside of the castle is perfect for the ceremony and the marquee is great for the reception. We really wanted photos in the dovecote and they turned out lovely."
V251,The Castle Westenhanger,"Westenhanger Castle is an absolutely amazing wedding venue! From the moment we set foot on the grounds, we were blown away by its beauty and historical charm. The staff at Westenhanger Castle couldn't have been more helpful throughout the entire wedding planning process. They went above and beyond to ensure that our special day was perfect in every way.

The team at Westenhanger Castle was incredibly accommodating, helping us with every aspect of our wedding, from selecting the ideal ceremony location to assisting with catering and decorating decisions. Their professionalism and dedication to making our day unforgettable were truly remarkable.

Our guests were also captivated by the beauty of the venue and the warmth of the staff. We received numerous compliments about the exceptional service and the incredible ambiance throughout the day.

In conclusion, Westenhanger Castle is not just a wedding venue; it's a fairytale setting where dreams come true. We couldn't have asked for a better place to start our journey together, and we are immensely grateful for the exceptional support we received from the staff. If you're looking for a wedding venue that combines history, beauty, and exceptional service, Westenhanger Castle is the perfect choice"
V251,The Castle Westenhanger,All the staff from start to Finnish and after are amazing. From enquiries to information and service. Spectacular venue. If you’re looking for honestly care love and so much more. This is the venue. No faults here. Food is wonderful. Would highly recommend!! Zach and jo
V251,The Castle Westenhanger,"From our first meeting, the staff were so welcoming, knowledgeable and responsive to any queries we had throughout the planning process. We had a lot of guests with dietary requirements, so the choice of menus was important to us when choosing a venue. There was a great selection of meals to choice from and the chefs were accommodating where we needed to tweak things!

The venue itself is of course stunning and a real stand out feature is the space for both the bridal party and groomsmen to get ready for the big day! All the staff on the day made sure everything went smoothly and we were able to relax and enjoy the day!"
V251,The Castle Westenhanger,"We cannot recommend The Castle at Westenhanger enough. Quite simply the best. A totally professional team who made our day so special. Everyone and everything was perfect and far exceeded our expectations. On top of this, the team really did make us feel more like friends than customers and really did seem as excited as we were about the day. From day one of planning to clearing up our things the day after, we were met with smiles and hugs and made to feel genuinely special. If you want good old fashioned professional service wrapped in the friendliest of company at a venue that looks stunning, then you have found the perfect venue in Westenhanger."
V252,Lympne Castle,"We couldn't be happier with how our wedding turned out. The venue is just stunning - a beautiful castle, lovely grounds, and overlooking the sea. We had a very small wedding of 15 guests, and we were treated like royalty. We had access to the full castle and spent the day wandering between different sections, enjoying every single one. The food (we had a BBQ) was delicious, and the staff were wonderful. It was all coordinated by Joy who was a pleasure to work with. She spent the day seamlessly coordinating everything behind the scenes, whilst looking after and playing with our dog which was such an appreciated touch! We stayed at the cottages on the castle and they were fantastic. Not only big and full of character, but it also made logistics so much easier having our guests at the location. The new castle bistro (the Naughty Dog) also meant everyone had a place to meet, drink and eat inbetween wedding events.

The best thing about the castle is that it caters for all types of weather. So no matter what you get on the day, you'll still have an incredible experience.

Finals things: the photos you'll get will be outstanding. What a backdrop! And the prices are extremely reasonable. We highly highly recommend this venue."
V252,Lympne Castle,"Great venue, beautiful and so many amazing comments from our guests. The different rooms and spaces made it more and gave the variety we wanted

The team also worked very well to be flexible with last minute changes to make it work and I can’t thank them enough for that

The views are stunning"
V252,Lympne Castle,"So we got married in the church (next door) and hired out one of the rooms in the castle for our reception.

I can’t fault the service. It was spectacular and really made our day special. I don’t think I’ve ever had service like that where the staff are so professional, personable and just amazing all round. We were aware that we didn’t hire out the venue or anything like that specifically for our wedding - it was a room in the castle so we didn’t really expect much. But the staff made us feel like we did. They even roped in some of the gardeners to pull smoke bombs for one of our pictures! The staff made every effort. Laura and Mike were great and went beyond expectations. We just have no complaints at all with anything. It was an amazing day.

The castle itself is picture perfect and for us was the perfect setting. It’s rich in history and the attention to details is incredible. There’s multiple rooms of varying sizes. We had a small wedding so hired out one of the smaller rooms but it looks like they can cater to a wedding of any size. We also stayed in one of the cottages within the castle grounds along with the guests which were equally perfect.

Pretty much every wedding I’ve been to the food has been mediocre at best. But the food here was great. Everybody really enjoyed the food. The kitchen obviously know what they’re doing so kudos to them.

This is honestly the best place to have your wedding. You’re in very safe hands with the staff here, the castle is gorgeous (and the views!) and the we couldn’t think of a better place to do it.

Thank you for the special day!"
V252,Lympne Castle,"Our wedding day was absolutely faultless from start to finish! The wedding team were so helpful and knowledgable throughout the planning process and our coordinator Dan looked after us for our wedding day - thank you Dan!
Lympne Castle is such a beautiful venue, and we can't wait to visit again once the castle bedrooms are ready!
Love, Sarah & Tom"
V252,Lympne Castle,"From start to finish, the staff at Lympne Castle were amazing. Professional, courteous, and incredibly helpful. We planned our own wedding, and although I feared it would become overwhelming, Kate made it so easy for us. The day came off without a hitch and everything was just beautiful, from the venue to the food. I am so grateful to all the wonderful staff, Kate and Mike, Joy, and all the sweet and charming servers. You made our wedding perfect!"
V252,Lympne Castle,"Lympne Castle could not have made our wedding day more special, it was a beautiful and intimate occasion from start to finish. We got to decorate the chairs as we liked and having the rooms to get changed in made it very easy in the end. The food was good and the staff very helpful, especially Mike and Laura. Everything was thought about and all ideas welcomed and accommodated where possible. We had the best day and would repeat it in a heartbeat to soak it all up again. The castle was a little bit of history that made the start of our adventure even more magical. Thank you to everyone at Lympne Castle."
V252,Lympne Castle,"Lympne Castle was truly perfect in every way. The Bridal Suite is stunning and was such a great space to enjoy the morning with my bridal party. We were lucky enough to get married on the lawn outside, the view is unbelievable and our guests were wowed! Our wedding breakfast was held in the Great Hall and genuinely felt like something out of a fairytale. The food throughout the day was amazing and the staff were so attentive and accommodating - especially our wedding coordinator Kate (we can’t thank you enough!!). I’d recommend Lympne Castle in a heart beat and our guests still talk about how magical the venue was - can we do it again please?! Love, Mr & Mrs J"
V252,Lympne Castle,"I could not imagine anywhere else more perfect for a wedding. It was our first and only venue viewing, we fell so in love with it that we booked a date there and then. We loved that our ceremony, reception and accommodation (we used the cottages) were all within the grounds plus the added bonus of the new bridal preparation room. We also had the benefit of Christmas trees and log fires which made our winter wedding particularly festive in the castle setting. The building and views are stunning - our guests were in awe! Aimee, our coordinator was first class in communications, expertise and ensuring the preparations and day ran to schedule. Nothing was too much trouble for her, even helping the grooms party with their buttonholes, a kind and personal touch. The staff were fabulous too and made us all smile with their lovely comments about our celebrations. The brilliant chefs offer an impressive menu, catering for all dietary choices and it is both delicious and beautifully presented. Lympne Castle had everything we could have wished for and more, it is a truly special venue, one of a kind."
V252,Lympne Castle,"Lympne Castle is the most perfect wedding venue. Not only is it absolutely stunning, has roaring fires, beautiful grounds and views but you get the whole venue exclusive which for us was a big bonus!

From the moment we booked it as a venue we were assigned a wedding coordinator - ours was Aimee and she was fantastic! Anything we needed she was super quick to reply and so helpful. We visited the castle lots and went to one of their dinner nights (which I highly recommend.) Our wedding day couldn't have been as smooth as it was if it wasn't for Aimee and her staff they made everything so easy for us and she even held my umbrella and helped me across to the church in the morning.

Everything that the staff do is perfect - the food is superb and the whole venue flows nicely for guests. If you are thinking of getting married here look no further or even for a party - it's a fantastic venue and you won't be disappointed."
V252,Lympne Castle,"well what can I say!! an amazing venue with fantastic staff. From beginning to end we were given so much personal service from everyone at the castle but Aimee was amazing!!! from small little touches around the castle to making me and my now husband feel calm before the big moment...Aimee must have had a Mary Poppins bag as she had everything we needed on hand from sewing kits to mints, scissors and glue and we couldn't have asked for a better day. Thank you for making our day so special ...even to the last touch of a hug goodbye this morning ."
V253,Chafford Park,Amazing venue for our wedding in the summer. Alicia and Sarah worked really hard to make sure we had the best day possible. Both the indoor and outdoor ceremony areas are beautiful and the main barn is a perfect setting for food and dancing. Couldn’t recommend highly enough.
V253,Chafford Park,"Chafford Park is a beautiful hidden gem in the glorious English countryside. From the moment we visited, we felt welcomed and really put at ease by the team and the family. The grounds are stunning, with so many opportunities to explore and capture our favourite moments!
With of having use of the two spacious barns to use we were able to really bring our vision to life, and the day panned out perfectly. The venue hire includes the day before your wedding to set everything up, and we booked to stay in the onsite accommodation in the Long Barn (a must!), which really put my nerves at ease knowing that everything was taken care of before the day.

Sarah and the team were extremely helpful, ensuring we had everything we needed for the day. All of our suppliers went above and beyond, the waiting and bar team were super attentive and great fun!

We had so many of our guests commenting on the venue, the service and the day itself, we just couldn't have asked for more.

We honestly couldn't have imagined our day being any better, we are still on a high from the entire day and cannot recommend this venue highly enough. Thank you so much!!"
V253,Chafford Park,"We knew we wanted to hold our big day at Chafford Park as soon as we first visited the previous spring. We always wanted a venue which was a blank canvas that we could put our own stamp on and it was perfect for this, with the two beautiful barns for us to dress and decorate for the ceremony and wedding breakfast and free reign on our choice of cater, but with a emphasis on trying to keep it local which we liked. The journey for the bridal party from the house to the ceremony barn is beautiful too, passed the pond and through the trees.

As we both work in events we loved having the bell tents as the backdrop for our friends to stay in and having the fire pits and festoon at night time gave the outside area a real festival feel.
It was also a big plus that we could stay on site for two nights - we legally got married on the Friday with a small group of family and friends and then cooked a big meal in the house that night.

Alicia and Sarah were helpful and prompt with any queries in the lead up and we’re very grateful to Charlotte who made sure everything ran smoothly for us on the day itself too.

We hope to return one day for a glamping weekend and to reminisce."
V253,Chafford Park,"We recently celebrated our wedding at Chafford Park, and it was an absolute dream!

The team's dedication to making our wedding unforgettable, from the initial planning stages to the last dance, the staff demonstrated a fabulous level of commitment. They took care of every detail, ensuring that our vision came to life seamlessly.

Our guests couldn't stop raving about the stunning venue. The charm of the barns, coupled with the picturesque surroundings, created a warm and romantic atmosphere that perfectly complemented our day. The natural beauty of Chafford Park added an extra layer of magic to our celebration, making the entire weekend feel like a fairytale. Waking up in the long barn was nothing short of glorious. The tranquillity of the setting and the connection with nature created a serene and peaceful atmosphere. It was the perfect way to start our journey as a married couple.

We loved having the use of two barns one for the ceremony and the other for our reception and the transition from one space to another was seamless, and it made the entire event flow effortlessly. We appreciated the thoughtfulness behind this arrangement, allowing us to savour every moment without any stress.

Our experience at Chafford Park was beyond our wildest dreams. If you're looking for a venue that combines natural beauty, thoughtful design, and a dedicated team, Chafford Park is the perfect choice."
V253,Chafford Park,"Could not recommend Chafford Park more. It is such a beautiful venue and the team are constantly improving and adding extra touches to the venue.

I loved the ability to chose our own caterers - I was able to bring in my African heritage by choosing an African caterer and it really made the day feel unique and special to us.

The sound system is unusual but once you are underneath it, it is great. We worked with a recommend DJ and saxophonist from Mint DJs who were really great and got the party started.

The added touch of having rooms on site for the family really made it easier. We were able to have a lovely family dinner the night before and able to enjoy the farm for the full three days.

Really was our dream day and we are so grateful."
V253,Chafford Park,"Where to start...what a beautiful wedding venue. So picturesque and relaxed. The grounds feel luxurious and private without losing the homely aspects we wanted for our special day. We knew when we looked at Chafford Park that it was the perfect place for our wedding. Sarah, Alicia and Catherine are an excellent team who have an eye for detail and really made sure we were looked after throughout the lead up and on the day. All questions are answered promptly and with care. The landscaped area around the stunning barns provide a perfect backdrop for photos and the barns made the most intimate space for our ceremony and reception. We are so grateful for the time and care to make our day so special. Highly recommend to go and view Chafford park and find out why it is just so special."
V253,Chafford Park,"Even though we had torrential rain on the day, Catie and Sarah made the day flow really well. All staff were incredible and so friendly. The grounds are incredible too. We wanted a laid back wedding with a slight rustic vibe and this delivered! Thank you all, I just wish I could do it all again xx"
V253,Chafford Park,"By far the most beautiful wedding location I have been to. The estate owners and staff were so professional and truly went above and beyond to make my sisters wedding the most special day of her life. Thank you Sarah, Alicia and the team! X"
V253,Chafford Park,"Despite the stunning facade of this venue, its owners and managers are incredibly rude, making planning and having a wedding at Chafford Park an uncomfortable experience.

On our first visit before booking, we loved what the venue offered and how beautiful it was. Sarah the owner was pleasant and kind and we consequently booked a week later.
However after booking, there followed 12 months of terrible communication, pulling back on previous promises made and generally being very uncompromising with our plans.
We didn’t feel Sarah or her daughter Alicia were on our side at any point and felt that they were more concerned about keeping their venue pristine than helping people have a beautiful wedding.

We had such a magical wedding day, despite them. Our guests and vendors contributed to an incredible day and I didn’t feel stressed at all. But behind the scenes, our catering staff and wedding coordinator were having to deal with so much hostility from the managers. They came in, in the middle of service to tell the staff that the kitchen area was too messy!! So incredibly rude and completely unprofessional. And this was only one incident amongst many that I heard post wedding where they were rude and disrespectful towards vendors and guests alike.

You are also obliged to partner with Wild Box to serve the drinks when you book this venue - they work closely with Chafford Park so essentially are almost as hostile. There are many things that you can’t do - put up your own decorations, bring your own alcohol or have a campfire past midnight. We luckily found our way around all of this but they made the whole thing so difficult and uncomfortable.

I would encourage anyone to not be lured in by the beautiful surroundings and look elsewhere if you want a more friendly and compromising service."
V253,Chafford Park,"We had the most amazing wedding at Chafford Park! It really is the most stunning venue, especially in June when everything is in full bloom. We really wanted as many of our friends to be able to stay with us across the whole weekend and this venue offered just that. The Glamping tents were a huge hit with our guests and the long barn where we stayed was beautiful (and perfect for getting all the girls glammed up on the big day!) Being able to access the venue from Friday morning until Sunday midday meant we could fully enjoy time with firends and family who had travelled so far to be with us.

Alicia and Sarah were so helpful, making sure everything was just as we wanted it and that the day ran smoothly. We couldn’t have pictured a more perfect place for our wedding and can’t wait to return for some more glamping in the years to come!"
V254,The Ferry House,"Where do we start with this review? Well, if you are looking for a venue that has practically everything this is it. The staff are fantastic, they were brilliant from the day we booked it and even after the event. They were helpful all the way through the journey and on the day the staff we great. Our guests had the most amazing time and all said it was one of the best weddings they had been too. Granted the weather helped, but a mild sunny day in April made it perfect. The food was 10 out of 10, really do recommend the upgrade on the menu choices and wine. The in house DJ was also excellent. In fact everything went to plan, there was nothing negative just the perfect magical day."
V254,The Ferry House,"We got married at the Ferry House last Saturday and had the most amazing magical day and that was all down to the incredible team at The Ferry House.
Sam & Chloe were our wedding coordinators on the day and they were absolutely faultless, the day ran perfectly and that was all down to them both.
The food was incredible and every one of our guests commented on how amazing the food quality was.
The rooms were super comfortable.
The venue overall was just incredible, we would highly recommend anyone getting married to celebrate here.
Thank you all"
V254,The Ferry House,"This venue is a hidden gem, we didn't know about it until we were looking at Venues and we instantly knew this was the place for us. Relaxed, rustic, caring and everything in one place! The venue itself is so warm and inviting with the log burning fires, rustic bar, barn and amazing surroundings. The team go above and beyond to make your day extra special.
The food selection is amazing, we had the hog roast which everyone commented on!
Thank you to everyone at The Ferry House, our day was amazing!"
V254,The Ferry House,"Our winter wedding at The Ferry House was just perfect, and that is all thanks to the amazing team. The care and attention to detail they had to understanding our vibe and making our vision come to life was just second to none. We have so many amazing memories of the day and also the planning stages. The setting was beautiful, the food and drink were amazing, and the staff were all super friendly.
All of our guests loved everything about the day and are still talking about it now.
Thank you so much for making our wedding dreams come true, core memory made!"
V254,The Ferry House,"Our special day tailored to our exact requirements, staff professional from original viewing to the day, cannot thank them enough, what they always say about a good place is the staff make the venue, and they sure do at the ferry house. Beautiful venue in picturesque surroundings worth every penny"
V254,The Ferry House,"The Ferry house is an absolutely amazing , our wedding day was magical .
Our guests all said what a beautiful venue .
The food is outstanding and all the staff are very helpful. From the first planning meeting up to the day of the wedding .
Nothing was to much trouble if I had a query they was always at the end of email .
Myself and the bridal party stayed at the cottages the night before , this really added to the excitement of our wedding day .
The rooms at the Ferry house are decorated to a high standard and are very comfortable. The food is amazing.
We would highly recommend this venue . Our wedding day was perfect ."
V254,The Ferry House,"I don’t even know where to start - the Ferry House was the perfect venue for our big day. Nothing was too much trouble and they made the whole planning process so easy. I have worked at weddings myself and know how venues can sometimes be difficult and reluctant to help with certain things but not the Ferry House!
They decorated the venue with my diy decorations without any issues, they answered my constant emails (crazy quickly!) and even put up with me doing everything last minute!
The actual day itself, they were so helpful, excited for us and just made us feel amazing!
The venue is just absolutely gorgeous - nearly every guest came up to us on the day to tell us how amazing it was and they honestly felt it was the best wedding they had been to! All thanks to the Ferry House. If we could do it all again we would both choose the ferry house again in an instant."
V254,The Ferry House,"We just wanted to say a huge thank you to the whole Ferry House team for all of their hard work, support, kindness and helpfulness in making our day so incredibly perfect. Our guests were so amazed, and keep telling us as much!

It wouldn't have been as wonderful without the team all part of it, and Josh was the best DJ! He played some absolute tunes. Owen took great care of everyone down by the firepit.

Chef and his team put out some absolutely incredible food, everyone has been raving about it since. The food was simply perfect, we're having roast dinner withdrawals at this point....

Katy took care of me and pampered me for six months in the run up to the wedding with the facials, definitely one of the best parts of wedding planning, she got rid of any worries in each session, I will definitely be continuing with those, I miss her already! They should be a must for every bride to be!

Maxine & Georgina, where can we start? They were both the most organised, reassuring, fantastic team, they were truly perfect, being the calming voices of reason, and helping move everything indoors in the morning.

We would write an essay about how amazing each and every one of the Ferry House team are. Every single one of the Ferry House team are truly one in a million, and TFH are very lucky to have them all."
V254,The Ferry House,"Our son has just been married at The ferry house.
From start to finish the staff and wedding team have been incredible!
The attention to detail, care and kindness of all the staff is the best we have ever received. They were simply amazing.
The venue itself, is totally worth the journey .
It was absolutely stunning and took our breath away when we saw it decorated.
We stayed overnight and the rooms were beautiful, clean and really comfortable.
Our buffet breakfast in the morning was delicious, full of fresh produce.
The food did not disappoint, it was the best wedding breakfast meal we have had.
Congratulations on a top star venue and a brilliant team of staff from the washing up lady to the wedding planners (Maxine was especially brilliant and also our assigned host who never stopped smiling despite our requests for this and that).
Thank you one and all for making Harry & Dan’s day totally amazing! We couldn’t have asked for more ."
V254,The Ferry House,"The best team of people you could ask for! Every single person we spoke with was so helpful and lovely to deal with. They made our day so special and run seamlessly! We couldn’t have asked for a better team!
The food and drink is the best around, locally sourced making it all taste so much better! And the views, away from everything so you can really soak in the day with your loved ones with no distractions!
Couldn’t ask for more"
V255,Hayne House,"I fell in love with Hayne House the second we went to our viewing and it only got better from there.
The pre-wedding process with the team at Hayne House was amazing, they were so accommodating and responsive and had answers to all the question that my Type A Bride brain threw at them. Throughout the planning process they were fabulous and it was so nice to find a venue where we could both get ready on site in the morning.
On the day, the Hayne House team (Beth) were absolutely fabulous. Beth kept me calm all morning and made me feel like we were in safe hands. We DIY-ed all our decor and Beth asked my input on the set up before the Groom turned up which really put me at ease. Beth also managed our ceremony music on a phone and it just made me feel so comfortable. Pre-aisle walk, Beth really helped me understand what would happen and really set my nerves at ease. The whole team were incredible and they made our day so so perfect.
We couldn't have asked for more. The venue is stunning and the team are amazing! I would recommend Hayne House to absolutely anyone! We also really loved the sustainability initiative, as we're both conscious of that, and that's what initially made us look at Hayne House. 100000% would recommend!"
V255,Hayne House,"We were married at Hayne House in August 2024, it was one of only 2 venues we selected to view at relatively short notice (we decided to give ourselves only 6 months planning time and were lucky they had availability for our chosen weekend!) - Sam was the first person we met and so welcoming. She really helped us imagine, in the cold of winter, how our summer wedding could be. We absolutely fell in love with the orangery from seeing the photos, but the reality was even better. Our key criteria was a venue that felt like a summer garden party, and you really got a sense of the lovely grounds by being able to see out to them all around you, even from inside the venue.
Becky gave us some great guidance throughout the planning, and Ella and team made the day run very smoothly.
6 months later, our guests are still talking about the beautiful relaxing day - it was everything we imagined - and better!"
V255,Hayne House,"Safe for the children to run around already beautiful so don't need to much decoration, staff couldn't of done any more on the day to help."
V255,Hayne House,"Hayne House was absolutely perfect.
The wedding Co ordinator Ella was so professional. She kept everyone calm and organised throughout the day. Would highly reccomend Hayne House as a wedding venue everything was fantastic!"
V255,Hayne House,"Hayne House was just the most perfect setting for our wedding. It’s private and beautiful surroundings coupled with amazing staff, food and suppliers - we couldn’t have asked for more or had a better day."
V255,Hayne House,We couldn’t have asked for a more superb venue and team! They made sure we had everything we needed on the day and we’re just so kind and helpful leading up to the wedding. They answered all our queries super quickly and the whole day just felt like a breeze!
V255,Hayne House,Hayne House is a beautiful wedding venue with a amazing team of staff! They supported us every step of the way and made sure everything ran smoothly on the day. They go above and beyond to make sure everything is perfect. I would especially recommend Hayne House if you have children as they are free to play the entire day! We had so many comments from guests about how beautiful the venue is and how amazing the staff are.
V255,Hayne House,"The team have curated a flawless operation at Hayne House which is so clear. The team ensured the day ran seamlessly and were amazing throughout the day and also during the lead up to our wedding which made it so stress-free and easy for us! There was not one thing that we needed to worry about on the day, the team handled EVERYTHING!! We had the best day and we're so pleased we chose Hayne House for our wedding, it was perfect!"
V255,Hayne House,"Had our wedding at Hayne House in June 2023- cannot fault a single thing with the team, services or facilities. Am so glad we chose Hayne House and would recommend to anyone wanting to get married stress free with a fantastic team who truly take the pressure off of wedding planning and are extremely flexible with requests and adjustments. Very good value for money and honestly all expectations were exceeded! Everything was well thought of and planned, there were no surprises and communication was excellent from the moment we made initial contact. Was such a special and memorable day due to the efforts and high quality of care and services at Hayne House."
V255,Hayne House,"As soon as we saw Hayne House we knew it was the perfect venue. The team are so welcoming and lovely. To the lead up to the big day they helped with everything. On the big day they may us feel at ease. I cannot recommend this venue enough, all of our guests said what a beautiful venue it is. They made our day so special, we enjoyed every little bit of it, thank you to all the team!"
V256,Bradbourne House,"My son had his wedding at Bradbourne House, the venue was beautiful, the staff were so helpful from start to finish, food was absolutely amazing, the toastmaster was a credit to the venue making this a day him and his new wife will never forget I would thoroughly recommend Bradbourne House for a wedding venue."
V256,Bradbourne House,"We had our reception here from the moment we arrived we were looked after and our guests were well informed. Hannah was fantastic and made our evening run smoothly and nothing was too much for her, she even helped me with my dress before my first dance and always asked if I was okay. Lauren was our first point of contact and she is lovely as is Rebecca. Thank you all so much. I would definitely recommend Bradbourne house not just for its beauty and privacy but for its team too."
V256,Bradbourne House,"On Saturday 27th October 2018 Julie and I had our renewal of Vows celebration at Bradbourne house, from our initial contact with Lauren at the Wedding Fair to the tasting menu to the day itself was a professional and dedicated service.

Bradbourne House has understood our requirements and ensured that the delivery of these were met without fuss or bother.

The food delivered from the Head Chef from Canapes to Wedding Breakfast to the Hog roast in the evening was first class.

The day itself ran like clockwork and the staff were again professional in their duties to ensure that all our guests were looked after.

It was a 5 star experience and we are already booking for our milestone birthdays in the next year or so.

A special thanks to Lauren and Head Chef who went beyond the call of duty to make it that special."
V256,Bradbourne House,"To all the fabulous staff and Bradbourne House, thank you so very much for your wonderful wedding organisation, wine knowledge, kitchen and food skills and ability to put on a great day as a team. You are all fantastic and a real asset to your employers. We are so very glad that we chose you as our venue. A no hassle and pleasant experience from start to finish. Wonderful! Thank you!"
V256,Bradbourne House,"From start to finish, Bradbourne House was wonderful in delivering the most perfect wedding reception for us. The house and gardens are absolutely beautiful and give you a great amount of space. What really made it was the staff. Everyone from the events team who worked with us for months beforehand, to the fantastic team on the day who thought of everything we hadn't and were there whenever we needed them. It meant we were free to enjoy the company of our guests and not worry about a thing. Perfect day and can't recommend it enough for a dream wedding venue."
V256,Bradbourne House,"To all at Bradbourne House.

Just a big thank you for making the Wedding of Paul and David such a memorable day. The venue was delightful and everything you did made it the most wonderful occasion. Everyone said it was the best wedding they had ever attended! The weather, the setting, the staff and the food was absolutely perfect.

So as the mother of Paul i thank you so much for a day to remember, it was absolutely flawless.
Thank you all again."
V256,Bradbourne House,Just a little note to say a big thank you for making our day run so smoothly. It all went perfectly for us and everybody was so complimentary of Bradbourne House.
V256,Bradbourne House,"To all at Bradbourne... thanks so much for making it a super special day for me and Emma. Your whole team was superb, especially Charlotte, and made the day very easy for us. We had so many nice comments from guests about the venue, the food and the staff. A few pics as requested!"
V256,Bradbourne House,"We just wanted to say a massive thank you to all of you and the fantastic team that helped make the day special!
The staff and service were all exceptional and nearly all the guests commented on the high standard of service and professionalism of your team. Food... Amazing!!

Thank you all so much. You took the pressure off before and during the wedding and delivered to us a day that no one will forget for a long time to come."
V256,Bradbourne House,"I attended Bradbourne House on Saturday 18th June for my cousin wedding.

I am unable to eat wheat/gluten so passed this on to the bride and groom beforehand.

I am just getting in touch to say how great your staff were at facilitating my needs! The food was delicious and they made sure it was gluten free for me. In the evening fish and chips and bacon sandwiches were being served. I was unable to have the fish as covered in wheat but a very kind gentleman brought me out two bacon sandwiches in gluten free rolls. This was very much appreciated. I was also advised the chips were gluten free!

Thank you for being so accommodating. It is much appreciated!"
V257,Westerham Golf Club,"We cannot express how grateful and happy we were with Westerham Golf Club. All of the staff were amazing and our event managers made sure we were always kept up to date and incredibly quick to reply (even though we bombarded them with our silly questions!) They made us feel so at ease and took care of all the little details they we didn't even think of! The food was delicious and they ensured that everyone was catered for. If you want a beautiful, seamless wedding experience, Westerham Golf Club is the place to book!"
V257,Westerham Golf Club,"Everything about this venue was just perfect. From our first visit up until our wedding date, the team at Westerham were so helpful and always on hand to answer any questions. On the day, the team had everything under control and the whole day went smoothly - not to mention the incredible views!"
V257,Westerham Golf Club,"We honestly cannot recommend Westerham Golf Club enough as a wedding venue! From the moment we first reached out to inquire, the team made everything so easy and stress-free. The events manager and the coordinating team were absolute professionals, and they went above and beyond to ensure that our big day was flawless.

Everything about the day was incredibly well-organised. From the ceremony to the reception, everything flowed so seamlessly. We didn’t have to worry about a single thing as the team had every detail covered. It was amazing to be able to relax and enjoy the moment, knowing that the entire team had everything under control.

The venue itself is absolutely stunning, with beautiful views and a warm, welcoming atmosphere. The level of care and attention the staff gave us was exceptional. The events manager was always there to offer support and guidance, and they were just so kind and approachable. The entire team worked in perfect harmony, and their professionalism shone through at every step.

Our guests had an unforgettable time, and I’m so grateful to the team at Westerham Golf Club for making our wedding day so memorable. If you’re looking for a wedding venue that offers top-tier service, incredible organisation, and a beautiful setting, Westerham Golf Club is the perfect choice!"
V257,Westerham Golf Club,"We visited many venues before deciding on Westerham. What stood out right away was how lovely and welcoming the staff were on that initial visit, they really made us feel like no question was too silly to ask. And of course the setting - we initially wanted an outdoors wedding but knew that there'd be the risk of bad weather, so it was important any outdoor venue would have a great indoor backup. With Westerham, you can't have an outdoor wedding, but the indoor setting, with wide open windows revealing the beautiful landscaped golf course in all directions, meant it was like an outdoor wedding anyway. And it was just as well because on the actual wedding day, there were quite high winds! The team there were so helpful and patient throughout the whole year of planning, and on the day itself. They really put our minds at ease and were really flexible with some of our requests. The reception rooms are great - the smaller one for the ceremony was just the perfect size for our 100 guests, and the larger room for the wedding breakfast and evening celebration was spacious with room to eat, to dance, and to sit to catch your breath. The golf course is a wonderful setting to go out and get your formal photos and some video shot. It's fun to take some of the golf carts up into the wooded area and a chance to have some private moments with your new spouse. It's such a beautiful setting, we would recommend if you can afford it to include some drone footage, for your wedding video because it allows such a great view of the course, the buildings and water features. The food was excellent, in particular the lamb shank, and such huge portions that we struggled to eat a lot later in the evening at the buffet supper. Well worth paying the small extra supplement to allow 2 menu choices plus a veggie/vegan option. They also managed a few tricky dietary requirements really well including Halal and some fairly unique food allergies. Our formal proceedings were capped off by a fireworks display out on the golf course which made for some amazing pictures and video and if you can afford it, we would recommend it. Many guests said it was their favourite part of the evening and a real surprise. We couldn't be happier with our decision to be married here and it's hard now to imagine us getting married at any of the other venues we looked at. You will have a wonderful day no matter what time of year or whatever your theme."
V257,Westerham Golf Club,Amazing staff and amazing place. Loved every minute of my big day. They put in all the effort in to your big day. They made sure the day was perfect
V257,Westerham Golf Club,"Amazing experience from start to finish!
Fell in love with the venue the day we went and viewed it! It was all we imagined!
Gracie was Amazing the whole way through until the big day for us!
I honestly wish I could relive the day!

The day from start to finish is all we ever dreamed off! And I couldn’t recommend this venue enough and the team!"
V257,Westerham Golf Club,"When we began our wedding venue search, our main criteria were:

- good proximity to airport for international guests
- ceremony and reception at the same place, without the need to exit / reset
- no preferred supplier limitations
- kitchen on site (no need to hire externally)
- natural materials, like wood and brick, barn aesthetic
- indoor space we'd be happy not to leave in bad weather
- can have live music with no formal noise limiter
- experienced & supportive team
- budget

Westerham Golf Club delivered all of this and so much more. As soon as we visited the venue for the first time and spoke to the team we were confident we found our venue.

We were assigned a contact person straight away who answered all of our questions by email and phone conversations and was always unbelievably helpful and quick to respond.

In the lead up to the day we met our wedding day coordinators who we were reassured were very on the ball. We had a lot of personal details and touches throughout the day and never felt that we had to remind any of the team about them, they all understood the vision and knew all the intricate details of the day. They delivered them all without fault.

The venue on the day looked absolutely stunning. The exposed brick and beams in the Valence Suite make this feel like a cozy but expansive barn conversion, but with the benefit of the adjoining rooms, wrap around balcony and excellent facilities of the golf club. The views are spectacular and the tree-lined drive up to the venue really sets a great tone.

Throughout the day everything ran like clockwork, guests commented that the food was incredible and all of our suppliers worked with ease with the staff and facilities.

The team set up all our personal and homemade things for us and packed them all away again for easy collection the next morning - we are so so grateful for this!

The flow of the space is fantastic, we had our ceremony in the Eleanor Suite, then did confetti outside before re-entering the main space where the drinks reception were laid out and musicians performing. The bar area, sofas, dance floor and balcony were perfect for the canapes and drinks reception. We had photos on the grounds as well as in the lovely rose garden at the front of the venue. The dinner set up was there from the morning and had a real wow factor when guests first saw it. While Eleanor Suite was empty the chairs were quickly cleared and this became a breakout space where we laid out board games and guests could relax if they didn't want to be dancing with the band.

We got married in November and had a lot of evening guests, so having a space with plenty of room, without anyone needing to go outside (in case of cold/rain) was key and the venue was perfect in this regard. In the end we had a lovely clear day and guests really enjoyed being on the balcony.

I hope this review is helpful in helping other couples choose their venue. For us it was a dream come true and we cannot thank the team enough for delivering a perfect day!"
V257,Westerham Golf Club,"The lead up the wedding was great, Ella helped us with any little questions and made sure everything was sorted!

The day before we met the on the day manager Brad who talked us through the whole day and made sure we were happy with everything. Also when we walked in one of our suppliers hadn’t done what they were meant to - and the venue got on the phone to them right away to come back and sort it meaning the stress was off me!

The day came and it was a blur, but everything went smoothly, my guests couldn’t stop complimenting the venue and how gorgeous it was. Every detail was perfect and the food was amazing! The wine choices were a big hit and I couldn’t be more complimentary of the staff.

The only hiccup we had was when asking for a cup of tea for my Nan during the welcome drinks, and my brother was told they can’t do that by the bar, but my groom went up and it was sorted quickly.

Thanks westerham for a memorable day - that we will cherish always"
V257,Westerham Golf Club,"Westerham is a beautiful venue. The backdrop of the luscious green golf course and the building itself is amazing. The rose garden is the perfect place for a drinks reception - even the drive into the venue is cool!

Now to come onto the staff. Every single one of them couldn’t do enough for us. The communication at every step was faultless, and they are extremely helpful regardless of who you deal with! They are professional and can accommodate a whole variety of things, for example we asked for halal meat and they sourced it without any issue, no extra costs or anything. Their recommended suppliers are great, and they really make you feel at ease throughout the whole process and on the day.

The food is also VERY good. All of our guests were complimentary of that, as well as the decoration and table layout which is rustic and picturesque.

Having the licensed ceremony room in the same venue was perfect, as your guests can simply walk through the door into the wedding breakfast and evening reception room! The bar is well stocked, the wine selection was well received by our guests too.

We really can’t recommend Westerham enough. A few of my friends who were there are now considering it for their wedding venue, it’s that good and I found beat all others on price too!"
V257,Westerham Golf Club,"We made the best decision choosing Westerham Golf Club for our wedding venue. The staff went above and beyond, there are so many photo opportunities on the immaculately kept grounds, and the food was stunning! We had so many compliments from guests on what a fantastic venue we had chosen. The team made the whole wedding planning experience really straight forward, and were always in hand to answer any questions we had. Couldn’t recommend Westerham Golf Club enough!"
V258,The Old Kent Barn,"I could not be happier than we chose to have our wedding at The Old Kent Barn. The care and attention to detail the entire team put into everything they do is unmatched. The venue is absolutely stunning, and so many of our guests commented on how incredible it was. The food was amazing - so filling, tasted amazing and looked just as good. We had Sam as our wedding coordinator and she went above and beyond to ensure we had the best day of our lives. I'm so grateful that we found this venue - as it provided us with the most unforgettable day. Thank you TOKB!"
V258,The Old Kent Barn,"We had our wedding at The Old Kent Barn and couldn’t be happier with our experience. Everything was incredibly well planned and organised from start to finish. The staff were professional, attentive, and genuinely cared about making our day perfect. The venue itself is stunning, with beautiful grounds and a warm, welcoming atmosphere. It made for the most amazing setting for our ceremony and reception. We felt completely supported throughout the planning process and on the day itself. Highly recommend to any couple looking for a seamless and unforgettable wedding experience."
V258,The Old Kent Barn,"We would just like to give a huge heart felt thank you to all of the team at The Old Kent Barn.

We had our special day on a sun filled day on 3rd January 2025 surrounded by all our family and loved ones.
Our wedding was brought forward with 6 months due to doctors advice to my wife.

They couldn’t of been more helpful. Helped us through every step of the way and guided us through the entire process.

This was an absolute god send to my wife who is regularly in and out of Kings College Hospital.
The team took all the stress and worry from us and were always on hand in with any questions.
They were absolutely awesome. They are extremely well organised and ensured everything went well.

Our fairy tale wedding became a reality and we owe this to all the team.

We’d like to give an extra special shout out to Chloe, our wedding co-ordinator. You were awesome!
If anyone is looking for a venue for their special day then look no further than The Old Kent Barn.

You made our fairy tale wedding a reality and we’ll be forever grateful to you all."
V258,The Old Kent Barn,Myself and my husband married at the stunning Old Kent Barn in October and had the best day of our lives. The staff were amazing throughout the whole process from securing a date all the way to end day after the big day. Our wedding coordinator in particular Claire was just amazing and so helpful and resourceful. We would highly recommend the venue to anyone!
V258,The Old Kent Barn,"We got married at TOKB and it was flawless from the very first moment we’ve signed to the wedding day itself.

The whole process was very smooth and they have thought about every little detail. Their portal is very comprehensive and they help you to plan your wedding and make sure you cover every aspect of your day.

They really do go above and beyond and they run the wedding almost military style (in a good way!). They make sure you are on track without being pushy. Everything is done seamlessly and in the background. You never know they are there!

The venue is fantastic and there’s very little you need to do to decorate. It’s just down to individual themes and table decorations. It allows you to take great photos as the venue and the gardens are beautiful.

The food was great. The portions were massive and it tasted great. You won’t be leaving the wedding being hungry.

All in all, they have thought about everything, including the tiniest details. Even at the end of the night, the have made sure that there was some evening food left for us in our bedroom.

We’ve had a great wedding at TOKB and we are very grateful to the venue and the staff for making it perfect."
V258,The Old Kent Barn,"I would recommend TOKB to every single couple out there! They are more than just a venue - the staff here cater to you as if you are family, and gave us the wedding day of our dreams! Each staff member goes above and beyond to ensure your day is perfect, and you get a wedding coordinator who basically ensures everything on the day goes smoothly. They took all the burden of the stress so my partner and I could just be present and enjoy our day. I’m so glad we chose the Old Kent Barn, as my partner and I know not every venue is as thorough and caring as them (from stories from our friends and family about their weddings). Thank you TOKB - we love you!!"
V258,The Old Kent Barn,We chose TOKB as our wedding venue and never once regretted our decision. They have been incredibly supportive through our plethora of questions and thoroughly looked after us from enquiry and beyond the big day. Every single member of staff works extremely hard - from grounds keepers to kitchen staff to bar staff to wedding coordinators - you name it! Nothing is too much trouble for anyone there as they purely want you to have the most special experience with them. I cannot recommend them enough!
V258,The Old Kent Barn,"The Old Kent Barn was the most perfect venue! From the moment my now husband and I went for our first viewing right through until after the wedding the staff at the venue have been amazing - Ashleigh was our wedding coordinator and could not have been more helpful and on the day she was an absolute star and went well beyond her role in helping do things to ensure the day ran smoothly. The venue is STUNNING and the staff set everything up for you so that you can have the most relaxed wedding morning! Our guests could not speak more highly of the food - it was delicious and the chefs team were really accommodating with special requests and dietary needs and allergies etc! My husband and I had the most special wedding day and I highly recommend The Old Kent Barn, you will not regret choosing this as your wedding venue!"
V258,The Old Kent Barn,"We got married at the Old Kent Barn this week. From the minute we first enquired, to the tour, booking, planning, and wedding day were all perfect and so well organized. The staff all go above and beyond and we could not have been any happier. They make the planning process so easy, and we're always there is we needed assistance. The venue is gorgeous, so well maintained, the gardens especially are always being worked on and are gorgeous, we especially loved the pond and ducks!! I would not have changed a thing. The food was brilliant we went for a BBQ and had SO many compliments from our guests, the canapes, deserts and evening food were all amazing as well. Thank you so much for making our day perfect."
V258,The Old Kent Barn,"A week on from our wedding and I’ve come to the conclusion that there are no sufficient words to describe our experience at the barn.
From the minute we booked, the team have been brilliant. They are so responsive, they never leave you waiting for an answer when you email. They are positive, supportive and, most importantly, kind!

I have listened to the podcast ‘The Unfiltered Bride’ for most of the wedding planning and they encourage booking a ‘day of’ coordinator as wedding venues don’t provide the support you need. I can promise, with all my heart, you do not need one at TOKB. I had worried that we’d made a mistake not booking one, but boy did they prove me wrong.
They had at least two people checking on us throughout the morning as well as someone else for my husband, who helped with ties and getting them ready. Yes they were there to coordinate everything from the venue POV, but I did not feel ignored or that I was missing an extra person to help. They were on hand to help get me into my dress, to make sure my bridesmaids were ready. If you listen specifically to episode 74 of ‘The Unfiltered Bride’, everything listed during that episode as something a ‘day of’ coordinator does, is everything the team at TOKB did.

The food at TOKB is sublime. We had the hog roast for wedding breakfast and pizza for the evening. Our guests loved everything about it all, including the canapés. They took all dietary requirements we had in their stride and no-one went hungry.

I could gush about them for hours, they really are excellent."
V259,Leez Priory,"I never in my life thought I would get married in a place like Leez priory! The whole experience from start to finish was just fantastic. The price breakdown was manageable and there was no pressure to take any upgrades offered. The things we got in our package were phenomenal and having a wedding planner was tremendous - our lady (Leanne) was an absolute god send!
They catered to all our needs and we were made to feel so comfortable and nothing was a problem! I’d highly suggest going to an event there before hand, just to get a feel of what it’s like full of people and enjoy their delicious food. We actually enjoyed their entertainer ( singer) so much we hired him for our wedding ☺️
Lee priory is just so beautiful. I can’t speak highly enough x"
V259,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory on the 7th of September 2024. Considering how long they have been a wedding venue, they were pretty flexible with some of the ideas we had for the venue styling that turned out amazingly!

The staff really made the day something special and couldn't have done enough for us. Special mention must be made for Leanne, our wedding planner, who was amazing!

Highly recommend the venue and the incredible team that helped to make our day so special!"
V259,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in October 2024. This venue is stunning both inside and out with immaculately kept grounds and interior. The hospitality in the lead up to and on the day of the wedding was fantastic. The food was also brilliant. Another great perk of this venue is the amount of on site accommodation.

A couple of drawbacks / experiences during our wedding. There are only a few toilets in the main building which kept blocking and overflowing throughout the evening which led to us taking some guests to the dressing room or honeymoon cottage to use the facilities. You are also restricted by the venue on any external food or drink suppliers and the venues optional extras for this are quite expensive for what they are.

That asaide, we had the best day and evening at Leez Priory and would certainly recommend it!"
V259,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in August 2024- great venue and experience from initial viewing to leaving the morning after the wedding. Leanne acted as our wedding planner and was friendly, professional and helpful throughout. We opted for the classic package and the food was amazing quality with everyone commenting how full they were!
The venue is beautiful with several options for ceremony both inside and out. Accommodation was great too. The whole day ran smoothly with perfect weather - we will have very happy memories of our day!"
V259,Leez Priory,"Perfect venue and very attentive staff, lovely food and great communication from start to finish"
V259,Leez Priory,"Stunning venue. Fantastic Team. Very accommodating toward our unique ""surprise"" strategy. Our guests were truly surprised. Thank you."
V259,Leez Priory,"Leez priory was the 1st and only venue we looked around when we started planning our wedding. From the moment we stepped on the premises, everything just looked so perfect and exactly what we wanted from a wedding venue. When we got assigned our wedding co-ordinator Rachel, she was just absolutely spot on with everything we asked for and nothing was too big an ask for her. She made sure the day ran as smoothly as possible and took care of any issue that arose without me knowing (which I am forever grateful for!!)
The rest of the staff were amazing and very helpful.

The venue itself is just absolutely stunning and we loved that it has the pub area as well as the dance floor so it catered to all of our guests.

All of the rooms were lovely and it was so nice being able to stay in the fisherman’s lodge onsite the night before the wedding.

We genuinely cannot recommend this venue enough and it was 100% worth the money! 10/10!"
V259,Leez Priory,"We got married on a Tuesday in October to maximise the value of what we could get for our money; and honestly, we got everything we wanted and more. Leanne, our Wedding Manager was perfect at bringing an attention to detail and seamless organisation to the big day, and in the lead up. There wasn't one moment of the day where we felt stressed, as Leanne had it covered. In one particular instance, our flowers for the bridal party's hair hadn't arrived. Within five minutes of telling Leanne that we needed this, the flowers were with our hair and make-up suppliers to add the finishing touches.

Leez Priory as a venue is the most stunning setting, and offers an incredible range of areas in which the ceremony and reception can take place. There is also the opportunity for the bridal party to make use of the Fisherman's Cottage the night before the wedding, and for people to stay in the on-site accommodation on the evening of the wedding, making it the perfect venue for people also travelling from further afield.

Leez Priory were very accommodating, welcoming and were happy to work with us to make our day as perfect as possible. The food was incredible, and a total hit with all of our guests, and so many people have commented on how incredible the day was as a whole. You wouldn't be disappointed to choose Leez Priory."
V259,Leez Priory,They catered to our every need. To when we would ask for things they hadn’t been done before they still made sure it went smoothly. Leanne was amazing she made me feel so comfortable from the start. The whole day was stunning. Beautiful venue please go view it as you will not be disappointed
V259,Leez Priory,We got married on the 26 May 2024. This venue was absolutely brilliant! They catered for every need and made sure there was no stress on the day. Leanne was kind and level headed throughout and was always one step ahead! Do not hesitate to book- do it now!
V260,Chilston Park,"It’s taken me a while to write this review because it’s hard to put into words how magical my experience with Chilston Park has been. We originally came to Chilston on a whim knowing they had a wedding fair on. The drive up to the hotel is stunning, we were then greeted by Jane, the loveliest and most helpful bundle of joy, Jane became our wedding co ordinator and held my hand every step of the way, we went to every wedding fair from booking last February until our wedding day New Year’s Eve just gone and every time the staff made us feel like family that was visiting. On our day, unfortunately, Jane couldn’t be there but I knew the whole wedding team by then and had no worries that the day would go swimmingly with the amazing Ella, nothing was too much, nothing was answered with no and potential issues were resolved by the time I heard about them. Ella went above and beyond to ensure our day was flawless. Matt, another wonderful human who made it his business to make sure all guests were fed and watered, completed tasks that arose with the biggest smile and again nothing was too much to ask. Multiple guests commented on the efficiency of the staff and great attitudes. We have since been to a sister hotel of Chilston and it really goes to show that everyone can have the same training but the staff truly make a hotel, Chilston is second to none. The venue speaks for itself but these words are for the team because everyone bounced into work, got excited to see us and made us feel like royalty. Paul is clearly a great manager to his team, an absolute asset to Handpicked hotels and a lovely smiley face who even came in on his day off and wished us well. If you’re reading this and looking for a venue, book it, you won’t regret it! We had exclusive use which was great value for money for what it included. The best experience, the best team and the most beautiful venue x"
V260,Chilston Park,"We were so pleased to have had our wedding at Chilston. As soon as we saw the venue, it felt right for us. Its a beautiful venue inside and out. The staff are all excellently trained. From the reception staff, through to the waiting team, through to our wedding coordinator - everyone we met was excellent. We got married off site at a church and were delayed getting back to start our reception at Chilston, but the team were so flexible and made it seem no bother at all. We had such a wonderful day and are looking at being able to go back and stay and Chilston for our anniversary!"
V260,Chilston Park,"We couldn't have asked for more with our wedding at Chilston Park. From the initial booking to the details meeting and then finally the wedding day, everything was pretty much seamless. The wedding day itself went like clockwork and the staff worked so hard to make sure that everything was in place and everyone was in the right place at the right time! All of our guests loved the setting, the food and thought the staff were wonderful. We had a truly wonderful wedding day and that was thanks to the team at Chilston Park/"
V260,Chilston Park,"We viewed lots of potential wedding venues but from the moment we arrived at Chilston Park we just knew it was the place we wanted to hold our wedding. Chloe Rees guided us through the different room options of where we could hold our wedding ceremony as well as have our reception, no question went unanswered and the hotel was very accommodating in helping us deliver our two day dream wedding. Chloe, Paul The Manager and all the staff were fantastic from the start and on the wedding day. Chef, Ali delivered exquisite food for us and our guests, with friends and family still praising it months after. We have been back a few times for afternoon tea and evening meals with all the staff greeting us with such warmth. We have no hesitation in recommending the Chilston Park wedding team and this stunning country setting."
V260,Chilston Park,"Olly and I just wanted to extend our thanks to everyone at Chilton Park for making our wedding on Friday 7th of March 2025 it was so incredible.


Sophie was the first person we spoke to and she made the booking process seamless. She was so helpful in ensuring everything was arranged before her holiday and we are incredibly grateful for her.

The day before the wedding, I had the pleasure of meeting Ella and Ellie, who went above and beyond to assist us. They were both attending our wedding and were genuinely amazing. Ella made our day so special—she took care of everything from cutting the cake to moving things around, so we didn’t have to worry about a thing. She was truly outstanding. Ellie, working behind the bar, was equally fantastic, always with a smile on her face and everyone absolutely adored her.

We can’t thank them enough for making our day unforgettable. Even the morning after the wedding, when we came down for breakfast, Ella was there to greet us with a big smile and get everything ready for us.

Olly and I are already looking forward to returning to Chilton Park when our little one arrives. What a wonderful way to start March!

Thank you again to everyone at Chilton Park, and we hope to see you all again soon.

Best wishes,

The Yeomans!"
V260,Chilston Park,"We got married at Chilston Park in August, and it was nothing short of perfection. We opted for the exclusive use package, which catered to every need. Most of our guest list were international guests, and being able to host everyone comfortably under one roof for the full weekend was incredible. From the food to the helpful staff and gorgeous grounds, I highly recommend choosing Chilston Park for your wedding if you are looking for English elegance. Thank you to the full team who made our dream wedding weekend possible! Big shout out to Sophie for helping us plan for over a year and a half!"
V260,Chilston Park,"We honestly couldn't have wished for any more.
The professionalism and attention to detail was immaculate.
Even though we were a small wedding we were never made to feel less than anyone else."
V260,Chilston Park,"We have just had our special day, and all I can say is from the moment we looked around to the day after the wedding we was well looked after, we had a designated person to speak about our wedding and all our needs were met with no questions asked. The venue and the grounds are stunning, the bedrooms are beautiful and our day was so perfect, I couldn’t fault anything. I just wish we could do it all over again. I would highly recommend Chilston Park as a wedding venue."
V260,Chilston Park,"If you are considering Chilston Park Hotel for your wedding venue let me put your mind at ease.

We got married in Chilston park hotel on the 14th January 2024 and it was the best day of our lives. All our guests are still messaging and calling us telling us what a fantastic time they had, how beautiful the ceremony and the venue are, how through the day they were never hungry and that the food really was amazing.

Although the venue may be second to none it was the staff for me who really make this venue special, the attention to detail is exceptional. From the moment we attended the venue for an open day Jane our event organiser was amazing, Jane always made time to speak to us and communication was always very prompt and very accommodating where she could be. Jane really made the whole process very easy and stress free even with only having a year to plan it all.

On the day of the wedding the team at the venue were nothing short of exceptional. Matt was our point of contact on the day I approached Matt early that morning with a few tasks and like a mind reader had assured me everything had already been taken care of. The day ran faultlessly, it became clear from the beginning of the day that the staff have it down to a fine art which allowed us to just enjoy the day.

I cannot commend or recommend this venue highly enough, thank you again to Jane and Matt and all the staff at Chilston Park Hotel for the day of our lives."
V260,Chilston Park,"Excellent service, made our wedding day a really special memory. Beautiful food, always willing to help us with advice and effort throughout our day. Would recommend for no fuss professional and enjoyable day."
V261,Eastwell Manor,"My husband and I got married at Eastwell Manor in October 2024, and it was everything we dreamed of and more. From the moment we arrived, we were swept away by the breathtaking grounds, the elegant manor, and the warm, welcoming staff who made us feel like royalty.

The entire day was simply magical. The ceremony setting was so romantic – full of charm and character – and the reception felt like something out of a dream. Every detail was perfectly taken care of, and we didn’t have to worry about a thing. The staff were so friendly and helpful, and they truly went above and beyond to make sure everything ran smoothly.

We can't thank the Eastwell Manor team enough for making our wedding so unforgettable. If you’re thinking about getting married here – do it! It’s the most magical, romantic, and beautiful venue you could ask for.

With all our love,
Mr & Mrs Clarke 💕✨"
V261,Eastwell Manor,"My husband and I married here in April 2024. The venue was stunning and guests were impressed with their rooms. The toast master Jim is highly recommended. He really brought the energy into the wedding.
Highly recommended."
V261,Eastwell Manor,"We got married in August 2024 and we had the most stress-free and beautiful wedding. It was raining on the day and our Plan A was for the ceremony to be outside, but on the day it had to be changed to Plan B. The Eastwell Manor team handled the change of plans with such ease, I didn't have to worry about a thing and the end result was better than our original plan! The wedding coordinators at Eastwell Manor are incredibly organised and professional. Jim, the Toastmaster, is an absolute delight and really brought the crowd together. The food was excellent and the tent outside was beautiful at night. We had a beautiful day and are eternally grateful to the team at Eastwell manor for looking after us so well. The rooms are stunning to stay in and the bridal suite is absolutely gorgeous to get ready in with your bridesmaids."
V261,Eastwell Manor,"We would like to say a massive Thankyou to Eastwell and their fantastic team which made our wedding day truly special and unforgettable!
From the first visit we knew Eastwell was the perfect venue for us, from the great layout of the venue to its fantastic facilities, beautiful rooms and ceremony spaces.
The wedding team were all amazing, professional and so friendly and nothing was too much trouble.
Everything organised quickly yand efficiently through email and were always very accommodating and flexible.
We really appreciate everybody’s hard work which made our day the best of our lives!"
V261,Eastwell Manor,"After getting engaged on my 40th birthday, we decided we wanted a Christmas wedding and wanted to plan it within a year. We had Eastwell Manor as one of our venue choices and after viewing it in December 23 (when it was decorated for Xmas) we completely knew it was ‘the one!’. Throughout the year of planning, Dawn and Helen were amazing. Responded to emails etc quickly, helped wherever needed, and it was lovely to have a menu tasting session in a private room. I stayed in the bridal suite the night before. A few of us had dinner in the bar which was very relaxing. The room/suite was beautiful. The bath was amazing (see photos) and I had a lovely morning getting ready for the day ahead. Our wedding was so special. To be surrounded by our guests in such a fabulous venue so beautifully decorated for Christmas, it was magical. Everyone said how great it was. The food taste delicious and was presented well. All the staff were so friendly and helpful. My husband and I stayed in the bridal suite that night and it was just great. I would 100% recommend this venue. Id also recommend a Christmas wedding as the atmosphere is something else. Thanks again Eastwell Manor, Dawn and the team, you are amazing 🤩 Love Mr & Mrs Smith (22.12.24) 🎄 xx"
V261,Eastwell Manor,"We got married at Eastwell Manor in May and honestly, it was the perfect day from start to finish! The venue is absolutely stunning — the grounds, the house, everything just felt like a fairytale. The staff were incredible and made us feel so relaxed and looked after the entire time. They really went above and beyond to make sure everything ran smoothly. The food was amazing, the setup was beautiful, and all our guests were raving about the whole experience. We couldn’t have picked a better place to say “I do”. Massive thanks to everyone at Eastwell Manor — you helped make our day so special and we’ll treasure it forever!"
V261,Eastwell Manor,"We visited Eastwell Manor when looking for venues and instantly fell in love with it. The grounds are so impressive and the inside very homely and comfortable. The wedding team are extremely helpful and professional and helped make our day perfect. The rooms are all lovely, particularly in the manor house and all guests were very happy with them. Particular thanks to Helen, Dawn, Tracey and Chris for the lead up to our big day and for coordinating our day so well without any issues. The food tasting was amazing and had a real personal touch and the food was very well executed on the day with no delays and again our guests have been saying how much they enjoyed it. Our toastmaster Jim was fantastic and also ensured our day went perfectly. Thank you to all of those behind the scenes in the kitchen and the efficient staff who assisted with the wedding breakfast and bar in the evening. Would highly recommend this venue."
V261,Eastwell Manor,"Really lovely venue, the whole day went really smoothly and big thanks to Jim who did an amazing job MCing and corralling the crowd when needed. Really made the day run smoothly, everyone had an awesome time."
V261,Eastwell Manor,"After postponing our wedding and even losing our original venue due to Covid, we knew that finding an alternative that we loved just as much was going to be tough. Eastwell Manor is every bit as beautiful as the photos suggest, and after visiting, we knew we’d found the perfect place for us immediately.
The Maid’s Garden fit our dreams of an outdoor ceremony perfectly with its ivy-lined walls, manicured lawns, pond and Italian gazebo. The terrace with its views overlooking the endless grounds was the ideal space for our reception drinks and canapés, especially on a blue-skied day in June. The wood-panelled Rose Garden Room made the perfect setting for an intimate wedding breakfast with 80 of our closest friends and family. The room was transformed for the evening reception with fairy lights (put up very kindly, and at short notice, by the venue staff) candles and a DJ, with the neighbouring Chaucer Room serving as our bar and a slightly more relaxed setting for our guests. During the evening we also held a barbecue on the terrace as the sun went down with plenty of food for everyone to enjoy.
It’s worth adding that with so much accommodation available in the Manor House and Mews, it really had the feel of a destination wedding. Friends and family were able to stay on-site for a long weekend, giving us the chance to celebrate with them the night before and all enjoy the fabulous spa facilities the day after.
We can’t emphasise enough that all of this was made possible by the outstanding team at Eastwell Manor, who literally could not have done anything more to ensure that we had the best day of our lives. They really did go above and beyond and made us both feel as if the entire hotel was our home for the day. This extends far beyond the exceptional wedding and events team. From the bar and waiting staff always happy and willing to help, to the reception staff that were on-hand at all hours and the incredible chefs that served the best wedding food we have ever had (our guests still talk about the beef!). Helen and Jasmine were a dream to work with, being flexible with all of our requests and doing everything they could to make sure that all of our ideas were realised on the day. A special mention has to go to Chris - an absolute asset to the Eastwell team, he worked tirelessly to ensure everything went without a hitch on the day, and all while looking cool, calm and collected. You really are in excellent hands with this team!
We cannot thank the whole team at Eastwell Manor enough, they gave us our dream wedding day and we wholeheartedly recommend them to everyone!

V261,Eastwell Manor,"We had the best day! The team are amazing and can’t do enough to help. A special thank you to Helen for all of your help to plan our big day, Chris for all of your hard work on the day and Jim, the toastmaster, who was absolutely brilliant and looked after all of our guests. Harry and Olex also looked after us throughout our stay.
Everything went like clockwork from start to finish, with wonderful food and great rooms.
We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this beautiful venue."
V262,The Barn,"I can not recommened this venue enough! From start to end they have been so helpful and accommodating. Phillippe & Janet made our day so special, we wouldnt have changed a thing. The staff were wonderful, they decorated the venue better than we could have imagined, the food was delicious, the DJ was amazing and all our guests commented on all of these things and more. The venue is perfect, a little oasis for a cosy, pretty wedding. Enjoyed every momement, all ran smoothly and everyone had the best time!"
V262,The Barn,"A HUGE THANK YOU to all the amazing staff at the barn everyone was truly incredible on the day and everything was even more amazing and special than we ever expected ♥️

⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️"
V262,The Barn,"Thank you so much for such an amazing day, food was fabulous, over the moon with how things went"
V262,The Barn,Wow!! As soon as I visited The Barn I knew it was the perfect venue for our wedding and I was right! Our day was absolutely perfect and everything went so smoothly thanks to every one at The Barn! Everyone made you feel so comfortable and nothing was ever too much for them! They set up the venue exactly how I had visioned it and all the guests loved the food! We love going back now for a drink or food and they are always so welcoming still!
V262,The Barn,"Amy & I celebrated our marrage at the barn which couldn't have been better.

The staff were very friendly and extremely organised, going out of their way to make sure everything flowed effortlessly.

This put us both and our guests at ease to enjoy every moment."
V262,The Barn,"I cannot thank everyone at The Barn enough for making our wedding day the best day of our lives. It's hard to put into words how perfect everything was. From start to finish every detail was well thought out, every change of plan and sudden request was catered for and throughout you knew you were in safe hands. The venue is beautiful, staff are incredibly friendly, polite and helpful. Food and drink is amazing. The list goes on and on. All I can say again, is Thank You. Cannot recommend highly enough!"
V262,The Barn,"We recently had our wedding at The Barn and from the moment we contacted Philippe we couldn’t have asked for a better experience. With only 4 months between booking and event it was great that communication and planning with Janet was easy, flexible, timely and supportive – from our plans with various music playlists needed on different sound systems to arranging our rehearsal the day before, all the little details were accommodated.

The location of The Barn is really accessible being in the centre of town, with plenty of places for guests to stay nearby, yet it feels very private as it is set away from the main road down a private street with no passing traffic. It is a gorgeous venue, really intimate but with plenty of space for our 70 guests, and the team had done an excellent job of setting up and laying out our table decorations beautifully; it was a wonderful space for us to connect with our guests.

All the staff were professional, friendly and helpful throughout the event; many of our guests commented on how lovely they were, along with how fantastic the venue was.

The food was delicious, guests choose from 4 meals on each course, and every one of them looked amazing, we’ve heard many compliments of every option. Service throughout the meal was excellent, a good level of attentive, efficient and unobtrusive, they served a large room at a good pace.

The whole running of the day was done smoothly, changing areas worked really well, we hardly noticed the hard work going on downstairs while we had our meal.

We can’t thank the team at The Barn enough for helping us have such a wonderful day and we highly recommend this wonderful venue!"
V262,The Barn,"There’s no words to describe the barn or their team. If you haven’t already booked a wedding with them, do it, and don’t think twice!

Philippe and Janet are amazing, from our initial emails and queries, through to the booking and the meeting to discuss our options etc. We were presented with a lovely folder containing all of the information, and some sample menus - given plenty of choices to give to guests (allowed up to 4 of each for adults, and 2 of each for children - loads more flexibility than a lot of other venues)

We dropped off our decorations the day before, and it’s lovely to see local businesses working together to support each other and the area (they supply discount codes for local hotels), and the Hotel were happy for us to leave a car in the car park overnight before.

When I arrived at the venue, the team had decorated it just how we wanted it, with all of our name places out, activity packs, favours etc.

Nothing was too much trouble, we had vegetarians, coeliacs and allergies - all the food was impeccable. Every single person commented on how great their sea bass was, or how tender (and huge!) the rack of lamb was, it’s safe to say they catered for everyone (gluten free ice cream, gluten free bread rolls etc). Even catered for a vegetarian child at short notice !

Their house DJ (Luke Swift) did a great job too, keeping the music flowing and people up on their feet - a real crowd pleaser.

The bar staff, were incredible - smiles all round, enjoying the day as much as we were - making it extra special.

The sweet cart, patisserie selection and cheese tower looked great too (even supplied gluten free crackers for that too)!

Philippe, Janet, Andrew, Jack & Toby (and the rest of the back of house team), thank you so much for making our day so memorable, every single one of our guests said how great they day was, and you’ve even secured a few new restaurant customers (from as far as Greenwich) who are coming back as they want to taste the other food options 😂!!"
V262,The Barn,"We had our wedding here in November & ourselves & all of our guests had the best day. The staff were nothing short of amazing, so attentive & really couldn’t do enough for you. The food was brilliant, everyone said how they enjoyed every course & the evening buffet too! You got to choose out of a big list per course, so you could give your guests 4 options per course to choose from which is very very rare with wedding breakfasts! It really is such a beautiful & intimate venue with exceptional prices. They decorated it perfectly, exactly how we imagined. We dropped 5+ boxes off the night before & a description of how we’d like everything & the staff did it perfectly. Not one thing was wrong. We had outside suppliers for a couple of decor/sweet Cart items who failed to turn up, I found out as I was about to walk down the aisle so was upset and stressed. The Barn staff, especially Phillippe, sorted everything and to my surprise in the evening we had a stocked sweet table decorated downstairs for us & our guests, they really do go above & beyond for you. We have no complaints or reservations at all about this venue & would 100% recommend it to everyone. The ceremony room looked so pretty too, with the chairs covered & the pretty twig trees, we didn’t need any more decor in there than that, the orangery is such a pretty room on its own. As is the rest of the venue with gorgeous wooden beams, it can suit all sorts of wedding themes. Thank you to everyone at The Barn for making our special day, the best day ever!"
V262,The Barn,"Patrick and I had our wedding reception at the Barn on the 31st July 2022 and we could not have chosen a more perfect venue for our special day.
On viewing The Barn, we both instantly fell in love with this beautiful venue which is also in such a perfect location in the centre of Tunbridge Wells, so convenient for our guests, many of who would be staying in nearby hotels. Having a smaller wedding, we were also thrilled that we could have the exclusive use of the venue for the whole day which later proved to add to the relaxing atmosphere of the occasion.
Philippe was so friendly and helpful in guiding us with our choices which made everything so much easier and ensured all ran smoothly on the day.
Throughout the process, Janet was amazing too and always answered my questions promptly, nothing was too much trouble.
Like many couples who get married here, we had our photos taken in Calverley park, which is just across the road from the venue, again so convenient as we did not have to leave our guests for too long.
The food was delicious, and we had many compliments, it was also wonderful to be able to offer our guests individual menus from the various choices available, a feature I would not have previously thought was possible. The welcome canapes and the evening buffet were also very well received.
Luke Swift, the resident DJ, was great too and kept the dancers on their feet.
We are so pleased that we chose The Barn for our wedding and can not recommend this venue highly enough. We thoroughly enjoyed the day and all our guests had a fabulous time.
Dear Janet and Philippe, we so appreciate everything you did to make our day so special and one that we will always remember.
Thank you so much,
Christine & Patrick x"
V263,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","The best choice we made was having our wedding at the oak barn frame farm! Not only is the space gorgeous, but it's eco friendly, has lots of different options depending on preference and weather, and they have beautiful cottages for family and close friends to stay close and the option to spend the whole weekend at the farm! It was exactly what we were looking for! And the best part was the support! Chrystelle was amazing!! She helped us through the whole planning process and gave us the invaluable list of suppliers( who were all amazing!). She is such a professional and a wonderful person! She really went above and beyond making sure we had the best day (weekend) of our lives! Couldn't recommend this place more! If you're looking for a country wedding, you've found your place!"
V263,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","We had our wedding in October 2024 at the Oak Barn Frame Farm and we couldn’t have picked a more perfect venue! From the moment we looked around the barn, we both knew it was the place for us. Having 3 barns meant we were able to keep our 50 guests entertained and still have beautiful spaces. We weren’t sure what to expect with dry-hire, but the barn is so beautiful it could be kept minimal if you’re on a budget, but being able to personalise it to how we wanted it made it extra special for us. The open fields, waterfall and sheep meant we got some amazing photos (from our photographer Matt Birchall) as well as the best memories. Chrystelle couldn’t have been more helpful, from her communication in planning, to the materials provided in the run up to the wedding, and her excellent organisation on the day meaning our wedding ran seamlessly and we didn’t have to worry about anything. The list of trusted suppliers was great too, and we used quite a few who were also great. The accommodation on site was an added bonus for us and family, and all of our friends and family commented on what a perfect venue we’d chosen. Being environmentally focused was also a huge bonus for us, as it really aligned with our values. Thank you to all at the Oak Barn for giving us the happiest day!"
V263,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","It was an absolute joy to have our wedding at the oak barn - we had the most perfect day! The team were so responsive and helpful throughout the process - we loved working with Hayley and Chrystelle!

The spaces were all beautiful and a perfect balance of indoor and outdoor in case of rain! We had so many compliments on the venue throughout the day.

We loved how much we were able to personalise the venue - from setting up the wedding breakfast decorations from scratch to bottling up our own homemade cocktails to serve throughout the day. The onsite accommodation was spotless and felt so luxurious. It was fab for all our nearest and dearest to be so close and turned it from a day to a weekend of celebrations! Thank you so much to the oak barn for making it all so special!"
V263,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","We recently had our wedding at The Oak Barn and it was the perfect place. The barn and surroundings are absolutely beautiful, the fact you can spend the whole weekend there really makes the wedding feel special with plenty of time to set up and relax.
The team are amazing, really supportive in the run up and during the weekend and ready to help with whatever might arise!
Thank you for the best weekend ever."
V263,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","I cannot thank Oak Barn enough - you made everything absolutely PERFECT!!!

Thank you for your constant eye to detail, for keeping us in line and for your creative flare.

You managed expertly to make us all so relaxed on every level. Throughout this entire process you have been so diligent, always going the extra mile and always suggesting the most fun ideas - you really made all my dreams come true.

With our greatest thanks,
Chris and Alice"
V263,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","I honestly cannot stress enough how beautiful this venue is and how amazing the staff are. From the day we went to view the venue (and fell in love the second we drive down the drive) to the moment we left the day after our wedding the staff were always on hand for anything we needed. It’s great having the cottages on site as well, being able to stay the night before our wedding and the night of made life so much easier for us meaning we could get everything done the day before the wedding and I didn’t spend the morning stressing if everything was right. This venue is truly stunning and has so many different places for gorgeous photos. Thank you again Tim and Deana for allowing us to get married at your amazing venue. Emma and Elliot"
V263,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","It was great being able to stay from Friday till Sunday which made us all feel way more relaxed than trying to do everything in a day!
The three barns are wonderful each with its own unique charm and thing to offer.
The cottages were beautifully set out and offered us and our wedding party top end accommodation."
V263,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","From the first visit of the Oak Barn, I knew it was where I wanted to get married and it did not disappoint!
The booking process and the final details meeting run so smoothly, all of the staff are extremely helpful throughout they provide you with so much information to make your organising of the wedding so easy!
We booked Oak Barn for two nights along with Weavers Cottages, it was the best thing we did… our guests were able to settle in the day before and we had everyone round for drinks and nibbles the night before making our wedding so much fun! The cottages are so comfortable with every detail thought of… waking up to the sheep in the fields is just perfect!
Chrystelle was the best, she made sure we was happy at all times and made sure everything run so smoothly even appearing during my sons tantrum (toddler) in the middle of the ceremony with cookies to calm him down. After being awake in the middle of the night replanning our ceremony to be outside due to the fact I had both of my brothers giving me away and also how lucky we were with the fantastic weather!
Both members of staff who were there on the evenings to lock up the barns were so helpful and friendly and made it so easy for us!
The Oak Barn really is the most special venue, it is absolutely stunning down to every little touch! The memories we will have from the perfect wedding here will last forever for both us and our guests! Thank you to everyone at Oak Barn for making it so special!"
V263,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","From the moment we drove down the drive for the first time, until approximately six months later when we said I do, we knew this was the venue for us. We were blessed to have unexpectedly beautiful weather for April, the presence of the young lambs adding to the atmosphere and just the perfect day from start to finish.
We hired the venue for the weekend, to enable our wider family and guests to be part of our celebration and it really did take a huge amount of stress out of the actual day. The cottages are welcoming, of a high standard, and provide all that you need, although never did get to experience the copper bath!
The whole team are hugely supportive, encouraging, making you believe that anything is possible. Each wedding feels individual and personal, limited only by your imagination. We would whole heartedly recommend the Oak Barn and its recommended suppliers."
V263,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","We made the ultimate mistake of visiting this venue first when starting to plan our big day - no where else compared.

The views (& sheep!), the beautiful barn & Byre (a choice of indoor or outdoor ceremonies), well furnished cottages for all to stay & just a the perfect feel for a wedding.

They provided a list of recommended suppliers who have worked (& are trusted) at their venue which gave us a great starting point although they were more than accommodating for anyone new.

Very helpful in the run up in the day with compiling a complete run through of the day - with floor layouts, supplier details (& got in contact with each supplier on our behalf to ensure they were equipped with all the info for the day). Even on the day, Tim was great at resolving any small hiccups that appeared.

Huge thank you to Tim, Deana, Chrystelle, Tembo & all the behind the scenes team for making our day so special."

V265,The Vines of Rochester,"We had the most amazing wedding at The Vines! I would 100% recommend this wedding venue. The food, service, running of the day etc was all exceptional. All of our guests commented on how amazing the venue was"
V265,The Vines of Rochester,"We had the most amazing wedding day at The Vines of Rochester. The venue is absolutely beautiful, with so many gorgeous touches throughout.
The staff on the day and the build up were so helpful and accommodating, which meant the day ran so smoothly from start to finish.
We would definitely recommend anyone looking at The Vines as a potential wedding venue - we couldn't have wished for anything more!"
V265,The Vines of Rochester,"Our special day was perfect, and this is credit to the wonderful Vines venue and the amazing team led by Becky and Holly.

The venue is beautiful. So much character and style. We loved getting married in the tippe, very intimate. The dining room did not need a lot of dressing and flowers, some simple styling and the space looked amazing. We loved that there were multiple spaces for our guests to use, the bar area was lively and great for chatting while the dining rooms transformed to a generous dance floor. Then our closest friends and family were able to stay at the venue with us, to enjoy a yummy breakfast the next day.
The location, venue and setting is just perfect.

The whole experience with the Vines team was very professional and well organised. Questions were answered super promptly, with confidence from the super friendly team.
The supper tasting night was great, we were able to sample multiple starters and desserts, although keep an eye out and book early.
The pre wedding appointment went through every detail. There was nothing that they hadn’t considered and care was taken to tailor to our preferences, nothing was a problem.

On the day Becky and Holly were amazing, so attentive, supportive, brilliant ladies, they absolutely made the day with lots of complements from our guests on the high quality of the team. The food was outstanding, thank you to the culinary team.
The DJ was great, tailored to our music preferences and refused any off piste guest requests! Well looked after by the evening team.

We can’t thank you all enough for such a wonderful day."
V265,The Vines of Rochester,"From the initial visit to The Vines, we knew it was the perfect venue for us. The staff team were always on hand to help with any queries or logistical issues we had, answering all of our questions and the online portal was so easy to use. The pricing is clearly laid out and there aren't any hidden or added on costs later on. We mainly dealt with Holly on the lead up to the wedding, and Becky and Will on the day. They were all so helpful and supportive. They took care of a last minute crisis when the lady bringing our dog to be the ring bearer ended up stuck in traffic. Without us even knowing, they sent someone to go and help bring them to the venue on time. Nothing was too much trouble for them. The drinks...good luck deciding what package you want as they are all so delicious. We opted for the festival wedding which was so laid back, but still organised. The food was so good and the evening buffet was lovely. The DJ included liaised with us on the lead up to the wedding and worked with us to put together an idea of what we wanted and what would get people dancing, which worked perfectly. The rooms....there are so many to choose from to be your wedding suite. We opted for a garden room. We gave the others to guests travelling to the wedding and all of the rooms are so beautiful in their own unique way. Becky and Will were on hand all of our wedding day for us and our guests and anything we needed was taken care of without a fuss. The morning after we all had breakfast with our guests that stayed over and that was such a lovely extra touch to add to the wedding. Even the timings that the planners work out mean there are non rushed transitions of moving your items out and the next wedding bringing items in; you barely notice. Being able to store items there a few days before is a huge help! Also in the lead up to the wedding they invited us to a supper evening where we got to enjoy some of the lovely food on offer. In the portal there is also a section for selling and buying wedding items which is very helpful and convenient.
Honestly we couldnt have been happier with our choice of venue and have recommended it to friends that have since gotten engaged. Amazing venue and team x"
V265,The Vines of Rochester,"We instantly fell in love with The Vines, it was the perfect venue for us and we loved having a relaxed festival style wedding meaning we had more time to mingle with our guests. The wedding coordinators were friendly, accommodating and professional. We were in such good hands and were made to feel so special. It really was the best day. Thank you so much, Alex & Tom."
V265,The Vines of Rochester,"We were lucky enough to have held our wedding day at The Vines on 4th November 2023. From start to finish, the whole process was such a breeze. Their communication was always so speedy and thorough (which is what any bride wants). There were never too many small or big questions I could ask them, as they were always so happy to help. It was honestly such a stress free experience for us and they went above and beyond. I cannot thank them enough for everything. The venue, the rooms, the food, the staff… all faultless! We chose the ‘festival’ style wedding to suit us and our guests and we still have guests commenting now on what a fabulous day and experience it was. It was very different from any wedding we had attended, in the best way possible. If my husband would let me do it all again tomorrow, I would!"
V265,The Vines of Rochester,"We had a wonderful day with our friends and family. The venue is beautiful. Such amazing photo opportunities at the venue but also in Rochester with the castle and cathedral. everyone said how lovely it is. All the wedding co-ordinaters were wonderful, any problem or question was always dealt with promptly and professionally. Our venue will always have brilliant memories of our day."
V265,The Vines of Rochester,"We had our wedding here recently and wow what a venue! It’s such a pretty venue and so many of our guests commented on how lovely it is. It has amazing locations for photos, in the sunshine and rain! And we had a mixture of both on our day. But the best thing about the Vines has to be the team that work there. They couldn’t do enough for you. They made everything seem effortless, they were so kind and accommodating and we are so pleased we chose the Vines as our wedding venue. From Becky our duty manager on the day - who was absolutely fabulous and couldn’t have done more for us - to the bar staff, waiting staff, DJ and just everyone we encountered - they were all fabulous. Thank you so much!"
V265,The Vines of Rochester,"Venue is absolutely stunning.
Staff on the day were good & couldn’t do more.
Was sold on the basis we’d have a wedding portal to help us throughout - this is only for a traditional wedding. If having a festival wedding there is nothing.
Personally I felt alone & wasn’t confident until the meeting 8weeks before to go through plans for the day- I felt if anything was not ok it was late to make amendments.
As a second wedding I knew what I wanted but was chilled, however for some this may not be a good experience.

On the day - we had pre arranged a tab with conditions, thus didn’t seem to be adhered too. I had several decorations go missing & I got no response.

We received no contact after the wedding to ask for feedback or to ask if everything was ok"
V266,Solton Manor,"Solton Manor had everything that we dreamed of for our special day. The grounds are just beautiful, the Manor House is full of character and charm and the Dutch Barn definitely has the wow factor.
The team at Solton Manor deserve a special mention. From start to finish, Karen, Jackie and the team were professional, friendly, helpful, extremely hard working and nothing was ever too much trouble. They welcomed our sausage dog, Frankie who was a very important part of our day. A big 'woof' of thanks from him!!
Our guests loved staying in the Manor House and the pretty Dovecote Cottage. The facilities allowed us to make breakfast for our guests the day after which was an added bonus! The games room with a table tennis table was a real hit too!
Highly recommend this fantastic venue!"
V266,Solton Manor,"Our wedding was everything we wanted.
Karen and Jackie were there to help and had lots of ideas to make our dream come true.
We stayed in the Manor House and the Bridal Suite is stunning. The boys used the Games Room to get ready and the girls had the whole Dovecote to themselves.
Food was delicious too!
It was wonderful, thank you so much.
Lena and Christian"
V266,Solton Manor,"Solton Manor was the perfect setting for our special day in October 2023.
Karen and Jackie made us feel at ease and were super responsive with all the planning right from our very first contact.
The day itself was everything that we wanted it to be and would absolutely recommend this venue. Thank you, Abi and Josh"
V266,Solton Manor,"From the moment we arrived at Solton Manor, we knew it was the venue for us. We were met at the door of the historic Manor House and had a fabulous time hearing stories about the house, walking around the gorgeous gardens and visiting the wonderful Dutch Barn - we were already wedding planning!
Our Wedding was such a special weekend and we loved every minute of it.
The venue is magical and you have thought of everything to make it perfect.
Your attention to detail was incredible and your help was so supportive every step of the way.
It was as important to you as it was to us that the day was the day of our dreams and we just cannot believe how perfect it was. Thank you so much for everything. Mandy and Kevin"
V266,Solton Manor,From the booking o the planning to the actual wedding was all so amazing! The team truly went out of their way to make my day the most perfect day ever!
V266,Solton Manor,"From start to finish, the venue were brilliant. Always prompt to respond, ready with help and ideas, flexible and just perfect on our Special Day. What amazing memories we made that day"
V266,Solton Manor,Shelley is so kind and helpful! The venue is stunning and I loved every minute of our wedding day there!
V266,Solton Manor,"We had our wedding in Oct2021 & Solton Manor was the perfect setting for our special day. Shelly handled the whole process from start to finish in such a friendly, helpful & efficient manner. Our wedding was postponed by 1 year due to COVID but Shelly made the whole process stress-free and she was always super responsive. We would thoroughly recommend this wedding venue!"
V267,The Darenth,"Our wedding experience was absolutely perfect! Everything was so well organised, and the staff went above and beyond to accommodate us. Communication throughout the entire process was excellent, making the day completely stress-free. Highly recommended!"
V267,The Darenth,"I cannot recommend the Darenth more. The staff were absolutely incredible, we could not have wanted for more on our day. We were never without a drink, and nothing was too much of an ask. The staff were so friendly to our guests, and really created a relaxed environment. Leading up to the ceremony they made us feel so relaxed and they were very informative. Jason, Kerry, Sarah, Louise and everyone at the Darenth, thank you so much for making our day so special!"
V267,The Darenth,"We found The Darenth when looking for a venue for our twilight wedding. We wanted our wedding to truly reflect us as a couple and where we could be flexible with how the day would go.

When we went to see The Darenth, not only was the venue stunningly beautiful, inside and out, there was a warmth to the place and the team were so friendly and very helpful. From the moment we contacted the team, Lucy was our main contact and couldn’t help us enough. Despite the number of weddings held here, we felt special throughout as if our special day was the main focus for them all. Lucy was great with all the details, understanding what we wanted and offering help and support without pushing anything.

On the day, Jason was amazing at managing the day - making sure we had time to ourselves but that the day ran exactly as we wanted. He was also very supportive and did a great job putting us at ease when we were nervous leading up to the ceremony. The whole team were thoughtful and looked after us all day, making sure we had food and drink and anything else we needed. All our guests commented on how wonderful the staff were and it allowed us to truly focus on enjoying our day. Leigh and Kerry were also fantastic on the day, couldn’t be more helpful.

We had an amazing day, everything went exactly as we hoped and better. A massive part of that was down to The Darenth and their incredible team - we couldn’t recommend highly enough!"
V267,The Darenth,"From the moment you walk into The Darenth we were made to feel comfortable. We were taken on a tour of the venue and booked there and then In October 2022 for September 2023. The staff were knowledgable and professional which is what made us book this venue.

Communication was always good throughout, we visited several times with different family members and the staff were alway welcoming. As an older couple we wanted that relaxed but professional day and this is what we got.

The venue is amazedly clean and beautiful with views of the golf course. We was lucky even to get married outside and the outside area is amazing but the staff make this place and your day the best it could be.

We dealt with Kerrie and Jason mainly but everyone we had dealings with were great. Jason ran the day and he was brilliant, I love a bit of banter and he was excellent and even made it fun when I was so nervous 😊 there was also a lady that run the evening (sorry I can’t remember her name) she was also really good making sure everything was ok and stayed until the last guest left. One thing they did do was made sure the bride and groom kept topped up with drinks all day and night again a nice touch, I didn’t visit the bar once 😀

The food was amazing and everyone commenting on how good the food was. We had 9 children and they even did a 3 course for them with milk or lemonade for the toast which was a lovely little touch and made the children part of the day.

The only thing I would have liked would be to have a dressing room on site for the wedding day rather than travelling from elsewhere but that’s my personal view.

Thank you to everyone involved in our day ❤️"
V267,The Darenth,"We got married at this beautiful venue 11.08.23 and cannot recommend enough!! Everyone commented saying how perfect the day was, and every detail was covered by the amazing staff!! Nothing is ever too much to ask - we want to do it all over again!! Massive thanks especially to Jason, Kirsty & Kerry!! My go to people on the day and leading up to the wedding! But every member of staff were just amazing and on the ball with everything. Thank you from a very happy couple 🤍"
V267,The Darenth,I couldn’t recommend this venue enough. From the day we walked into the darenth to view this venue we have always felt so welcomed and wanted. They couldn’t do anymore to help us as they went above and beyond. The venue is absolutely stunning from the outside to the inside 💕 myself and my husband would like the thank each and everyone of the staff here at the darenth no words can explain how much you made our dream become a reality 💕 we shall be booking to come back for our yearly anniversary. Highly recommend this venue*5
V267,The Darenth,"My Wife & I would firstly like to thank Jason for his professionalism, humour, and his skill in dealing with things in real time which put both of us at ease as well as all of our guests.

The catering staff on the day were magnificent and very caring towards us all.

Another plus was the generous of food which all guests appreciated, from the Canopes, Wedding Breakfast & Evening Buffet.

The only issue we did have is that it was agreed that we would have Jallof Rice with the Curry Goat & Fried Fish, but ending up having Rice & Peas with the Curry Goat.

The Jallof Rice being an African dish & Curry Goat being Carribean would have been excellent as we had them at our planning meeting 5 weeks before the Wedding.

The big disappointment was the performance of the in house DJ (Chelmer Discos).

The fact that we could not select our own DJ made us nervous about the music, hence we kept confirming whether the DJ had experience of performing for a mainly Afro Caribbean crowd.

We were advised that this was not an issue, and it turns out according to DJ that he lacks expertise with Afro Beats, Soco & Reggae.

We also asked for the love sign to be displayed as a backdrop in the Ballroom before the Wedding Ceremony commenced which was agreed upon by Chelmer Discos, however it arrived after 19.00.

When we tried to ascertain why the love sign was not delivered at the time agreed, and also, why the music was not mixed as appose to just playing tracks that we emailed to him.

In response we received a rude & threatening email from the in house DJ - Jimmy.

We both loved having our Wedding at The Darenth and all our guests have all commented on how brilliant it was & they loved Jason.

Regards. Mr & Mrs Hutton-Young"
V267,The Darenth,"We celebrated our wedding day at the darenth on Thursday 25th may.
I can not fault our experience at all. From start to finish Jason/Kerry & the team made our day perfect."
V267,The Darenth,Just had my wedding at The Darenth and what an amazing experience it was from start to finish. The staff are all fantastic they made me feel very special on my day. They kept us informed throughout the day with everything that was happening and are all so good at their jobs. The food was amazing and got so many compliments from our guests as did the stunning venue. Special shout out to Jason who was our rock during the day.
V267,The Darenth,"Fabulous venue, immaculately decorated. Kerry, Jason and the team were so kind and professional. I have worked at most venues being a wedding florist, but The Darenth was my choice. We had a beautiful day and they treated my guests like family. I will be recommending them to all my brides"
V268,The Spa Hotel,"We are absolutely overjoyed with how our religious wedding ceremony (Nikah) at the Spa Hotel turned out- truly, it felt like a dream come true. From the moment we began planning, the entire experience exceeded our expectations. Despite the tight timeline of just under four months, Emily Phipps, who I believe is any extremely talented Events and Wedding Coordinator worked tirelessly to bring our vision to life. I had so many ideas, most quite unconventional, but Emily welcomed them with open arms and went above and beyond to make it all happen.

Emily brought so much warmth, dedication, and joy to the table, and thanks to her, our religious ceremony was nothing short of magical. It’s rare to find genuine and skilful individuals in the wedding industry who can truly capture the essence of your dreams and make them a reality, but Emily did just that! We could not have asked for a more perfect day and now four months on, we find ourselves reminiscing over how perfect it was.

To Emily, Tina and Mate, we feel that you have become an extension of our own family! You were not only professional but genuinely caring, your hard work and attention to detail ensured that every moment on the day was flawless. We are so grateful for your contribution to making our wedding feel like a scene from a fairy tale. You are all an asset to The Spa Hotel Events Team!!

For anyone looking to host their special day at the Spa Hotel, we wholeheartedly recommend it. The staff are beyond talented and will treat your celebration with the utmost care and respect. They made our day unforgettable, and we will always be grateful to them for giving us memories that we will cherish forever.

Thank you, Spa Hotel, for making our dreams come true. You will always be a part of our hearts and wedding story."
V268,The Spa Hotel,"When our initial venue unexpectedly closed, we were feeling disheartened; however, we viewed The Spa Hotel and immediately fell in love with its natural beauty, especially its gorgeous Spa Temple. Our coordinator, Emily, was a star and helped us to plan our day to perfection. She was always on hand to answer any queries we had, and she also helped to set up on the day which was very kind of her! We ideally wanted an outdoor ceremony and the weather really came through for us, so we were able to marry surrounded by flowers! The day was an incredible experience from start to finish. David was our wedding coordinator on the day and he went above and beyond to ensure that everything ran smoothly. The team made the process fun and my partner and I were able to enjoy the wedding without any stress or anxiety. Thank you, The Spa Hotel team, for making our day so special."
V268,The Spa Hotel,"We couldn't be happier with our decision to celebrate our marriage at The Spa Hotel.

From beginning to end the service and attention has been incredible. From the moment I arrived to set up our decorations to breakfast in bed and clearing down the room.

We were made to feel special and so were our guests, anything that we needed was delivered.

The suites are beautiful as are the grounds, we felt so lucky to have them as a backdrop to our day.

Our meal was 5*, incredible, we received so many compliments, and food was a big part of the day for us. Delicious!

Thank you, to everyone."
V268,The Spa Hotel,"My husband and I got married and celebrated our wedding reception at the Spa Hotel in December 2023. The day was a dream from start to finish and the team at the Spa did absolutely everything to give us an unforgettable day. Tasha, our wedding coordinated, worked with us from the moment we started planning with the Spa and was available via email and phone regularly to help us work out the details of the day & evening. The setting is beautiful at the Spa, especially at Christmas with all the trees, lights, and decorations. The food was fantastic, everyone commented on how tasty the wedding breakfast & canapes were. The team were so responsive & helpful with the fact that I do not drink, so had all my alternatives to hand all throughout the day. What a perfect place to get married and celebrate our wedding, thank you so much to Tasha and all the team at the Spa Hotel!"
V268,The Spa Hotel,"Beautiful venue, amazing food, the best personable service from the first meeting to the last drink on the day! Thank you so much to Emily and David at the Spa hotel"
V268,The Spa Hotel,"Thank you so much! We had such a great day. For us the best day of our lives so far!

I could not fault the hospitality of you and your staff. If something wasn’t there you guys were straight on it. Nothing was too much to ask. Maty really put our minds at ease. Making sure I didn’t fall down the stairs and having water ready for us when he knew we’d be shaking before starting the ceremony!

It was like a well oiled machine and we didn’t have to lift a finger which took all stress away completely.

A lovely touch was adding the petals in the room and tidying up before we came upstairs. Made us relax so well.

Everyone was so helpful. I’d also like to mention how helpful one of your staff was. I’m not sure of his name, he had red hair. He could see I was panicking in the morning and reassured me by telling me everything was being set up for the ceremony. He was very accommodating and I’m sure he’ll go far in your industry!

Also thank you to Emily. Everything went so well and that’s all down to her coordination. Every staff member knew what needed to be done.

Again thank you so so much!! I’m sure we’ll be back again and of course we will be recommending you guys to everyone we know!!"
V268,The Spa Hotel,"We cannot thank the spa hotel enough, they were so incredible and the whole process made us at ease throughout. Our guests were so impressed at the quality of service, food and drink. We even had guests with sensitive allergies at our day and they had no issues. Everything went perfectly thanks to all the staff.
I couldn’t recommend them more to anyone. So thank you the spa hotel for making our dream wedding."
V268,The Spa Hotel,"We are so happy that we chose to have our wedding day at the Spa Hotel! Right from the beginning, you were so fantastic - fielding questions, keeping us on schedule with jobs and always being a very lovely friendly face to speak to whenever we needed. We so, so appreciate you.

The wedding venue was so beautiful - the photographs have come out so well! The backdrop is absolutely stunning. I’ve just forwarded you our wedding video tease and I’ll send some photos separately. Please feel free to use on any social media.

Your team on the day were great too, so lovely and kind to us."
V268,The Spa Hotel,We got married earlier this summer at The Spa Hotel and it was fabulous. Everybody there is so professional and are experts at what they do. Everybody was so accommodating and helped make our day so incredibly special. The organisation from everybody was amazing (in particular Natasha) and we had the best day. The day went without a hitch and was everything we dreamed of and more. Our guests had a great time and the food was incredible. I can't recommend The Spa Hotel as a wedding venue more!
V268,The Spa Hotel,"After months of planning, discussions and decisions we were finally married at The Spa Hotel, Royal Tunbridge Wells on Saturday.

Thank you to Tasha, David, Jake and the whole team for helping us on the way and delivering a perfect day (despite the weather) with superb and attentive service as well as everything we requested meeting and exceeding our expectations."
V269,Winters Barns,"This was the first venue we visited in person and knew from the moment we walked in the door, walked through the grounds and spoke with the team (Sophie) - this is where we want to get married.

The pre planning process, the correspondence, the queries, the multiple visits - nothing was too much trouble and everything was addressed promptly and in a detailed manner (if it was easier to explain something over the phone rather than email, thats exactly what they would do).

The venue was perfect for guests to explore and roam (& children) but can be contained in a safe surrounding.

On the day, I think it was summed up perfectly by our videographer ""the team are fantastic here, and if anything does go wrong on the day you wont even notice - they are so professional"". We can contest to this - it was perfect!

Thank you Sophie and the Team
x"
V269,Winters Barns,"This venue gives 10/10 for everything. We had looked at four venues before this one. As soon as we walked in we knew it was exactly what we wanted for our winter wedding and the need for onsite accommodation. The service was second to none, we didn’t have to lift a finger on the day and didn’t need to check anything or worry about anything. The caterers were five star, the service was exceptional, all of our guests remarked on the extremely professional service and amazing food. I would give it all 10 out of 10. The band, The Redfords were also superb, in the evening. Sally looked after everything superbly. If you want a magical stress free day that runs like clockwork - book it!"
V269,Winters Barns,"Winters Barns was the perfect setting for our wedding.
We had the most amazing day and could not recommend it highly enough.
Lizzie was absolutely amazing and made the whole process so easy for us.
Everyone was there to help but they were not intrusive at all.
All our guests were blown away by the service and the food - everyone has made great memories.
We have some amazing photos from the grounds and it was so easy having everything all in one place - from getting ready to staying overnight.
Even the set up and taking down was done for us so we didn't have to think about anything - we could just enjoy it all.
I could not have wished for a better venue and they exceeded our expectations by far!"
V269,Winters Barns,"For a venue as busy as Winters Barns, they truly made us feel like the only people getting married, remembering the small details and providing invaluable advice throughout planning and coordination. Getting excited with us during the planning, liaising with our vendors and giving us helpful prompts as we got closer to the day. We never once struggled to get in contact with the venue or get a clear answer on our questions… and there was a few!
On our final meeting where we ran through all the little details, we were met with suggestions and solid guidance which left us feeling confident our dream day was going to come to life as we imagined.
Sally is a SUPERSTAR and our day was run to perfection thanks to her. She pays attention to detail and run us on time to the minute, but she also had lots of fun with it. Popping in to check on us all getting ready always with a big smile and some sound advice and a little time check! Sally put us both as ease as we knew if there was an issue she would resolve it.
Our day at the venue was perfect, from getting ready and building up to the ceremony, it was faultless. The call button in the getting ready spaces is brilliant, this saved the men who were all struggling with their pocket squares and needed super Sally to come and save them!
The accommodation was beautiful and the perfect way to extend the celebrations a bit longer with a recovery breakfast with our families the next morning.
We honestly had the perfect day, as did our guests and have received endless compliments on the venue; the service and everything in between. If we were to relive the day we would not change a single thing.
Thank you so much to the winters barns team and Sally, we couldn’t have done it without you!"
V269,Winters Barns,"Right from the first appointment we knew the venue was gorgeous and it was the one for us! Since booking the staff were always so helpful over emails for any queries whilst I was planning! On the big day we had Lizzie look after us, she is truly the best at what she does!!
I was so set on having an outdoor ceremony but due to weather it had to be inside, however I wasn’t disappointed! It was beautiful inside especially with the fresh new hops (September wedding). Everything went smoothly and we couldn’t have had a better day. We used all the accommodation on site too which was great, clean and comfortable!"
V269,Winters Barns,"Winters Barns is an incredible venue. It has a beautiful rustic charm, from the exposed beams in the bar, wedding breakfast and dance floor areas, to the dried hops hanging from the ceiling. The courtyard is stunning and was well used by our guests well into the evening. The pond with the bridge makes for beautiful pictures and was a huge selling point for us.
The staff were truly amazing. I cannot fault them. They’re incredibly warm and friendly and really do make you feel special. They never once gave the impression they do this every day, rather that yours is the most important day in the world!
We absolutely loved our day - it was truly unforgettable, largely thanks to the brilliant team at Winters Barns."
V269,Winters Barns,"A truly stunning venue! We cannot thank Winters Barns enough for making our day so incredibly special. The staff are so friendly, welcoming and professional, nothing is too much to ask of them and they ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible. We were able to fully enjoy our day knowing everything was being dealt with behind the scenes.
The venue and its grounds are beautiful, the perfect setting for some stunning wedding pictures! The facilities at this venue are amazing from the garden, the barn itself, the salon and pump room to get ready in the morning of the wedding. The accommodation is beautiful and so incredibly clean!
If you’re looking for a barn wedding, I cannot recommend Winters Barns enough! You will not be disappointed! Thank you once again!"
V269,Winters Barns,"We would to thank Sally and her team at Winters Barns for making our special day come to life. This venue is absolutely beautiful allowing for some stunning photos. All our guests commented on its cutsie barn vibes and well maintained grounds.
The food was exactly what we wanted with our 3 course meal and evening food, all delivered with amazing service.
We couldn’t praise or recommend this venue enough!
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
V269,Winters Barns,"Our wedding at Winters Barns was a dream come true. From the moment we arrived, we were captivated by the enchanting atmosphere and timeless charm. The stunning surroundings and well-maintained grounds created the perfect backdrop for our special day.

The staff at Winters Barns went above and beyond to ensure every detail was perfect. Their professionalism and warm hospitality made us feel truly special. From the seamless coordination to the meticulous attention to detail, the entire day ran smoothly, allowing us to relax and fully enjoy each moment.

The ceremony area, with its rustic elegance and intimate setting, created an unforgettable experience. The reception space was equally impressive, with charming decor and a spacious layout that comfortably accommodated our guests. The lighting and ambiance added a touch of romance, making the evening even more magical.

We can’t rate Winters Barns highly enough. It exceeded our expectations in every way, providing us with cherished memories that will last a lifetime. If you’re looking for a wedding venue that combines beauty, elegance, and exceptional service, Winters Barns is the perfect choice."
V269,Winters Barns,"This is a fabulous location with great flexible spaces both indoor and outdoor options.
Sophie and the team were great communicators. Incredibly organised, and took all the stress of the away allowing us to enjoy the best day of our lives. 😍🥂"
V270,Cooling Castle Barn,"Cooling Castle Barn really was our perfect wedding venue. We fell in love instantly and it was the only venue we looked at for our wedding and booked immediately before we even left! The price of the venue and what is included is incredible, it was worth every single penny and we’d highly recommend. Every single staff member we came into contact with couldn’t have helped enough! Out toastmaster (Steve) was absolutely amazing and co-ordinator on the day (Chelsea) was so so helpful with everything that we needed and made sure that everything was sorted and we didn’t have to think of a thing on the day! The getting ready rooms were perfect and the food was absolutely incredible!! We had so many comments about the food and the venue in general from our guests, everyone absolutely loved it!! Thank you so much, we had the most amazing wedding at the most perfect venue x"
V270,Cooling Castle Barn,"From start to finish, the staff were so friendly and professional! Everything was broken down and made so simple, the app was incredible to help keep track of planning. On the day Becky was honestly everything we could have asked for, she kept us updated on everything that was happening whilst we were getting ready and made everything run so smoothly. Would recommend this venue to anyone, we had so many compliments on our choice and had everything we needed under one roof! Topped off by returning to our room with champagne, cake and chocolates. We cannot say thank you enough!! Mr and Mrs Jeeves x"

V271,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We got married on 17 May 2024 and planned a weekend of celebrations with our family and friends, including a 'We tied the knot' cocktail party in the Brasserie on the 18 May 2024. The hotel has a number of quirky and interesting spaces perfect for adding a different feel to parts of your celebration as well as different photo opportunities. It has a trendy and luxurious feel with lots of unique and modern touches. OWP is also a stones throw away from the historic Pantiles which whilst not only beautiful also had a selection of bars, restaurants and boutique shops to entertain our guests during down time. Many of our guests commented it was like being in Europe and again the surrounding areas are perfect for photos.

Not only is the venue beautiful, but the staff and service are absolutely incredible and I do not say this lightly, the service was second to none and everyone was welcoming and friendly creating a true home away from home experience. Karen our Wedding Co-ordinator was amazing and flexible to our different needs. One of the things that attracted us to OWP was our wedding was treated as an individual celebration something we had not found at other venues which had a fairly set itinerary. The food was amazing with a large choice of options, we opted for a deluxe choice menu and it did not disappoint. It was also great value for money which enabled us to carry out our celebrations over a long weekend whilst also focusing on our entertainment and creating the atmosphere we wanted.

If you want a venue that is modern, trendy, flexible and different from the traditional country house wedding then I highly recommend. We have a weekend of memories at One Warwick Park with our nearest and dearest that we will treasure forever and can't wait to return for our anniversary's.

Thank you to the whole One Warwick Park team! Sarah & Sam"
V271,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We had the pleasure of having our wedding at the Warwick Park Hotel, it was an amazing experience for us as a couple and all our guests. Karen our Event coordinator was great with us, she was very receptive to our ideas and did all she can to make it possible even though our wedding was on short notice.

For the actual day, the whole team was excellent, nothing was too much for them.

They went above and beyond for all our guest, one thing that stood out for me was on the day of the wedding the Club room which was the standard complimentary room for the wedding night was used by my wife to get ready in the morning, to avoid us getting back to the same room and enhance our experience on our big day we were upgraded to the Deluxe Room with other complementaries which just made our day perfect. All our bags were moved for us we didn't even need to touch anything which was a really nice touch for us.

Can't say a thank you big enough to Karen and her excellent team, we were chose Warwick on recommendation and we can boldly say we were not disappointed.

And will definitely recommend Warwick Park Hotel to anyone looking for a top of the range service and venue.

Thank you."
V271,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We had an amazing wedding! The venue allowed us to be flexible with our requirements. We had so many lovely comments about the venue, hotel and food. Service and staff were amazing.
The day went to plan and was perfect in every way.
Our wedding meal was lovely. The function room looked beautiful.
Our room, junior suite was spacious and really enjoyed the 3 nights we was there.
Thank you to Karen and all the staff for making our day so special!!"
V271,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We had a lovely day at One Warwick Park for our wedding. Karen was very helpful and stayed the entire wedding day. Finn and Alice are 2 amazing members of staff.
The food was lovely and everything was organised well. Thank you OWP."
V271,One Warwick Park Hotel,"One Warwick Park is utterly amazing for a wedding venue!

I cant thank Karen and every staff member at OWP for making our wedding day perfect.

Karen and I connected via emails and calls in the months leading up to the wedding, the communication was perfect. Everything I ever asked for or things we talked about nothing was never a problem, Karen and the OWP team were brilliant to work with.

The venue is so gorgeous, Modern and Elegant. The Room is bright and large with a gorgeous fire place and open brick wall with wooden beams.
The hotel rooms are so sophisticated and modern. We stayed in ‘The House’ and for Bridal party prep this was the perfect location!!! It was dreamy!!! Spacious, comfy beds, gorgeous kitchen and bathrooms. It was so special to stay with bridesmaids & Family members the night before, but each of us having our own bedroom in a house environment, the House is just amazing!

The food was fabulous!
The chef created some gorgeous dishes for 80 guests, many with dietary requirements, this was no trouble at all and each guests feedback about their meal was that it was all delicious! Thank you chef!!
Our evening buffet – the compliments we received were great here too!. Especially the chicken goujons!
The wedding tasting afternoon OWP hosted to sample wedding day food was amazing. We tried all the wines and dishes, it was so lovely to enjoy this day as a pre wedding day date day. Thank you so much!

I popped into the venue multiple times before the wedding day to visualize and ask various questions that I ever had. Any team member I ever met was so friendly, helpful and kind. Nothing was ever a problem for anyone.

Days before our wedding I sent Karen a photo of some cocktails I liked, Karen worked with the food and beverage manager to bring my idea into reality. I was so happy – thank you so much!

On the day of the wedding Karen you popped in and out, and were there to support me from 7am - I loved it so much the way you kept connected with us, thank you!
My emotions were high throughout the day and this didn’t phase you at all, your support was truly appreciated!

We could not be any more happier with the way our wedding day went. We had such amazing feedback from our guests on how gorgeous the venue and the hotel are. And How good the food was!

Thank you so much for everything Karen. You are great at what you do!!
Enjoy every moment of your own wedding very soon! We are sending you all our love!

Please pass our huge thanks to everyone who worked and helped us during our wedding.
It is so very much appreciated. xxxx"
V271,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We will never be able to thank Karen and the whole One Warwick Park team enough. We would highly recommend this beautiful venue to anyone planning their wedding and are truly grateful for the effort that went into ensuring our day was exactly what we wanted. The food was amazing and we had lots of compliments from the guests on how friendly and polite the bar staff were.
Thank you for helping to make us the happiest we’ve ever felt. We can’t wait to come back and stay for our first wedding anniversary."
V271,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We always knew we wanted a boutique venue to suit our modest budget and the moment we saw OWP we fell in love with its chic and simple interior, perfect for putting our own spin on our special day. Karen and the OWP team were fantastic throughout the wedding planning process. No request was too big/ difficult for Karen and she was so attentive to our wants and needs. We had the most magical Christmas wedding and cannot be happier with how it all turned out! Thank you Karen and team for making our special day perfect!"
V271,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We loved this wedding venue the first time we saw it. We wanted a Christmas wedding and the room with the beams, lights and Christmas tree looked amazing. Planning of the wedding was helped by Karen who gave fantastic recommendations. Nothing was too much trouble. We had the most amazing day. Big thank you."
V271,One Warwick Park Hotel,"Cannot thank Karen and the OWP staff enough for our magical day. From the moment we saw the venue we fell in love and everything was so simple and we wanted for nothing.

The venue has a modern class in an area of Old style beauty. The venue can comfortably hold either a large number or a smaller more intimate celebration and will still look magical."
V271,One Warwick Park Hotel,"Where do I even start….

When we first visited the hotel I knew it would make the perfect venue for our wedding. The function room was perfect, modern, perfect size, the bar was amazing. It just ticked all the boxes.

Karen was absolutely amazing, she was there every step of the way answering all my question and giving advice. She helped us organised our day and help us make an idea on paper turn into the most amazing day.

Before the wedding day we got to attend a wedding menu tasting session was great, every dish we tried was lovely and so happy with our choices everyone at the wedding said how amazing the food was.

On the day the help from all the staff was amazing from welcoming our guests and helping all our suppliers, made me feel so calm as the bride as I knew I didn’t have to worry about anything. From start to finish the wedding was perfect and it wouldn’t have happened without the help of Karen and everyone at the hotel - they turned around the rooms so quickly and the service from the bar staff was perfect.

I couldn’t recommend this venue enough they have everything you need and more for the perfect wedding."
V272,Chapel House Estate,"Chapel House Estate and the team were absolutely amazing! We knew from the first time we saw the venue that it was the one - every single location is beautiful and provides stunning photo opportunities. Every person that we spoke to was so helpful, especially Georgia who was our fabulous on-the-day co-ordinator! We did have a few issues with music during dinner but these were promptly rectified by the staff (with the help of the Head Chef's phone!). The food was absolutely fabulous and I think everyone who came to our wedding was absolutely blown away from start to finish. Thank you so much for making our day everything we dreamed it would be!"
V272,Chapel House Estate,"The most amazing, stunningly beautiful wedding venue, catered for our micro wedding with as much care an attention as a big wedding, Jade our wedding co-ordinator was amazing! The food in the no 9 restaurant was as out of this world! Highly recommend!"
V272,Chapel House Estate,"We cannot recommend Chapel House Estate enough. From the very beginning the team here were so helpful and accommodating.

We’ve been to weddings before that have felt a little disorganised and of course, things can happen out of anyone’s control, however, as soon as booked our wedding here we felt like we were in safe hands. Throughout the entire process, we felt so at ease, and that’s thanks for the team. Georgia and the team worked so hard for us and it really showed. The day ran so smoothly.

The grounds in the venue are truly stunning too and offered the perfect backdrop for our special day. We decided to get married in August as we really loved the orchard and gardens, and to top it off we spent the rest of the day in the beautiful courtyard. We have to mention the food too. We opted for the BBQ option and wow. It was so delicious and all our guests really loved it.

In summary, you won’t regret getting married here. The venue is stunning, the team are fantastic and the food is to die for. Thank you so much Chapel House Estate."
V272,Chapel House Estate,"We had our wedding here in the court yard this last Sunday and all I can say is wow - they exceeded our expectations and more .

V272,Chapel House Estate,"My husband and I got married here in August and had the most magical day. All the team, particularly Georgia, Lori, Jade and Sam, were incredible in organising our day and ensuring the day went seamlessly.
Every detail was perfect.
The venue is truly breathtaking and all our guests were blown away by how magical it looked.
The food was exquisite which all our guests have continued to talk about.
We couldn’t have asked for a better day and will continue to visit for our anniversaries.

V272,Chapel House Estate,"We got married at Chapel House Estate in August 2023.

From being shown around the venue by the owner a year earlier, we knew it would be perfect, and indeed, it was!

The grounds are beautifully maintained.

The Chapel House has been finished to an exquisite standard, and the other accommodation on site is great and was loved by our guests.

The whole site was impeccably maintained and as clean as a whistle.

There is ample parking.

The Team went out of their way to accommodate us, with a bespoke menu and served individual alternatives for those with non standard dietary requirements (vegan, veggie and various intolerances!).

The food was of an exceptional standard for over 100 guests and the service was both charming and faultless. It was apparent to us both that the entire team were committed to making our wedding day a resounding success!

In short we were completely blown away by the venue when we first saw it and it overdelivered! What a superb venue!

Special shouts out to Jade, Georgia and the chefs! You are now part of our story!

Would we recommend it?

YES, WE WOULD!"
V272,Chapel House Estate,"If you're dreaming of a wedding that transports you to a faraway destination without leaving the shores of Kent, look no further than Chapel House Estate. This hidden gem is a testament to luxury, elegance, and the promise of an unforgettable wedding experience.

From the moment I stepped onto the grounds, I was whisked away to a Mediterranean haven. The outdoor waiting reception area exuded charm and sophistication, adorned with lush greenery, fragrant blooms, and tasteful decor. The soft rustling of leaves and the gentle breeze lent an air of serenity, setting the perfect tone for the day.

The outdoor wedding setup was nothing short of magical. With sweeping views that seemed to stretch endlessly, it felt as if I was watching the exchanging vows in a private paradise. The attention to detail in the decorations was impeccable, and the natural beauty of the surroundings only enhanced the atmosphere of romance and celebration.

The resort's reception area was a true showstopper. Elegant and opulent, it provided a stunning backdrop for speeches and the main course. The seamless blend of indoor and outdoor spaces allowed us to enjoy the best of both worlds. The expansive glass windows offered uninterrupted views of the picturesque surroundings, while the tasteful interior design added an element of grandeur to the celebration.

The culinary experience was nothing short of extraordinary. The menu showcased a fusion of flavours that left myself raving for more. From delectable appetisers to the exquisite main courses, every dish was a work of art washed down with the very best drop of Rosé. The culinary team's attention to detail and dedication to creating a memorable dining experience was evident in every bite.

The staff at Chapel House Estate were outstanding with a special shout out to Katie for really going above and beyond. Their professionalism, warmth, and attentiveness ensured that every aspect of our special day ran seamlessly. They anticipated my needs before I even realised them, and their genuine smiles and willingness to go above and beyond left a lasting impression on myself and it seemed all guests. A huge kudos to Darren & the force on such an incredible team dynamic.

In conclusion, Chapel House Estate is a true gem in Kent, offering a wedding experience that rivals the most exotic destinations abroad. The combination of breathtaking outdoor spaces, luxurious indoor settings, world-class cuisine, and exceptional service creates a truly unforgettable celebration. If you're seeking a wedding venue that transcends the ordinary, Chapel House Estate is the perfect choice. My heart is filled with gratitude for the memories that were created in this enchanting oasis."
V272,Chapel House Estate,"This venue is first class. All our guests said it was one of the best wedding venues that they have been to. Our day surpassed all of our expectations. The staff made sure the day was seamless. Food was great, service was amazing and the venue is stunning. Would highly recommend to anyone in a heartbeat. Special thank you to Jade and Georgia for ensuring the day was so special. X"
V272,Chapel House Estate,"A few weeks ago my partner and I had the complete pleasure of attending our dear friends’ wedding at Chapel House Estate.
Of course it was lovely to attend and be part of their day. We had heard good things about the venue, but we were taken back with its fabulousness.
Close by to our home in Broadstairs, we felt we had arrived at a far away country estate far further away than we have travelled.
This set the perfect stage for the quintessential and stylish day of celebrations, which continued with partying and fun into the late evening.
The day was faultless.

Having worked in the wedding and events sector both in the UK and the Middle East, I have been lucky to have experienced many events, both as guest and a professional.
The wedding at CHE was up there with the best, from the F&B to the furnishings and staff.
In fact so good it even made me consider getting married again!"
V273,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"The team at Port Lympne were absolutely phenomenal. Months of planning and working with us to ensure our big day would go off without any issues, and it led to a really stress-free day for the both of us, allowing us to fully enjoy our wedding day.

There are far too many things to mention, it’s simply impossible to fully cover the scope of everything they have done for us as part of our wedding.

Guests were raving about pretty much every aspect of the day, and many said it was the best wedding they’d ever been to and probably will ever go to. Quite a few of the vendors made a point of communicating a similar sentiment to us as well!

Comminication is unparalleled, they will do everything they possible can to accommodate any request you may have, and worked tirelessly to provide us with an amazing experience.

We really did get to have a dream wedding, far beyond anything we could have ever imagined.

An immense thank you to everyone, the staff on-site, logistics team, event coordinators, etc… everyone came together to put us first and make the day the most amazing day of our lives."
V273,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Port Lympne is an incredible venue, such a unique and special location for your special day. We had spent our first weekend away as a couple there so it was great to go back 6 years later to get married.
All of our guests loved the venue and the day, and they still talk about the safari and how incredible it was.
Sadly for us, we were let down by the operations team on the day which caused unnecessary stress. The event team were great in the build up, with a few minor issues due to limited flexibility on their end. We also had about 3 different main points of contact due to staff turnover and therefore the package we agreed to and had changed and led to tense discussions. The issues for us arose on the day where the event team handed over the wedding to the operations team who we hadn't met and it seemed to be the first time they had heard of our wedding. Despite handing them a detailed folder explaining how the tables should be laid out, seating plans and all the other essentials, they made numerous mistakes resulting in the wedding party having to fix many of these just before the bride arrived! A few of our suppliers commented how it felt like the venue mustn't have had many weddings due to some of the issues on the day.

However, despite all of these challenges, everything else was magical. The venue spaces are incredible and the food was exceptional. The safari was a real highlight for us and all the guests."
V273,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"We couldn’t have chosen a more magical venue for our wedding than Port Lympne. The setting was absolutely breathtaking—our guests were in awe of the views and the atmosphere - and that was before the wedding started!

The team at Port Lympne went above and beyond to make sure every detail was perfect, allowing us to enjoy every moment without a worry. The pergola and the orangery looked phenomenal in sun!

provided such a charming space for our reception. The food was exceptional, tailored to our tastes, and so many of our guests commented on how delicious it was.

One of the highlights was incorporating the wildlife reserve into our day. After the meal all of our guests got on trucks for a guided safari, which they absolutely loved—it added such a unique and memorable touch to the whole experience.

We couldn’t recommend Port Lympne enough. It was truly the perfect venue, and we’ll cherish the memories of our special day forever."
V273,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Port Lympne is an absolutely stunning venue, from the moment you arrive, you can feel how special and beautiful it is. The pergola has been designed so beautifully, with faux flowers intertwined all around it. It doesn't need any further decorating, it is stunning. What is great about this too is that the staff can put up Perspex glass over the windows if the weather isn't ideal, or can leave the windows open for a nice breeze if the day is good. The orangery is breath taking. As a bride, the worry about making either of these areas look pretty was a job already completed. Easily, the best and most beautiful venue.

The Wedding Team are incredible from start to finish. Nothing is too much trouble, they respond quickly to emails. I felt so cared for throughout the entire process, both myself and my husband were impressed by them. It is more expensive than other venues, but they are worth it. I'd hire them again in a heartbeat. We changed things close to the wedding day, the team easily accommodated, we asked for a different area for the reception drinks (we had to pay for this), but again, the team said yes and adjusted the scheduling in a thoughtful manner so we had more time by the southern terrace.

Food is amazing. We had lots of compliments about this. They catered for a number of vegetarian and vegan guests with ease. The evening buffet was so good. Plenty of good high quality food. I really was impressed.

We had the safari between the meal and evening reception - it was the best. Guests loved it, we loved it.

Honestly the best venue and staff. I want to attend a PL wedding as a guest now!!"
V273,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Looking for a spectacular, unique venue with exceptional customer service? Look no further than Port Lympne! It's hard to find a better wedding venue. From the staff to the views, the facilities to the accommodation, and the food to the animals, everything is outstanding. Every member of staff goes above and beyond to make everyone feel welcome and to provide unforgettable experiences. Words like ""unbelievable,"" ""breathtaking,"" and ""stunning"" were frequently used by our guests, many of whom claimed it was the best wedding they had ever attended.

Special shout-outs go to…

Ceyda: Thank you for being our incredible wedding coordinator. Your responsiveness to countless emails and your dedication to making our big day exactly what we dreamed of were remarkable. Thank you for altering our function sheet so many times without question and for holding my drinks and fluffing my dress when needed!

Charlotte: Your calming presence and willingness to accommodate every request were invaluable. Thank you for keeping me calm in the morning and for your excellent communication throughout the day, ensuring everything ran seamlessly.

Our glorious toastmasters, Jonathan and Nikki: WOW, what a duo! Thank you for ensuring our day ran smoothly and for guiding our guests flawlessly. We (and our guests) loved both of your outfits, especially the park ranger uniforms.

Harry: Thank you for rescuing me and my bridesmaids when we locked ourselves out of Rhino Lodge.

Wedding breakfast serving staff: Your prompt, well-coordinated, and faultless delivery of our food was exceptional.

The chefs: Thank you for producing a mouthwatering three-course meal that was beautifully presented. Our guests couldn't believe the high standard of food and that all main courses were served hot. Thank you also for accommodating special requests and dietary requirements.

Evening bar staff: Your constant smiles and enthusiasm, especially joining in with the Macarena, added so much fun to our celebration.

Hotel staff: Thank you for assisting our overnight guests with check-in and ensuring their bags were taken to their rooms, allowing them to celebrate without interruption.

Our wedding at Port Lympne was a dream come true, thanks to the incredible team and the breathtaking venue. We highly recommend it to anyone looking for a truly magical wedding experience."
V273,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Venue
We opted for Port Lympne to start with as we were swept away with the beauty of the venue. It’s truly the most beautiful place we visited. The mansion house is a lovely reception area, the pergola and orangery are private so just your guests get to enjoy this section. The pergola is light and beautiful, and perfect backdrop for a ceremony. It’s really easy to dress up with flowers, as it’s already so beautiful it doesn’t take much.
The orangery is amazing, high ceilings, beautiful greenery & rose bushes surround the area. There’s lovely lawns which you have the option to play garden games on & have photos.
The Moroccan courtyard is perfect for photos, and again doesn’t need any extra dressing or decoration to make it look beautiful - it’s simply stunning everywhere!

The Wedding Team
First the venue sweeps you the way, then the staff do! They are extremely helpful, lovely and attentive. I emailed them a couple of times a week leading up to the big day and they replied within a few hours every time.
On the big day they weren’t overbearing, no request was too much & they were there whenever we needed them.
They do multiple walk throughs with you & introduce you to everyone who is working on your wedding so you know who to ask if there’s any additional requests.

Food & Drink
On the lead up, you get to try the wedding food. They also offer a choice of two for starters mains and desserts (in contrast to other venues we viewed which only allowed for one choice).
The food was incredible, rich and yummy (not dry at all which you sometimes find with wedding food).
The queue for the bar was quick all night (and we had over 100 guests who are all big drinkers). There was no draught beer which we were worried about, but it was fine on the day as this meant everyone was served quickly.
The wine they pair the food with was gorgeous - and again you get to try all this before the big day.
They were accommodating to vegetarians and multiple allergies. This was all planned before hand & we had no issues with this on our day.

Safari
We opted for safari and it was a really magical and memorable touch. All our guests loved it!
You also get to use the buggies the day after the wedding (up to 10am) which is a lovely way to recover from the wedding and a fun way to start your first day of marriage bliss!

There’s nothing more we could have asked for! Perfect for 100-150 guests."
V273,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Port Lympne was an outstanding venue the whole team amazing from the events team to the ground staff always welcoming and helpful up to the day and then the wedding itself.
Safari it’s a great added extra guests totally loved. The mansion house was a perfect venue that sold it for us on our first visit. Outstanding accommodation across the site and food across the day was perfect.
Thank you port lympne team."
V273,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Our October wedding at Port Lympne was stunning - we had our ceremony in the Pergola followed by a reception in The Orangery, and the day ran smoothly. The staff are friendly and accommodating, the venue itself is beautiful with very little additional decorations needed, the safari was a huge talking point and we've been told repeatedly that the food was the best anyone had at a wedding all year. We'd definitely recommend booking your wedding here, you won't regret it."
V273,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Port Lympne as it's no normal wedding venue, it's the Disneyland of Kent wedding venues. We would also like to say a big thank you to Stephanie who worked so hard to make sure the day was perfect. She made our dream weddings come true with Georgina, and Olivia, who handled every aspect of the day so well. All our guests were blown away and had the time of their lives. They keep telling us how perfect the venue was. It really does have it all: 5 star food, the most stunning spaces, water features, coastal views, and breathtaking grounds with animals from across the world (which all our guests got to see as part of our day). If you are looking for a venue that ticks all the boxes Port Lympne and the team can and will make this happen.The team managed everything so professionally, and they made our dream come true! Thank you from the bottom of our hearts."
V273,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"We were married at Port Lympne on the August bank holiday 2023 and would thoroughly recommend the venue.

The Port Lympne team were incredibly helpful and responsive throughout. No question or detail was too much for Stephanie and Annie, who provided an excellent standard of service; they were straightforward to deal with and any concerns or queries were dealt with swiftly.
The wedding day itself ran smoothly and was truly memorable for both us and our guests. The combination of the pergola and the orangery provide for a stunning venue. There are also so many locations for beautiful photos!

A key reason we chose Port Lympne was the high-quality food we had experienced on previous visits to the garden room. For our wedding breakfast, we selected the sea bass with brown crab gnocchi, which was delicious and enjoyed by all guests. There is also an option to select a second/alternative main for those who preferred a non-fish dish.

In the evening we surprised our guests with the safari; it is a must-do and made the day truly memorable and unique.

We also had over 50 guests staying at the venue overnight and Stephanie and Annie efficiently co-ordinated the transport and accommodation elements.

Overall, we had a fantastic day and would highly recommend Port Lympne to couples seeking a unique and special wedding day."
V274,Salomons Estate,"I am so happy my (now) husband and I decided to have our wedding here! Everything about our big day was nothing short of perfect. From the moment we looked at this venue, I know it was everything we wanted.

Our day of coordinator, Leah, was absolutely lovely. Not only is she attentive, but she is kind, thoughtful, and incredibly detail-oriented, making every part of the process seamless and stress-free. I can’t be more grateful to have had her by my side.

The venue decorated for the holidays just days before our wedding, providing us with beautiful added decor and magic! My friends and family love the many rooms and areas to explore, including the museum, gardens, bar, terrace, etc.

We opted for afternoon tea for our wedding breakfast and pizza for late night bites and our guests absolutely loved it! They offered options for our friends with gf, veggie, etc dietary requirements, and people raved about their meals! They have options for everyone.

Between the beautiful venue, genuinely lovely staff, and delicious food and drink, I cannot be more grateful to Leah and everyone at Salomons. I got to live out my fairytale dream wedding here, and I am so excited for every couple who chooses to do the same. You will have the best day of your lives."
V274,Salomons Estate,"The venue is absolutely stunning which our guests also commented on, from the impressive driveway entrance to the beautiful decor inside. We had our ceremony in the Gold Room which had so much detail we did not need to decorate too much further. We then moved through to the Drawing Room for our Wedding Breakfast and Evening Reception. This was the perfect size for our wedding and we were able to decorate the whole area (including the bar and lounge area) creating an inviting atmosphere. The staff are absolutely amazing, from the initial enquiry to the planning to the actual day. The Events team were always on hand to answer any questions or emails and the bar staff on the day were so polite and professional. Even after the wedding, the following day, the staff were still happy and helpful. The food is amazing and so tasty, it was served quickly and hot , allergies were very easily accommodated and the prosecco was lovely. There was nothing that was too much trouble and our Wedding Planner Leah could not do enough to make sure everything went well."
V274,Salomons Estate,"Salomons will now hold a special place in our heart forever. Thankyou so much for everything. Erin our coordinator was incredible and I’m so pleased with her ethics, friendliness and experience. Thankyou!"
V274,Salomons Estate,"We had a summer wedding at Salomons and were lucky enough to have an outdoor ceremony and cocktail hour. It was the perfect place to host our guests (we had 140 guests) and there was a lot of space for everyone to explore, sit and walk around.
We had many compliments about the quality of the food. Our suppliers even said it was the best meal they'd had while working! We did the Sharing Roast and having the guests in chef's hat to carve the roast was a very popular part of our day.
I can't compliment the events team at Salomon's enough. In the last month before the wedding, they were so responsive and went above and beyond. We had a few changes in staff on their side and changed our main coordinator but it had 0 impact to the quality of our day.
On the day, our coordinator Willow was exceptional - keeping the show running and making sure that everyone was well looked after.
We were beyond happy with our wedding and Salomon's will always hold a special place in our heart!"
V274,Salomons Estate,"What can I say, this is a beautiful venue for start. We had Willow as our coordinator and she was beyond perfect! She made sure everything was on point and was excellent with communication! The staff on the day were so helpful and friendly, everyone was raving about them. It was just amazing! I wish we could do it again! Our wedding was three weeks ago, so we are still on cloud 9. The venue catered for all our guests dietaries & were amazing with accommodation!"
V274,Salomons Estate,"Salomons Estate was more than I could have asked for. Erin, our coordinator, was so on top of things throughout the day and so helpful. We had to plan this whole thing from abroad and it was quite stressful but Erin was so calm throughout the process and there were no issues whatsoever. The venue was absolutely beautiful and such a great space for hold events - highly highly recommend! Also, the food was excellent!"
V274,Salomons Estate,"I cannot recommend getting married at Salomons Estate enough.

The whole team are amazing to work with and when first visiting I felt so relaxed and at ease in their company - a lot of other venues felt very pushy in comparison looking back.

We absolutely loved that they had so many options in regards to food and drinks packages. We went for their bbq option which was perfect as we didn’t want a 3 course sit down, we wanted something a bit more relaxed. The food was delicious and everyone said they felt really full compared to some other weddings they’d been to!

The grounds themselves are stunning. We were so fortunate that we got married on the terrace, but the back up room inside was also beautiful if the weather hadn’t been on our side! We had our reception in the science theatre that is such a unique room and so beautiful.

Our wedding parties stayed the night before in the gatehouse and the bridal cottage, most of our wedding party also stayed the evening of the wedding in the hotel accommodation. This really extended our wedding celebration and I’m so grateful we could all stay on site in lovely accommodation.

I could go on and on for hours, but to summarise; the venue is not only stunning but is matched in amazing service."
V274,Salomons Estate,"Salomons was a beautiful location for a wedding! We had a winter wedding and chose it because we liked the indoor setup for our wedding for approximately 100 people, and also wanted on site accommodation. However, the grounds are beautiful and we got lucky with the weather and have had many pretty shots taken outside.

The events team helped us pull together our wedding plan and ensured matters ran smoothly on the day. We had a great time with the tasting in the lead up to our wedding. We also used a number of the recommended suppliers from Salomons and together they put together a truly amazing wedding. Erin helped coordinate our day and also chaueffered us around for our photos as the grounds were a bit wet!

The catering team did a top job on the day. Our guests were raving about how good the food was, and how generous the portions were too! Salomons offered a good selection of wines and their F&B team were flexible to try to source drinks that weren't readily available on the menu. If needed, we were able to supply our own bottles and pay corkage.

My father has some health issues, and the team did everything they could to make his experience on the day as comfortable as possible. I'm really grateful to Salomons for this.

In summary, I'd highly recommend Salomons Estate as a venue for anyone considering a wedding venue in Kent."
V274,Salomons Estate,"We knew instantly when we arrived to view the venue that this was where we wanted to get married. We were made to feel at home, and nothing felt like too much bother. The team were constantly on-hand to answer questions throughout the process, and catered to all of our requests. We had never really thought about an outside wedding, but the South Terrace took our breath away when we saw it in person!
Our wedding day was magical, and ran completely smoothly due to the hard work of the team throughout the day. Our guests commented on the service of the team - there was never a queue at the bar, there was always someone on-hand to help out, and our wedding planner (Fiona) had this magic ability of being everywhere at once! The food was outstanding, and our guests were well-fed and watered during the day. We honestly couldn’t have asked for more from the team!"
V274,Salomons Estate,"We got married at Salomons Estate in June 2023 and it was incredible! We literally have zero negatives to write. Everything from Fiona and her team was brilliant. The care and attention to detail, the day went smoothly and perfect.
All of our guests commented on how delicious the canapés and food were.
We will 10000% be returning for our anniversary.
Thank you everyone at Salomons for ensuring we had the most perfect day."
V275,The Castle Westenhanger,"We had our special day here in April 2024 and all we can say is incredible!

The booking process was easy and so personal, the online planning system was so easy to use and the Westenhanger team were always at the end of an email if we needed anything at all - nothing was too much trouble.
The day went perfectly to plan thanks to the wonderful wedding coordinators, the food was amazing, the DJ was brilliant - genuinely there was nothing we would have changed.

We can’t thank the Westenhanger team enough for everything that they have done in making sure that our wedding day was perfect."
V275,The Castle Westenhanger,"We had an incredible day and are still getting so many compliments from our guests and suppliers on how beautiful the different parts of the castle and its grounds are. It was an unusual wedding (queer Jewish/Christian interfaith), but Jackie, Vicky and co helped to make sure that we had all the things that were important to us, from the vegan food and alcohol-free drinks to the gender neutral toilets to getting the dancing going before the meal had even started. The ceremony room was perfect (and a special thank you to the person who went up on a ladder to put a covering over the boar head that's mounted on the wall!), and we had some amazing photos and videos back from our photographers/videographer highlighting the beauty across the entire venue. We also really appreciate that the company running the venue sent many of the key staff members on trans awareness training so that we could have the most gender-affirming day possible. Thank you Westenhanger team!"
V275,The Castle Westenhanger,"This place is a gem and an absolutely stunning setting for special occasions. We had our daughter’s wedding there in June. The staff were attentive from the moment we first visited to look around, to the time we left having packed up everything the morning after the wedding. The food was delicious and generous portions the drinks were flowing. The castle is authentic and steeped in history which gives it a magical atmosphere."
V275,The Castle Westenhanger,"I can honestly say hand on heart that a typical ‘Wedding’ was not a bit of me. However, there is nothing Typical about Westernhanger.

The magic is created as soon as you walk in and even more so on my day as we had snow!! Transported into a winter wonderland with the most beautiful atmosphere and decorations.

The staff were honestly so incredible and I cannot even begin to thank you for guiding me through my day. You took everything out of my hands and I trusted you all. Your professionalism and expertise ensured that our day ran smoothly. Every single guest commented on how amazing the dinner service was and so professional. Also the food was stunning.

The evening DJ was great and although I took a turn for the worst, due to a sickness bug I couldn’t help but get up and boogie. The evening guests shared that the buffet was incredible.

On behalf of my Husband and I we would like to thank you all for creating and being a part of the most magical day. And if you’re anything like me and do not do ‘Typical’ this is the place for you. Westernhanger will always have a place in our hearts and we’ve made our own history in this incredible historical place."
V275,The Castle Westenhanger,"The team at Westenhanger were so warm and welcoming. We had travelled from up north to come down and looked at multiple venues. The castle was the only venue that we got emotional at. It is gorgeous. We had a huge numbers of friends and family travel down for the day, and many have said it's the best wedding they've ever been to. We did find that perhaps coordination was slightly lax for us, but that could be more of a criticism of ourselves. A really, really lovely team of people. Thank you!"
V275,The Castle Westenhanger,"Tania, Jackie and Bex are an absolutely amazing team. We had such a chill wedding day with everything running smoothly. The Castle grounds are beautiful and looked amazing in the October sunshine. The inside of the castle is perfect for the ceremony and the marquee is great for the reception. We really wanted photos in the dovecote and they turned out lovely."
V275,The Castle Westenhanger,"Westenhanger Castle is an absolutely amazing wedding venue! From the moment we set foot on the grounds, we were blown away by its beauty and historical charm. The staff at Westenhanger Castle couldn't have been more helpful throughout the entire wedding planning process. They went above and beyond to ensure that our special day was perfect in every way.

The team at Westenhanger Castle was incredibly accommodating, helping us with every aspect of our wedding, from selecting the ideal ceremony location to assisting with catering and decorating decisions. Their professionalism and dedication to making our day unforgettable were truly remarkable.

Our guests were also captivated by the beauty of the venue and the warmth of the staff. We received numerous compliments about the exceptional service and the incredible ambiance throughout the day.

In conclusion, Westenhanger Castle is not just a wedding venue; it's a fairytale setting where dreams come true. We couldn't have asked for a better place to start our journey together, and we are immensely grateful for the exceptional support we received from the staff. If you're looking for a wedding venue that combines history, beauty, and exceptional service, Westenhanger Castle is the perfect choice"
V275,The Castle Westenhanger,All the staff from start to Finnish and after are amazing. From enquiries to information and service. Spectacular venue. If you’re looking for honestly care love and so much more. This is the venue. No faults here. Food is wonderful. Would highly recommend!! Zach and jo
V275,The Castle Westenhanger,"From our first meeting, the staff were so welcoming, knowledgeable and responsive to any queries we had throughout the planning process. We had a lot of guests with dietary requirements, so the choice of menus was important to us when choosing a venue. There was a great selection of meals to choice from and the chefs were accommodating where we needed to tweak things!

The venue itself is of course stunning and a real stand out feature is the space for both the bridal party and groomsmen to get ready for the big day! All the staff on the day made sure everything went smoothly and we were able to relax and enjoy the day!"
V275,The Castle Westenhanger,"We cannot recommend The Castle at Westenhanger enough. Quite simply the best. A totally professional team who made our day so special. Everyone and everything was perfect and far exceeded our expectations. On top of this, the team really did make us feel more like friends than customers and really did seem as excited as we were about the day. From day one of planning to clearing up our things the day after, we were met with smiles and hugs and made to feel genuinely special. If you want good old fashioned professional service wrapped in the friendliest of company at a venue that looks stunning, then you have found the perfect venue in Westenhanger."
V276,Lympne Castle,"We couldn't be happier with how our wedding turned out. The venue is just stunning - a beautiful castle, lovely grounds, and overlooking the sea. We had a very small wedding of 15 guests, and we were treated like royalty. We had access to the full castle and spent the day wandering between different sections, enjoying every single one. The food (we had a BBQ) was delicious, and the staff were wonderful. It was all coordinated by Joy who was a pleasure to work with. She spent the day seamlessly coordinating everything behind the scenes, whilst looking after and playing with our dog which was such an appreciated touch! We stayed at the cottages on the castle and they were fantastic. Not only big and full of character, but it also made logistics so much easier having our guests at the location. The new castle bistro (the Naughty Dog) also meant everyone had a place to meet, drink and eat inbetween wedding events.

The best thing about the castle is that it caters for all types of weather. So no matter what you get on the day, you'll still have an incredible experience.

Finals things: the photos you'll get will be outstanding. What a backdrop! And the prices are extremely reasonable. We highly highly recommend this venue."
V276,Lympne Castle,"Great venue, beautiful and so many amazing comments from our guests. The different rooms and spaces made it more and gave the variety we wanted

The team also worked very well to be flexible with last minute changes to make it work and I can’t thank them enough for that

The views are stunning"
V276,Lympne Castle,"So we got married in the church (next door) and hired out one of the rooms in the castle for our reception.

I can’t fault the service. It was spectacular and really made our day special. I don’t think I’ve ever had service like that where the staff are so professional, personable and just amazing all round. We were aware that we didn’t hire out the venue or anything like that specifically for our wedding - it was a room in the castle so we didn’t really expect much. But the staff made us feel like we did. They even roped in some of the gardeners to pull smoke bombs for one of our pictures! The staff made every effort. Laura and Mike were great and went beyond expectations. We just have no complaints at all with anything. It was an amazing day.

The castle itself is picture perfect and for us was the perfect setting. It’s rich in history and the attention to details is incredible. There’s multiple rooms of varying sizes. We had a small wedding so hired out one of the smaller rooms but it looks like they can cater to a wedding of any size. We also stayed in one of the cottages within the castle grounds along with the guests which were equally perfect.

Pretty much every wedding I’ve been to the food has been mediocre at best. But the food here was great. Everybody really enjoyed the food. The kitchen obviously know what they’re doing so kudos to them.

This is honestly the best place to have your wedding. You’re in very safe hands with the staff here, the castle is gorgeous (and the views!) and the we couldn’t think of a better place to do it.

Thank you for the special day!"
V276,Lympne Castle,"Our wedding day was absolutely faultless from start to finish! The wedding team were so helpful and knowledgable throughout the planning process and our coordinator Dan looked after us for our wedding day - thank you Dan!
Lympne Castle is such a beautiful venue, and we can't wait to visit again once the castle bedrooms are ready!
Love, Sarah & Tom"
V276,Lympne Castle,"From start to finish, the staff at Lympne Castle were amazing. Professional, courteous, and incredibly helpful. We planned our own wedding, and although I feared it would become overwhelming, Kate made it so easy for us. The day came off without a hitch and everything was just beautiful, from the venue to the food. I am so grateful to all the wonderful staff, Kate and Mike, Joy, and all the sweet and charming servers. You made our wedding perfect!"
V276,Lympne Castle,"Lympne Castle could not have made our wedding day more special, it was a beautiful and intimate occasion from start to finish. We got to decorate the chairs as we liked and having the rooms to get changed in made it very easy in the end. The food was good and the staff very helpful, especially Mike and Laura. Everything was thought about and all ideas welcomed and accommodated where possible. We had the best day and would repeat it in a heartbeat to soak it all up again. The castle was a little bit of history that made the start of our adventure even more magical. Thank you to everyone at Lympne Castle."
V276,Lympne Castle,"Lympne Castle was truly perfect in every way. The Bridal Suite is stunning and was such a great space to enjoy the morning with my bridal party. We were lucky enough to get married on the lawn outside, the view is unbelievable and our guests were wowed! Our wedding breakfast was held in the Great Hall and genuinely felt like something out of a fairytale. The food throughout the day was amazing and the staff were so attentive and accommodating - especially our wedding coordinator Kate (we can’t thank you enough!!). I’d recommend Lympne Castle in a heart beat and our guests still talk about how magical the venue was - can we do it again please?! Love, Mr & Mrs J"
V276,Lympne Castle,"I could not imagine anywhere else more perfect for a wedding. It was our first and only venue viewing, we fell so in love with it that we booked a date there and then. We loved that our ceremony, reception and accommodation (we used the cottages) were all within the grounds plus the added bonus of the new bridal preparation room. We also had the benefit of Christmas trees and log fires which made our winter wedding particularly festive in the castle setting. The building and views are stunning - our guests were in awe! Aimee, our coordinator was first class in communications, expertise and ensuring the preparations and day ran to schedule. Nothing was too much trouble for her, even helping the grooms party with their buttonholes, a kind and personal touch. The staff were fabulous too and made us all smile with their lovely comments about our celebrations. The brilliant chefs offer an impressive menu, catering for all dietary choices and it is both delicious and beautifully presented. Lympne Castle had everything we could have wished for and more, it is a truly special venue, one of a kind."
V276,Lympne Castle,"Lympne Castle is the most perfect wedding venue. Not only is it absolutely stunning, has roaring fires, beautiful grounds and views but you get the whole venue exclusive which for us was a big bonus!

From the moment we booked it as a venue we were assigned a wedding coordinator - ours was Aimee and she was fantastic! Anything we needed she was super quick to reply and so helpful. We visited the castle lots and went to one of their dinner nights (which I highly recommend.) Our wedding day couldn't have been as smooth as it was if it wasn't for Aimee and her staff they made everything so easy for us and she even held my umbrella and helped me across to the church in the morning.

Everything that the staff do is perfect - the food is superb and the whole venue flows nicely for guests. If you are thinking of getting married here look no further or even for a party - it's a fantastic venue and you won't be disappointed."
V276,Lympne Castle,"well what can I say!! an amazing venue with fantastic staff. From beginning to end we were given so much personal service from everyone at the castle but Aimee was amazing!!! from small little touches around the castle to making me and my now husband feel calm before the big moment...Aimee must have had a Mary Poppins bag as she had everything we needed on hand from sewing kits to mints, scissors and glue and we couldn't have asked for a better day. Thank you for making our day so special ...even to the last touch of a hug goodbye this morning ."
V277,Chafford Park,Amazing venue for our wedding in the summer. Alicia and Sarah worked really hard to make sure we had the best day possible. Both the indoor and outdoor ceremony areas are beautiful and the main barn is a perfect setting for food and dancing. Couldn’t recommend highly enough.
V277,Chafford Park,"Chafford Park is a beautiful hidden gem in the glorious English countryside. From the moment we visited, we felt welcomed and really put at ease by the team and the family. The grounds are stunning, with so many opportunities to explore and capture our favourite moments!
With of having use of the two spacious barns to use we were able to really bring our vision to life, and the day panned out perfectly. The venue hire includes the day before your wedding to set everything up, and we booked to stay in the onsite accommodation in the Long Barn (a must!), which really put my nerves at ease knowing that everything was taken care of before the day.

Sarah and the team were extremely helpful, ensuring we had everything we needed for the day. All of our suppliers went above and beyond, the waiting and bar team were super attentive and great fun!

We had so many of our guests commenting on the venue, the service and the day itself, we just couldn't have asked for more.

We honestly couldn't have imagined our day being any better, we are still on a high from the entire day and cannot recommend this venue highly enough. Thank you so much!!"
V277,Chafford Park,"We knew we wanted to hold our big day at Chafford Park as soon as we first visited the previous spring. We always wanted a venue which was a blank canvas that we could put our own stamp on and it was perfect for this, with the two beautiful barns for us to dress and decorate for the ceremony and wedding breakfast and free reign on our choice of cater, but with a emphasis on trying to keep it local which we liked. The journey for the bridal party from the house to the ceremony barn is beautiful too, passed the pond and through the trees.

As we both work in events we loved having the bell tents as the backdrop for our friends to stay in and having the fire pits and festoon at night time gave the outside area a real festival feel.
It was also a big plus that we could stay on site for two nights - we legally got married on the Friday with a small group of family and friends and then cooked a big meal in the house that night.

Alicia and Sarah were helpful and prompt with any queries in the lead up and we’re very grateful to Charlotte who made sure everything ran smoothly for us on the day itself too.

We hope to return one day for a glamping weekend and to reminisce."
V277,Chafford Park,"We recently celebrated our wedding at Chafford Park, and it was an absolute dream!

The team's dedication to making our wedding unforgettable, from the initial planning stages to the last dance, the staff demonstrated a fabulous level of commitment. They took care of every detail, ensuring that our vision came to life seamlessly.

Our guests couldn't stop raving about the stunning venue. The charm of the barns, coupled with the picturesque surroundings, created a warm and romantic atmosphere that perfectly complemented our day. The natural beauty of Chafford Park added an extra layer of magic to our celebration, making the entire weekend feel like a fairytale. Waking up in the long barn was nothing short of glorious. The tranquillity of the setting and the connection with nature created a serene and peaceful atmosphere. It was the perfect way to start our journey as a married couple.

We loved having the use of two barns one for the ceremony and the other for our reception and the transition from one space to another was seamless, and it made the entire event flow effortlessly. We appreciated the thoughtfulness behind this arrangement, allowing us to savour every moment without any stress.

Our experience at Chafford Park was beyond our wildest dreams. If you're looking for a venue that combines natural beauty, thoughtful design, and a dedicated team, Chafford Park is the perfect choice."
V277,Chafford Park,"Could not recommend Chafford Park more. It is such a beautiful venue and the team are constantly improving and adding extra touches to the venue.

I loved the ability to chose our own caterers - I was able to bring in my African heritage by choosing an African caterer and it really made the day feel unique and special to us.

The sound system is unusual but once you are underneath it, it is great. We worked with a recommend DJ and saxophonist from Mint DJs who were really great and got the party started.

The added touch of having rooms on site for the family really made it easier. We were able to have a lovely family dinner the night before and able to enjoy the farm for the full three days.

Really was our dream day and we are so grateful."
V277,Chafford Park,"Where to start...what a beautiful wedding venue. So picturesque and relaxed. The grounds feel luxurious and private without losing the homely aspects we wanted for our special day. We knew when we looked at Chafford Park that it was the perfect place for our wedding. Sarah, Alicia and Catherine are an excellent team who have an eye for detail and really made sure we were looked after throughout the lead up and on the day. All questions are answered promptly and with care. The landscaped area around the stunning barns provide a perfect backdrop for photos and the barns made the most intimate space for our ceremony and reception. We are so grateful for the time and care to make our day so special. Highly recommend to go and view Chafford park and find out why it is just so special."
V277,Chafford Park,"Even though we had torrential rain on the day, Catie and Sarah made the day flow really well. All staff were incredible and so friendly. The grounds are incredible too. We wanted a laid back wedding with a slight rustic vibe and this delivered! Thank you all, I just wish I could do it all again xx"
V277,Chafford Park,"By far the most beautiful wedding location I have been to. The estate owners and staff were so professional and truly went above and beyond to make my sisters wedding the most special day of her life. Thank you Sarah, Alicia and the team! X"
V277,Chafford Park,"Despite the stunning facade of this venue, its owners and managers are incredibly rude, making planning and having a wedding at Chafford Park an uncomfortable experience.

On our first visit before booking, we loved what the venue offered and how beautiful it was. Sarah the owner was pleasant and kind and we consequently booked a week later.
However after booking, there followed 12 months of terrible communication, pulling back on previous promises made and generally being very uncompromising with our plans.
We didn’t feel Sarah or her daughter Alicia were on our side at any point and felt that they were more concerned about keeping their venue pristine than helping people have a beautiful wedding.

We had such a magical wedding day, despite them. Our guests and vendors contributed to an incredible day and I didn’t feel stressed at all. But behind the scenes, our catering staff and wedding coordinator were having to deal with so much hostility from the managers. They came in, in the middle of service to tell the staff that the kitchen area was too messy!! So incredibly rude and completely unprofessional. And this was only one incident amongst many that I heard post wedding where they were rude and disrespectful towards vendors and guests alike.

You are also obliged to partner with Wild Box to serve the drinks when you book this venue - they work closely with Chafford Park so essentially are almost as hostile. There are many things that you can’t do - put up your own decorations, bring your own alcohol or have a campfire past midnight. We luckily found our way around all of this but they made the whole thing so difficult and uncomfortable.

I would encourage anyone to not be lured in by the beautiful surroundings and look elsewhere if you want a more friendly and compromising service."
V277,Chafford Park,"We had the most amazing wedding at Chafford Park! It really is the most stunning venue, especially in June when everything is in full bloom. We really wanted as many of our friends to be able to stay with us across the whole weekend and this venue offered just that. The Glamping tents were a huge hit with our guests and the long barn where we stayed was beautiful (and perfect for getting all the girls glammed up on the big day!) Being able to access the venue from Friday morning until Sunday midday meant we could fully enjoy time with firends and family who had travelled so far to be with us.

Alicia and Sarah were so helpful, making sure everything was just as we wanted it and that the day ran smoothly. We couldn’t have pictured a more perfect place for our wedding and can’t wait to return for some more glamping in the years to come!"
V278,The Ferry House,"Where do we start with this review? Well, if you are looking for a venue that has practically everything this is it. The staff are fantastic, they were brilliant from the day we booked it and even after the event. They were helpful all the way through the journey and on the day the staff we great. Our guests had the most amazing time and all said it was one of the best weddings they had been too. Granted the weather helped, but a mild sunny day in April made it perfect. The food was 10 out of 10, really do recommend the upgrade on the menu choices and wine. The in house DJ was also excellent. In fact everything went to plan, there was nothing negative just the perfect magical day."
V278,The Ferry House,"We got married at the Ferry House last Saturday and had the most amazing magical day and that was all down to the incredible team at The Ferry House.
Sam & Chloe were our wedding coordinators on the day and they were absolutely faultless, the day ran perfectly and that was all down to them both.
The food was incredible and every one of our guests commented on how amazing the food quality was.
The rooms were super comfortable.
The venue overall was just incredible, we would highly recommend anyone getting married to celebrate here.
Thank you all"
V278,The Ferry House,"This venue is a hidden gem, we didn't know about it until we were looking at Venues and we instantly knew this was the place for us. Relaxed, rustic, caring and everything in one place! The venue itself is so warm and inviting with the log burning fires, rustic bar, barn and amazing surroundings. The team go above and beyond to make your day extra special.
The food selection is amazing, we had the hog roast which everyone commented on!
Thank you to everyone at The Ferry House, our day was amazing!"
V278,The Ferry House,"Our winter wedding at The Ferry House was just perfect, and that is all thanks to the amazing team. The care and attention to detail they had to understanding our vibe and making our vision come to life was just second to none. We have so many amazing memories of the day and also the planning stages. The setting was beautiful, the food and drink were amazing, and the staff were all super friendly.
All of our guests loved everything about the day and are still talking about it now.
Thank you so much for making our wedding dreams come true, core memory made!"
V278,The Ferry House,"Our special day tailored to our exact requirements, staff professional from original viewing to the day, cannot thank them enough, what they always say about a good place is the staff make the venue, and they sure do at the ferry house. Beautiful venue in picturesque surroundings worth every penny"
V278,The Ferry House,"The Ferry house is an absolutely amazing , our wedding day was magical .
Our guests all said what a beautiful venue .
The food is outstanding and all the staff are very helpful. From the first planning meeting up to the day of the wedding .
Nothing was to much trouble if I had a query they was always at the end of email .
Myself and the bridal party stayed at the cottages the night before , this really added to the excitement of our wedding day .
The rooms at the Ferry house are decorated to a high standard and are very comfortable. The food is amazing.
We would highly recommend this venue . Our wedding day was perfect ."
V278,The Ferry House,"I don’t even know where to start - the Ferry House was the perfect venue for our big day. Nothing was too much trouble and they made the whole planning process so easy. I have worked at weddings myself and know how venues can sometimes be difficult and reluctant to help with certain things but not the Ferry House!
They decorated the venue with my diy decorations without any issues, they answered my constant emails (crazy quickly!) and even put up with me doing everything last minute!
The actual day itself, they were so helpful, excited for us and just made us feel amazing!
The venue is just absolutely gorgeous - nearly every guest came up to us on the day to tell us how amazing it was and they honestly felt it was the best wedding they had been to! All thanks to the Ferry House. If we could do it all again we would both choose the ferry house again in an instant."
V278,The Ferry House,"We just wanted to say a huge thank you to the whole Ferry House team for all of their hard work, support, kindness and helpfulness in making our day so incredibly perfect. Our guests were so amazed, and keep telling us as much!

It wouldn't have been as wonderful without the team all part of it, and Josh was the best DJ! He played some absolute tunes. Owen took great care of everyone down by the firepit.

Chef and his team put out some absolutely incredible food, everyone has been raving about it since. The food was simply perfect, we're having roast dinner withdrawals at this point....

Katy took care of me and pampered me for six months in the run up to the wedding with the facials, definitely one of the best parts of wedding planning, she got rid of any worries in each session, I will definitely be continuing with those, I miss her already! They should be a must for every bride to be!

Maxine & Georgina, where can we start? They were both the most organised, reassuring, fantastic team, they were truly perfect, being the calming voices of reason, and helping move everything indoors in the morning.

We would write an essay about how amazing each and every one of the Ferry House team are. Every single one of the Ferry House team are truly one in a million, and TFH are very lucky to have them all."
V278,The Ferry House,"Our son has just been married at The ferry house.
From start to finish the staff and wedding team have been incredible!
The attention to detail, care and kindness of all the staff is the best we have ever received. They were simply amazing.
The venue itself, is totally worth the journey .
It was absolutely stunning and took our breath away when we saw it decorated.
We stayed overnight and the rooms were beautiful, clean and really comfortable.
Our buffet breakfast in the morning was delicious, full of fresh produce.
The food did not disappoint, it was the best wedding breakfast meal we have had.
Congratulations on a top star venue and a brilliant team of staff from the washing up lady to the wedding planners (Maxine was especially brilliant and also our assigned host who never stopped smiling despite our requests for this and that).
Thank you one and all for making Harry & Dan’s day totally amazing! We couldn’t have asked for more ."
V278,The Ferry House,"The best team of people you could ask for! Every single person we spoke with was so helpful and lovely to deal with. They made our day so special and run seamlessly! We couldn’t have asked for a better team!
The food and drink is the best around, locally sourced making it all taste so much better! And the views, away from everything so you can really soak in the day with your loved ones with no distractions!
Couldn’t ask for more"
V279,Hayne House,"I fell in love with Hayne House the second we went to our viewing and it only got better from there.
The pre-wedding process with the team at Hayne House was amazing, they were so accommodating and responsive and had answers to all the question that my Type A Bride brain threw at them. Throughout the planning process they were fabulous and it was so nice to find a venue where we could both get ready on site in the morning.
On the day, the Hayne House team (Beth) were absolutely fabulous. Beth kept me calm all morning and made me feel like we were in safe hands. We DIY-ed all our decor and Beth asked my input on the set up before the Groom turned up which really put me at ease. Beth also managed our ceremony music on a phone and it just made me feel so comfortable. Pre-aisle walk, Beth really helped me understand what would happen and really set my nerves at ease. The whole team were incredible and they made our day so so perfect.
We couldn't have asked for more. The venue is stunning and the team are amazing! I would recommend Hayne House to absolutely anyone! We also really loved the sustainability initiative, as we're both conscious of that, and that's what initially made us look at Hayne House. 100000% would recommend!"
V279,Hayne House,"We were married at Hayne House in August 2024, it was one of only 2 venues we selected to view at relatively short notice (we decided to give ourselves only 6 months planning time and were lucky they had availability for our chosen weekend!) - Sam was the first person we met and so welcoming. She really helped us imagine, in the cold of winter, how our summer wedding could be. We absolutely fell in love with the orangery from seeing the photos, but the reality was even better. Our key criteria was a venue that felt like a summer garden party, and you really got a sense of the lovely grounds by being able to see out to them all around you, even from inside the venue.
Becky gave us some great guidance throughout the planning, and Ella and team made the day run very smoothly.
6 months later, our guests are still talking about the beautiful relaxing day - it was everything we imagined - and better!"
V279,Hayne House,"Safe for the children to run around already beautiful so don't need to much decoration, staff couldn't of done any more on the day to help."
V279,Hayne House,"Hayne House was absolutely perfect.
The wedding Co ordinator Ella was so professional. She kept everyone calm and organised throughout the day. Would highly reccomend Hayne House as a wedding venue everything was fantastic!"
V279,Hayne House,"Hayne House was just the most perfect setting for our wedding. It’s private and beautiful surroundings coupled with amazing staff, food and suppliers - we couldn’t have asked for more or had a better day."
V279,Hayne House,We couldn’t have asked for a more superb venue and team! They made sure we had everything we needed on the day and we’re just so kind and helpful leading up to the wedding. They answered all our queries super quickly and the whole day just felt like a breeze!
V279,Hayne House,Hayne House is a beautiful wedding venue with a amazing team of staff! They supported us every step of the way and made sure everything ran smoothly on the day. They go above and beyond to make sure everything is perfect. I would especially recommend Hayne House if you have children as they are free to play the entire day! We had so many comments from guests about how beautiful the venue is and how amazing the staff are.
V279,Hayne House,"The team have curated a flawless operation at Hayne House which is so clear. The team ensured the day ran seamlessly and were amazing throughout the day and also during the lead up to our wedding which made it so stress-free and easy for us! There was not one thing that we needed to worry about on the day, the team handled EVERYTHING!! We had the best day and we're so pleased we chose Hayne House for our wedding, it was perfect!"
V279,Hayne House,"Had our wedding at Hayne House in June 2023- cannot fault a single thing with the team, services or facilities. Am so glad we chose Hayne House and would recommend to anyone wanting to get married stress free with a fantastic team who truly take the pressure off of wedding planning and are extremely flexible with requests and adjustments. Very good value for money and honestly all expectations were exceeded! Everything was well thought of and planned, there were no surprises and communication was excellent from the moment we made initial contact. Was such a special and memorable day due to the efforts and high quality of care and services at Hayne House."
V279,Hayne House,"As soon as we saw Hayne House we knew it was the perfect venue. The team are so welcoming and lovely. To the lead up to the big day they helped with everything. On the big day they may us feel at ease. I cannot recommend this venue enough, all of our guests said what a beautiful venue it is. They made our day so special, we enjoyed every little bit of it, thank you to all the team!"
V280,Bradbourne House,"My son had his wedding at Bradbourne House, the venue was beautiful, the staff were so helpful from start to finish, food was absolutely amazing, the toastmaster was a credit to the venue making this a day him and his new wife will never forget I would thoroughly recommend Bradbourne House for a wedding venue."
V280,Bradbourne House,"We had our reception here from the moment we arrived we were looked after and our guests were well informed. Hannah was fantastic and made our evening run smoothly and nothing was too much for her, she even helped me with my dress before my first dance and always asked if I was okay. Lauren was our first point of contact and she is lovely as is Rebecca. Thank you all so much. I would definitely recommend Bradbourne house not just for its beauty and privacy but for its team too."
V280,Bradbourne House,"On Saturday 27th October 2018 Julie and I had our renewal of Vows celebration at Bradbourne house, from our initial contact with Lauren at the Wedding Fair to the tasting menu to the day itself was a professional and dedicated service.

Bradbourne House has understood our requirements and ensured that the delivery of these were met without fuss or bother.

The food delivered from the Head Chef from Canapes to Wedding Breakfast to the Hog roast in the evening was first class.

The day itself ran like clockwork and the staff were again professional in their duties to ensure that all our guests were looked after.

It was a 5 star experience and we are already booking for our milestone birthdays in the next year or so.

A special thanks to Lauren and Head Chef who went beyond the call of duty to make it that special."
V280,Bradbourne House,"To all the fabulous staff and Bradbourne House, thank you so very much for your wonderful wedding organisation, wine knowledge, kitchen and food skills and ability to put on a great day as a team. You are all fantastic and a real asset to your employers. We are so very glad that we chose you as our venue. A no hassle and pleasant experience from start to finish. Wonderful! Thank you!"
V280,Bradbourne House,"From start to finish, Bradbourne House was wonderful in delivering the most perfect wedding reception for us. The house and gardens are absolutely beautiful and give you a great amount of space. What really made it was the staff. Everyone from the events team who worked with us for months beforehand, to the fantastic team on the day who thought of everything we hadn't and were there whenever we needed them. It meant we were free to enjoy the company of our guests and not worry about a thing. Perfect day and can't recommend it enough for a dream wedding venue."
V280,Bradbourne House,"To all at Bradbourne House.

Just a big thank you for making the Wedding of Paul and David such a memorable day. The venue was delightful and everything you did made it the most wonderful occasion. Everyone said it was the best wedding they had ever attended! The weather, the setting, the staff and the food was absolutely perfect.

So as the mother of Paul i thank you so much for a day to remember, it was absolutely flawless.
Thank you all again."
V280,Bradbourne House,Just a little note to say a big thank you for making our day run so smoothly. It all went perfectly for us and everybody was so complimentary of Bradbourne House.
V280,Bradbourne House,"To all at Bradbourne... thanks so much for making it a super special day for me and Emma. Your whole team was superb, especially Charlotte, and made the day very easy for us. We had so many nice comments from guests about the venue, the food and the staff. A few pics as requested!"
V280,Bradbourne House,"We just wanted to say a massive thank you to all of you and the fantastic team that helped make the day special!
The staff and service were all exceptional and nearly all the guests commented on the high standard of service and professionalism of your team. Food... Amazing!!

Thank you all so much. You took the pressure off before and during the wedding and delivered to us a day that no one will forget for a long time to come."
V280,Bradbourne House,"I attended Bradbourne House on Saturday 18th June for my cousin wedding.

I am unable to eat wheat/gluten so passed this on to the bride and groom beforehand.

I am just getting in touch to say how great your staff were at facilitating my needs! The food was delicious and they made sure it was gluten free for me. In the evening fish and chips and bacon sandwiches were being served. I was unable to have the fish as covered in wheat but a very kind gentleman brought me out two bacon sandwiches in gluten free rolls. This was very much appreciated. I was also advised the chips were gluten free!

Thank you for being so accommodating. It is much appreciated!"
V281,Westerham Golf Club,"We cannot express how grateful and happy we were with Westerham Golf Club. All of the staff were amazing and our event managers made sure we were always kept up to date and incredibly quick to reply (even though we bombarded them with our silly questions!) They made us feel so at ease and took care of all the little details they we didn't even think of! The food was delicious and they ensured that everyone was catered for. If you want a beautiful, seamless wedding experience, Westerham Golf Club is the place to book!"
V281,Westerham Golf Club,"Everything about this venue was just perfect. From our first visit up until our wedding date, the team at Westerham were so helpful and always on hand to answer any questions. On the day, the team had everything under control and the whole day went smoothly - not to mention the incredible views!"
V281,Westerham Golf Club,"We honestly cannot recommend Westerham Golf Club enough as a wedding venue! From the moment we first reached out to inquire, the team made everything so easy and stress-free. The events manager and the coordinating team were absolute professionals, and they went above and beyond to ensure that our big day was flawless.

Everything about the day was incredibly well-organised. From the ceremony to the reception, everything flowed so seamlessly. We didn’t have to worry about a single thing as the team had every detail covered. It was amazing to be able to relax and enjoy the moment, knowing that the entire team had everything under control.

The venue itself is absolutely stunning, with beautiful views and a warm, welcoming atmosphere. The level of care and attention the staff gave us was exceptional. The events manager was always there to offer support and guidance, and they were just so kind and approachable. The entire team worked in perfect harmony, and their professionalism shone through at every step.

Our guests had an unforgettable time, and I’m so grateful to the team at Westerham Golf Club for making our wedding day so memorable. If you’re looking for a wedding venue that offers top-tier service, incredible organisation, and a beautiful setting, Westerham Golf Club is the perfect choice!"
V281,Westerham Golf Club,"We visited many venues before deciding on Westerham. What stood out right away was how lovely and welcoming the staff were on that initial visit, they really made us feel like no question was too silly to ask. And of course the setting - we initially wanted an outdoors wedding but knew that there'd be the risk of bad weather, so it was important any outdoor venue would have a great indoor backup. With Westerham, you can't have an outdoor wedding, but the indoor setting, with wide open windows revealing the beautiful landscaped golf course in all directions, meant it was like an outdoor wedding anyway. And it was just as well because on the actual wedding day, there were quite high winds! The team there were so helpful and patient throughout the whole year of planning, and on the day itself. They really put our minds at ease and were really flexible with some of our requests. The reception rooms are great - the smaller one for the ceremony was just the perfect size for our 100 guests, and the larger room for the wedding breakfast and evening celebration was spacious with room to eat, to dance, and to sit to catch your breath. The golf course is a wonderful setting to go out and get your formal photos and some video shot. It's fun to take some of the golf carts up into the wooded area and a chance to have some private moments with your new spouse. It's such a beautiful setting, we would recommend if you can afford it to include some drone footage, for your wedding video because it allows such a great view of the course, the buildings and water features. The food was excellent, in particular the lamb shank, and such huge portions that we struggled to eat a lot later in the evening at the buffet supper. Well worth paying the small extra supplement to allow 2 menu choices plus a veggie/vegan option. They also managed a few tricky dietary requirements really well including Halal and some fairly unique food allergies. Our formal proceedings were capped off by a fireworks display out on the golf course which made for some amazing pictures and video and if you can afford it, we would recommend it. Many guests said it was their favourite part of the evening and a real surprise. We couldn't be happier with our decision to be married here and it's hard now to imagine us getting married at any of the other venues we looked at. You will have a wonderful day no matter what time of year or whatever your theme."
V281,Westerham Golf Club,Amazing staff and amazing place. Loved every minute of my big day. They put in all the effort in to your big day. They made sure the day was perfect
V281,Westerham Golf Club,"Amazing experience from start to finish!
Fell in love with the venue the day we went and viewed it! It was all we imagined!
Gracie was Amazing the whole way through until the big day for us!
I honestly wish I could relive the day!

The day from start to finish is all we ever dreamed off! And I couldn’t recommend this venue enough and the team!"
V281,Westerham Golf Club,"When we began our wedding venue search, our main criteria were:

- good proximity to airport for international guests
- ceremony and reception at the same place, without the need to exit / reset
- no preferred supplier limitations
- kitchen on site (no need to hire externally)
- natural materials, like wood and brick, barn aesthetic
- indoor space we'd be happy not to leave in bad weather
- can have live music with no formal noise limiter
- experienced & supportive team
- budget

Westerham Golf Club delivered all of this and so much more. As soon as we visited the venue for the first time and spoke to the team we were confident we found our venue.

We were assigned a contact person straight away who answered all of our questions by email and phone conversations and was always unbelievably helpful and quick to respond.

In the lead up to the day we met our wedding day coordinators who we were reassured were very on the ball. We had a lot of personal details and touches throughout the day and never felt that we had to remind any of the team about them, they all understood the vision and knew all the intricate details of the day. They delivered them all without fault.

The venue on the day looked absolutely stunning. The exposed brick and beams in the Valence Suite make this feel like a cozy but expansive barn conversion, but with the benefit of the adjoining rooms, wrap around balcony and excellent facilities of the golf club. The views are spectacular and the tree-lined drive up to the venue really sets a great tone.

Throughout the day everything ran like clockwork, guests commented that the food was incredible and all of our suppliers worked with ease with the staff and facilities.

The team set up all our personal and homemade things for us and packed them all away again for easy collection the next morning - we are so so grateful for this!

The flow of the space is fantastic, we had our ceremony in the Eleanor Suite, then did confetti outside before re-entering the main space where the drinks reception were laid out and musicians performing. The bar area, sofas, dance floor and balcony were perfect for the canapes and drinks reception. We had photos on the grounds as well as in the lovely rose garden at the front of the venue. The dinner set up was there from the morning and had a real wow factor when guests first saw it. While Eleanor Suite was empty the chairs were quickly cleared and this became a breakout space where we laid out board games and guests could relax if they didn't want to be dancing with the band.

We got married in November and had a lot of evening guests, so having a space with plenty of room, without anyone needing to go outside (in case of cold/rain) was key and the venue was perfect in this regard. In the end we had a lovely clear day and guests really enjoyed being on the balcony.

I hope this review is helpful in helping other couples choose their venue. For us it was a dream come true and we cannot thank the team enough for delivering a perfect day!"
V281,Westerham Golf Club,"The lead up the wedding was great, Ella helped us with any little questions and made sure everything was sorted!

The day before we met the on the day manager Brad who talked us through the whole day and made sure we were happy with everything. Also when we walked in one of our suppliers hadn’t done what they were meant to - and the venue got on the phone to them right away to come back and sort it meaning the stress was off me!

The day came and it was a blur, but everything went smoothly, my guests couldn’t stop complimenting the venue and how gorgeous it was. Every detail was perfect and the food was amazing! The wine choices were a big hit and I couldn’t be more complimentary of the staff.

The only hiccup we had was when asking for a cup of tea for my Nan during the welcome drinks, and my brother was told they can’t do that by the bar, but my groom went up and it was sorted quickly.

Thanks westerham for a memorable day - that we will cherish always"
V281,Westerham Golf Club,"Westerham is a beautiful venue. The backdrop of the luscious green golf course and the building itself is amazing. The rose garden is the perfect place for a drinks reception - even the drive into the venue is cool!

Now to come onto the staff. Every single one of them couldn’t do enough for us. The communication at every step was faultless, and they are extremely helpful regardless of who you deal with! They are professional and can accommodate a whole variety of things, for example we asked for halal meat and they sourced it without any issue, no extra costs or anything. Their recommended suppliers are great, and they really make you feel at ease throughout the whole process and on the day.

The food is also VERY good. All of our guests were complimentary of that, as well as the decoration and table layout which is rustic and picturesque.

Having the licensed ceremony room in the same venue was perfect, as your guests can simply walk through the door into the wedding breakfast and evening reception room! The bar is well stocked, the wine selection was well received by our guests too.

We really can’t recommend Westerham enough. A few of my friends who were there are now considering it for their wedding venue, it’s that good and I found beat all others on price too!"
V281,Westerham Golf Club,"We made the best decision choosing Westerham Golf Club for our wedding venue. The staff went above and beyond, there are so many photo opportunities on the immaculately kept grounds, and the food was stunning! We had so many compliments from guests on what a fantastic venue we had chosen. The team made the whole wedding planning experience really straight forward, and were always in hand to answer any questions we had. Couldn’t recommend Westerham Golf Club enough!"
V282,The Old Kent Barn,"I could not be happier than we chose to have our wedding at The Old Kent Barn. The care and attention to detail the entire team put into everything they do is unmatched. The venue is absolutely stunning, and so many of our guests commented on how incredible it was. The food was amazing - so filling, tasted amazing and looked just as good. We had Sam as our wedding coordinator and she went above and beyond to ensure we had the best day of our lives. I'm so grateful that we found this venue - as it provided us with the most unforgettable day. Thank you TOKB!"
V282,The Old Kent Barn,"We had our wedding at The Old Kent Barn and couldn’t be happier with our experience. Everything was incredibly well planned and organised from start to finish. The staff were professional, attentive, and genuinely cared about making our day perfect. The venue itself is stunning, with beautiful grounds and a warm, welcoming atmosphere. It made for the most amazing setting for our ceremony and reception. We felt completely supported throughout the planning process and on the day itself. Highly recommend to any couple looking for a seamless and unforgettable wedding experience."
V282,The Old Kent Barn,"We would just like to give a huge heart felt thank you to all of the team at The Old Kent Barn.

We had our special day on a sun filled day on 3rd January 2025 surrounded by all our family and loved ones.
Our wedding was brought forward with 6 months due to doctors advice to my wife.

They couldn’t of been more helpful. Helped us through every step of the way and guided us through the entire process.

This was an absolute god send to my wife who is regularly in and out of Kings College Hospital.
The team took all the stress and worry from us and were always on hand in with any questions.
They were absolutely awesome. They are extremely well organised and ensured everything went well.

Our fairy tale wedding became a reality and we owe this to all the team.

We’d like to give an extra special shout out to Chloe, our wedding co-ordinator. You were awesome!
If anyone is looking for a venue for their special day then look no further than The Old Kent Barn.

You made our fairy tale wedding a reality and we’ll be forever grateful to you all."
V282,The Old Kent Barn,Myself and my husband married at the stunning Old Kent Barn in October and had the best day of our lives. The staff were amazing throughout the whole process from securing a date all the way to end day after the big day. Our wedding coordinator in particular Claire was just amazing and so helpful and resourceful. We would highly recommend the venue to anyone!
V282,The Old Kent Barn,"We got married at TOKB and it was flawless from the very first moment we’ve signed to the wedding day itself.

The whole process was very smooth and they have thought about every little detail. Their portal is very comprehensive and they help you to plan your wedding and make sure you cover every aspect of your day.

They really do go above and beyond and they run the wedding almost military style (in a good way!). They make sure you are on track without being pushy. Everything is done seamlessly and in the background. You never know they are there!

The venue is fantastic and there’s very little you need to do to decorate. It’s just down to individual themes and table decorations. It allows you to take great photos as the venue and the gardens are beautiful.

The food was great. The portions were massive and it tasted great. You won’t be leaving the wedding being hungry.

All in all, they have thought about everything, including the tiniest details. Even at the end of the night, the have made sure that there was some evening food left for us in our bedroom.

We’ve had a great wedding at TOKB and we are very grateful to the venue and the staff for making it perfect."
V282,The Old Kent Barn,"I would recommend TOKB to every single couple out there! They are more than just a venue - the staff here cater to you as if you are family, and gave us the wedding day of our dreams! Each staff member goes above and beyond to ensure your day is perfect, and you get a wedding coordinator who basically ensures everything on the day goes smoothly. They took all the burden of the stress so my partner and I could just be present and enjoy our day. I’m so glad we chose the Old Kent Barn, as my partner and I know not every venue is as thorough and caring as them (from stories from our friends and family about their weddings). Thank you TOKB - we love you!!"
V282,The Old Kent Barn,We chose TOKB as our wedding venue and never once regretted our decision. They have been incredibly supportive through our plethora of questions and thoroughly looked after us from enquiry and beyond the big day. Every single member of staff works extremely hard - from grounds keepers to kitchen staff to bar staff to wedding coordinators - you name it! Nothing is too much trouble for anyone there as they purely want you to have the most special experience with them. I cannot recommend them enough!
V282,The Old Kent Barn,"The Old Kent Barn was the most perfect venue! From the moment my now husband and I went for our first viewing right through until after the wedding the staff at the venue have been amazing - Ashleigh was our wedding coordinator and could not have been more helpful and on the day she was an absolute star and went well beyond her role in helping do things to ensure the day ran smoothly. The venue is STUNNING and the staff set everything up for you so that you can have the most relaxed wedding morning! Our guests could not speak more highly of the food - it was delicious and the chefs team were really accommodating with special requests and dietary needs and allergies etc! My husband and I had the most special wedding day and I highly recommend The Old Kent Barn, you will not regret choosing this as your wedding venue!"
V282,The Old Kent Barn,"We got married at the Old Kent Barn this week. From the minute we first enquired, to the tour, booking, planning, and wedding day were all perfect and so well organized. The staff all go above and beyond and we could not have been any happier. They make the planning process so easy, and we're always there is we needed assistance. The venue is gorgeous, so well maintained, the gardens especially are always being worked on and are gorgeous, we especially loved the pond and ducks!! I would not have changed a thing. The food was brilliant we went for a BBQ and had SO many compliments from our guests, the canapes, deserts and evening food were all amazing as well. Thank you so much for making our day perfect."
V282,The Old Kent Barn,"A week on from our wedding and I’ve come to the conclusion that there are no sufficient words to describe our experience at the barn.
From the minute we booked, the team have been brilliant. They are so responsive, they never leave you waiting for an answer when you email. They are positive, supportive and, most importantly, kind!

I have listened to the podcast ‘The Unfiltered Bride’ for most of the wedding planning and they encourage booking a ‘day of’ coordinator as wedding venues don’t provide the support you need. I can promise, with all my heart, you do not need one at TOKB. I had worried that we’d made a mistake not booking one, but boy did they prove me wrong.
They had at least two people checking on us throughout the morning as well as someone else for my husband, who helped with ties and getting them ready. Yes they were there to coordinate everything from the venue POV, but I did not feel ignored or that I was missing an extra person to help. They were on hand to help get me into my dress, to make sure my bridesmaids were ready. If you listen specifically to episode 74 of ‘The Unfiltered Bride’, everything listed during that episode as something a ‘day of’ coordinator does, is everything the team at TOKB did.

The food at TOKB is sublime. We had the hog roast for wedding breakfast and pizza for the evening. Our guests loved everything about it all, including the canapés. They took all dietary requirements we had in their stride and no-one went hungry.

I could gush about them for hours, they really are excellent."
V283,Leez Priory,"I never in my life thought I would get married in a place like Leez priory! The whole experience from start to finish was just fantastic. The price breakdown was manageable and there was no pressure to take any upgrades offered. The things we got in our package were phenomenal and having a wedding planner was tremendous - our lady (Leanne) was an absolute god send!
They catered to all our needs and we were made to feel so comfortable and nothing was a problem! I’d highly suggest going to an event there before hand, just to get a feel of what it’s like full of people and enjoy their delicious food. We actually enjoyed their entertainer ( singer) so much we hired him for our wedding ☺️
Lee priory is just so beautiful. I can’t speak highly enough x"
V283,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory on the 7th of September 2024. Considering how long they have been a wedding venue, they were pretty flexible with some of the ideas we had for the venue styling that turned out amazingly!

The staff really made the day something special and couldn't have done enough for us. Special mention must be made for Leanne, our wedding planner, who was amazing!

Highly recommend the venue and the incredible team that helped to make our day so special!"
V283,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in October 2024. This venue is stunning both inside and out with immaculately kept grounds and interior. The hospitality in the lead up to and on the day of the wedding was fantastic. The food was also brilliant. Another great perk of this venue is the amount of on site accommodation.

A couple of drawbacks / experiences during our wedding. There are only a few toilets in the main building which kept blocking and overflowing throughout the evening which led to us taking some guests to the dressing room or honeymoon cottage to use the facilities. You are also restricted by the venue on any external food or drink suppliers and the venues optional extras for this are quite expensive for what they are.

That asaide, we had the best day and evening at Leez Priory and would certainly recommend it!"
V283,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in August 2024- great venue and experience from initial viewing to leaving the morning after the wedding. Leanne acted as our wedding planner and was friendly, professional and helpful throughout. We opted for the classic package and the food was amazing quality with everyone commenting how full they were!
The venue is beautiful with several options for ceremony both inside and out. Accommodation was great too. The whole day ran smoothly with perfect weather - we will have very happy memories of our day!"
V283,Leez Priory,"Perfect venue and very attentive staff, lovely food and great communication from start to finish"
V283,Leez Priory,"Stunning venue. Fantastic Team. Very accommodating toward our unique ""surprise"" strategy. Our guests were truly surprised. Thank you."
V283,Leez Priory,"Leez priory was the 1st and only venue we looked around when we started planning our wedding. From the moment we stepped on the premises, everything just looked so perfect and exactly what we wanted from a wedding venue. When we got assigned our wedding co-ordinator Rachel, she was just absolutely spot on with everything we asked for and nothing was too big an ask for her. She made sure the day ran as smoothly as possible and took care of any issue that arose without me knowing (which I am forever grateful for!!)
The rest of the staff were amazing and very helpful.

The venue itself is just absolutely stunning and we loved that it has the pub area as well as the dance floor so it catered to all of our guests.

All of the rooms were lovely and it was so nice being able to stay in the fisherman’s lodge onsite the night before the wedding.

We genuinely cannot recommend this venue enough and it was 100% worth the money! 10/10!"
V283,Leez Priory,"We got married on a Tuesday in October to maximise the value of what we could get for our money; and honestly, we got everything we wanted and more. Leanne, our Wedding Manager was perfect at bringing an attention to detail and seamless organisation to the big day, and in the lead up. There wasn't one moment of the day where we felt stressed, as Leanne had it covered. In one particular instance, our flowers for the bridal party's hair hadn't arrived. Within five minutes of telling Leanne that we needed this, the flowers were with our hair and make-up suppliers to add the finishing touches.

Leez Priory as a venue is the most stunning setting, and offers an incredible range of areas in which the ceremony and reception can take place. There is also the opportunity for the bridal party to make use of the Fisherman's Cottage the night before the wedding, and for people to stay in the on-site accommodation on the evening of the wedding, making it the perfect venue for people also travelling from further afield.

Leez Priory were very accommodating, welcoming and were happy to work with us to make our day as perfect as possible. The food was incredible, and a total hit with all of our guests, and so many people have commented on how incredible the day was as a whole. You wouldn't be disappointed to choose Leez Priory."
V283,Leez Priory,They catered to our every need. To when we would ask for things they hadn’t been done before they still made sure it went smoothly. Leanne was amazing she made me feel so comfortable from the start. The whole day was stunning. Beautiful venue please go view it as you will not be disappointed
V283,Leez Priory,We got married on the 26 May 2024. This venue was absolutely brilliant! They catered for every need and made sure there was no stress on the day. Leanne was kind and level headed throughout and was always one step ahead! Do not hesitate to book- do it now!
V284,Chilston Park,"It’s taken me a while to write this review because it’s hard to put into words how magical my experience with Chilston Park has been. We originally came to Chilston on a whim knowing they had a wedding fair on. The drive up to the hotel is stunning, we were then greeted by Jane, the loveliest and most helpful bundle of joy, Jane became our wedding co ordinator and held my hand every step of the way, we went to every wedding fair from booking last February until our wedding day New Year’s Eve just gone and every time the staff made us feel like family that was visiting. On our day, unfortunately, Jane couldn’t be there but I knew the whole wedding team by then and had no worries that the day would go swimmingly with the amazing Ella, nothing was too much, nothing was answered with no and potential issues were resolved by the time I heard about them. Ella went above and beyond to ensure our day was flawless. Matt, another wonderful human who made it his business to make sure all guests were fed and watered, completed tasks that arose with the biggest smile and again nothing was too much to ask. Multiple guests commented on the efficiency of the staff and great attitudes. We have since been to a sister hotel of Chilston and it really goes to show that everyone can have the same training but the staff truly make a hotel, Chilston is second to none. The venue speaks for itself but these words are for the team because everyone bounced into work, got excited to see us and made us feel like royalty. Paul is clearly a great manager to his team, an absolute asset to Handpicked hotels and a lovely smiley face who even came in on his day off and wished us well. If you’re reading this and looking for a venue, book it, you won’t regret it! We had exclusive use which was great value for money for what it included. The best experience, the best team and the most beautiful venue x"
V284,Chilston Park,"We were so pleased to have had our wedding at Chilston. As soon as we saw the venue, it felt right for us. Its a beautiful venue inside and out. The staff are all excellently trained. From the reception staff, through to the waiting team, through to our wedding coordinator - everyone we met was excellent. We got married off site at a church and were delayed getting back to start our reception at Chilston, but the team were so flexible and made it seem no bother at all. We had such a wonderful day and are looking at being able to go back and stay and Chilston for our anniversary!"
V284,Chilston Park,"We couldn't have asked for more with our wedding at Chilston Park. From the initial booking to the details meeting and then finally the wedding day, everything was pretty much seamless. The wedding day itself went like clockwork and the staff worked so hard to make sure that everything was in place and everyone was in the right place at the right time! All of our guests loved the setting, the food and thought the staff were wonderful. We had a truly wonderful wedding day and that was thanks to the team at Chilston Park/"
V284,Chilston Park,"We viewed lots of potential wedding venues but from the moment we arrived at Chilston Park we just knew it was the place we wanted to hold our wedding. Chloe Rees guided us through the different room options of where we could hold our wedding ceremony as well as have our reception, no question went unanswered and the hotel was very accommodating in helping us deliver our two day dream wedding. Chloe, Paul The Manager and all the staff were fantastic from the start and on the wedding day. Chef, Ali delivered exquisite food for us and our guests, with friends and family still praising it months after. We have been back a few times for afternoon tea and evening meals with all the staff greeting us with such warmth. We have no hesitation in recommending the Chilston Park wedding team and this stunning country setting."
V284,Chilston Park,"Olly and I just wanted to extend our thanks to everyone at Chilton Park for making our wedding on Friday 7th of March 2025 it was so incredible.


Sophie was the first person we spoke to and she made the booking process seamless. She was so helpful in ensuring everything was arranged before her holiday and we are incredibly grateful for her.

The day before the wedding, I had the pleasure of meeting Ella and Ellie, who went above and beyond to assist us. They were both attending our wedding and were genuinely amazing. Ella made our day so special—she took care of everything from cutting the cake to moving things around, so we didn’t have to worry about a thing. She was truly outstanding. Ellie, working behind the bar, was equally fantastic, always with a smile on her face and everyone absolutely adored her.

We can’t thank them enough for making our day unforgettable. Even the morning after the wedding, when we came down for breakfast, Ella was there to greet us with a big smile and get everything ready for us.

Olly and I are already looking forward to returning to Chilton Park when our little one arrives. What a wonderful way to start March!

Thank you again to everyone at Chilton Park, and we hope to see you all again soon.

Best wishes,

The Yeomans!"
V284,Chilston Park,"We got married at Chilston Park in August, and it was nothing short of perfection. We opted for the exclusive use package, which catered to every need. Most of our guest list were international guests, and being able to host everyone comfortably under one roof for the full weekend was incredible. From the food to the helpful staff and gorgeous grounds, I highly recommend choosing Chilston Park for your wedding if you are looking for English elegance. Thank you to the full team who made our dream wedding weekend possible! Big shout out to Sophie for helping us plan for over a year and a half!"
V284,Chilston Park,"We honestly couldn't have wished for any more.
The professionalism and attention to detail was immaculate.
Even though we were a small wedding we were never made to feel less than anyone else."
V284,Chilston Park,"We have just had our special day, and all I can say is from the moment we looked around to the day after the wedding we was well looked after, we had a designated person to speak about our wedding and all our needs were met with no questions asked. The venue and the grounds are stunning, the bedrooms are beautiful and our day was so perfect, I couldn’t fault anything. I just wish we could do it all over again. I would highly recommend Chilston Park as a wedding venue."
V284,Chilston Park,"If you are considering Chilston Park Hotel for your wedding venue let me put your mind at ease.

We got married in Chilston park hotel on the 14th January 2024 and it was the best day of our lives. All our guests are still messaging and calling us telling us what a fantastic time they had, how beautiful the ceremony and the venue are, how through the day they were never hungry and that the food really was amazing.

Although the venue may be second to none it was the staff for me who really make this venue special, the attention to detail is exceptional. From the moment we attended the venue for an open day Jane our event organiser was amazing, Jane always made time to speak to us and communication was always very prompt and very accommodating where she could be. Jane really made the whole process very easy and stress free even with only having a year to plan it all.

On the day of the wedding the team at the venue were nothing short of exceptional. Matt was our point of contact on the day I approached Matt early that morning with a few tasks and like a mind reader had assured me everything had already been taken care of. The day ran faultlessly, it became clear from the beginning of the day that the staff have it down to a fine art which allowed us to just enjoy the day.

I cannot commend or recommend this venue highly enough, thank you again to Jane and Matt and all the staff at Chilston Park Hotel for the day of our lives."
V284,Chilston Park,"Excellent service, made our wedding day a really special memory. Beautiful food, always willing to help us with advice and effort throughout our day. Would recommend for no fuss professional and enjoyable day."
V285,Eastwell Manor,"My husband and I got married at Eastwell Manor in October 2024, and it was everything we dreamed of and more. From the moment we arrived, we were swept away by the breathtaking grounds, the elegant manor, and the warm, welcoming staff who made us feel like royalty.

The entire day was simply magical. The ceremony setting was so romantic – full of charm and character – and the reception felt like something out of a dream. Every detail was perfectly taken care of, and we didn’t have to worry about a thing. The staff were so friendly and helpful, and they truly went above and beyond to make sure everything ran smoothly.

We can't thank the Eastwell Manor team enough for making our wedding so unforgettable. If you’re thinking about getting married here – do it! It’s the most magical, romantic, and beautiful venue you could ask for.

With all our love,
Mr & Mrs Clarke 💕✨"
V285,Eastwell Manor,"My husband and I married here in April 2024. The venue was stunning and guests were impressed with their rooms. The toast master Jim is highly recommended. He really brought the energy into the wedding.
Highly recommended."
V285,Eastwell Manor,"We got married in August 2024 and we had the most stress-free and beautiful wedding. It was raining on the day and our Plan A was for the ceremony to be outside, but on the day it had to be changed to Plan B. The Eastwell Manor team handled the change of plans with such ease, I didn't have to worry about a thing and the end result was better than our original plan! The wedding coordinators at Eastwell Manor are incredibly organised and professional. Jim, the Toastmaster, is an absolute delight and really brought the crowd together. The food was excellent and the tent outside was beautiful at night. We had a beautiful day and are eternally grateful to the team at Eastwell manor for looking after us so well. The rooms are stunning to stay in and the bridal suite is absolutely gorgeous to get ready in with your bridesmaids."
V285,Eastwell Manor,"We would like to say a massive Thankyou to Eastwell and their fantastic team which made our wedding day truly special and unforgettable!
From the first visit we knew Eastwell was the perfect venue for us, from the great layout of the venue to its fantastic facilities, beautiful rooms and ceremony spaces.
The wedding team were all amazing, professional and so friendly and nothing was too much trouble.
Everything organised quickly yand efficiently through email and were always very accommodating and flexible.
We really appreciate everybody’s hard work which made our day the best of our lives!"
V285,Eastwell Manor,"After getting engaged on my 40th birthday, we decided we wanted a Christmas wedding and wanted to plan it within a year. We had Eastwell Manor as one of our venue choices and after viewing it in December 23 (when it was decorated for Xmas) we completely knew it was ‘the one!’. Throughout the year of planning, Dawn and Helen were amazing. Responded to emails etc quickly, helped wherever needed, and it was lovely to have a menu tasting session in a private room. I stayed in the bridal suite the night before. A few of us had dinner in the bar which was very relaxing. The room/suite was beautiful. The bath was amazing (see photos) and I had a lovely morning getting ready for the day ahead. Our wedding was so special. To be surrounded by our guests in such a fabulous venue so beautifully decorated for Christmas, it was magical. Everyone said how great it was. The food taste delicious and was presented well. All the staff were so friendly and helpful. My husband and I stayed in the bridal suite that night and it was just great. I would 100% recommend this venue. Id also recommend a Christmas wedding as the atmosphere is something else. Thanks again Eastwell Manor, Dawn and the team, you are amazing 🤩 Love Mr & Mrs Smith (22.12.24) 🎄 xx"
V285,Eastwell Manor,"We got married at Eastwell Manor in May and honestly, it was the perfect day from start to finish! The venue is absolutely stunning — the grounds, the house, everything just felt like a fairytale. The staff were incredible and made us feel so relaxed and looked after the entire time. They really went above and beyond to make sure everything ran smoothly. The food was amazing, the setup was beautiful, and all our guests were raving about the whole experience. We couldn’t have picked a better place to say “I do”. Massive thanks to everyone at Eastwell Manor — you helped make our day so special and we’ll treasure it forever!"
V285,Eastwell Manor,"We visited Eastwell Manor when looking for venues and instantly fell in love with it. The grounds are so impressive and the inside very homely and comfortable. The wedding team are extremely helpful and professional and helped make our day perfect. The rooms are all lovely, particularly in the manor house and all guests were very happy with them. Particular thanks to Helen, Dawn, Tracey and Chris for the lead up to our big day and for coordinating our day so well without any issues. The food tasting was amazing and had a real personal touch and the food was very well executed on the day with no delays and again our guests have been saying how much they enjoyed it. Our toastmaster Jim was fantastic and also ensured our day went perfectly. Thank you to all of those behind the scenes in the kitchen and the efficient staff who assisted with the wedding breakfast and bar in the evening. Would highly recommend this venue."
V285,Eastwell Manor,"Really lovely venue, the whole day went really smoothly and big thanks to Jim who did an amazing job MCing and corralling the crowd when needed. Really made the day run smoothly, everyone had an awesome time."
V285,Eastwell Manor,"After postponing our wedding and even losing our original venue due to Covid, we knew that finding an alternative that we loved just as much was going to be tough. Eastwell Manor is every bit as beautiful as the photos suggest, and after visiting, we knew we’d found the perfect place for us immediately.
The Maid’s Garden fit our dreams of an outdoor ceremony perfectly with its ivy-lined walls, manicured lawns, pond and Italian gazebo. The terrace with its views overlooking the endless grounds was the ideal space for our reception drinks and canapés, especially on a blue-skied day in June. The wood-panelled Rose Garden Room made the perfect setting for an intimate wedding breakfast with 80 of our closest friends and family. The room was transformed for the evening reception with fairy lights (put up very kindly, and at short notice, by the venue staff) candles and a DJ, with the neighbouring Chaucer Room serving as our bar and a slightly more relaxed setting for our guests. During the evening we also held a barbecue on the terrace as the sun went down with plenty of food for everyone to enjoy.
It’s worth adding that with so much accommodation available in the Manor House and Mews, it really had the feel of a destination wedding. Friends and family were able to stay on-site for a long weekend, giving us the chance to celebrate with them the night before and all enjoy the fabulous spa facilities the day after.
We can’t emphasise enough that all of this was made possible by the outstanding team at Eastwell Manor, who literally could not have done anything more to ensure that we had the best day of our lives. They really did go above and beyond and made us both feel as if the entire hotel was our home for the day. This extends far beyond the exceptional wedding and events team. From the bar and waiting staff always happy and willing to help, to the reception staff that were on-hand at all hours and the incredible chefs that served the best wedding food we have ever had (our guests still talk about the beef!). Helen and Jasmine were a dream to work with, being flexible with all of our requests and doing everything they could to make sure that all of our ideas were realised on the day. A special mention has to go to Chris - an absolute asset to the Eastwell team, he worked tirelessly to ensure everything went without a hitch on the day, and all while looking cool, calm and collected. You really are in excellent hands with this team!
We cannot thank the whole team at Eastwell Manor enough, they gave us our dream wedding day and we wholeheartedly recommend them to everyone!

This put us both and our guests at ease to enjoy every moment."
V286,The Barn,"I cannot thank everyone at The Barn enough for making our wedding day the best day of our lives. It's hard to put into words how perfect everything was. From start to finish every detail was well thought out, every change of plan and sudden request was catered for and throughout you knew you were in safe hands. The venue is beautiful, staff are incredibly friendly, polite and helpful. Food and drink is amazing. The list goes on and on. All I can say again, is Thank You. Cannot recommend highly enough!"
V286,The Barn,"We recently had our wedding at The Barn and from the moment we contacted Philippe we couldn’t have asked for a better experience. With only 4 months between booking and event it was great that communication and planning with Janet was easy, flexible, timely and supportive – from our plans with various music playlists needed on different sound systems to arranging our rehearsal the day before, all the little details were accommodated.

The location of The Barn is really accessible being in the centre of town, with plenty of places for guests to stay nearby, yet it feels very private as it is set away from the main road down a private street with no passing traffic. It is a gorgeous venue, really intimate but with plenty of space for our 70 guests, and the team had done an excellent job of setting up and laying out our table decorations beautifully; it was a wonderful space for us to connect with our guests.

All the staff were professional, friendly and helpful throughout the event; many of our guests commented on how lovely they were, along with how fantastic the venue was.

The food was delicious, guests choose from 4 meals on each course, and every one of them looked amazing, we’ve heard many compliments of every option. Service throughout the meal was excellent, a good level of attentive, efficient and unobtrusive, they served a large room at a good pace.

The whole running of the day was done smoothly, changing areas worked really well, we hardly noticed the hard work going on downstairs while we had our meal.

We can’t thank the team at The Barn enough for helping us have such a wonderful day and we highly recommend this wonderful venue!"
V286,The Barn,"There’s no words to describe the barn or their team. If you haven’t already booked a wedding with them, do it, and don’t think twice!

Philippe and Janet are amazing, from our initial emails and queries, through to the booking and the meeting to discuss our options etc. We were presented with a lovely folder containing all of the information, and some sample menus - given plenty of choices to give to guests (allowed up to 4 of each for adults, and 2 of each for children - loads more flexibility than a lot of other venues)

We dropped off our decorations the day before, and it’s lovely to see local businesses working together to support each other and the area (they supply discount codes for local hotels), and the Hotel were happy for us to leave a car in the car park overnight before.

When I arrived at the venue, the team had decorated it just how we wanted it, with all of our name places out, activity packs, favours etc.

Nothing was too much trouble, we had vegetarians, coeliacs and allergies - all the food was impeccable. Every single person commented on how great their sea bass was, or how tender (and huge!) the rack of lamb was, it’s safe to say they catered for everyone (gluten free ice cream, gluten free bread rolls etc). Even catered for a vegetarian child at short notice !

Their house DJ (Luke Swift) did a great job too, keeping the music flowing and people up on their feet - a real crowd pleaser.

The bar staff, were incredible - smiles all round, enjoying the day as much as we were - making it extra special.

The sweet cart, patisserie selection and cheese tower looked great too (even supplied gluten free crackers for that too)!

Philippe, Janet, Andrew, Jack & Toby (and the rest of the back of house team), thank you so much for making our day so memorable, every single one of our guests said how great they day was, and you’ve even secured a few new restaurant customers (from as far as Greenwich) who are coming back as they want to taste the other food options 😂!!"
V286,The Barn,"We had our wedding here in November & ourselves & all of our guests had the best day. The staff were nothing short of amazing, so attentive & really couldn’t do enough for you. The food was brilliant, everyone said how they enjoyed every course & the evening buffet too! You got to choose out of a big list per course, so you could give your guests 4 options per course to choose from which is very very rare with wedding breakfasts! It really is such a beautiful & intimate venue with exceptional prices. They decorated it perfectly, exactly how we imagined. We dropped 5+ boxes off the night before & a description of how we’d like everything & the staff did it perfectly. Not one thing was wrong. We had outside suppliers for a couple of decor/sweet Cart items who failed to turn up, I found out as I was about to walk down the aisle so was upset and stressed. The Barn staff, especially Phillippe, sorted everything and to my surprise in the evening we had a stocked sweet table decorated downstairs for us & our guests, they really do go above & beyond for you. We have no complaints or reservations at all about this venue & would 100% recommend it to everyone. The ceremony room looked so pretty too, with the chairs covered & the pretty twig trees, we didn’t need any more decor in there than that, the orangery is such a pretty room on its own. As is the rest of the venue with gorgeous wooden beams, it can suit all sorts of wedding themes. Thank you to everyone at The Barn for making our special day, the best day ever!"
V286,The Barn,"Patrick and I had our wedding reception at the Barn on the 31st July 2022 and we could not have chosen a more perfect venue for our special day.
On viewing The Barn, we both instantly fell in love with this beautiful venue which is also in such a perfect location in the centre of Tunbridge Wells, so convenient for our guests, many of who would be staying in nearby hotels. Having a smaller wedding, we were also thrilled that we could have the exclusive use of the venue for the whole day which later proved to add to the relaxing atmosphere of the occasion.
Philippe was so friendly and helpful in guiding us with our choices which made everything so much easier and ensured all ran smoothly on the day.
Throughout the process, Janet was amazing too and always answered my questions promptly, nothing was too much trouble.
Like many couples who get married here, we had our photos taken in Calverley park, which is just across the road from the venue, again so convenient as we did not have to leave our guests for too long.
The food was delicious, and we had many compliments, it was also wonderful to be able to offer our guests individual menus from the various choices available, a feature I would not have previously thought was possible. The welcome canapes and the evening buffet were also very well received.
Luke Swift, the resident DJ, was great too and kept the dancers on their feet.
We are so pleased that we chose The Barn for our wedding and can not recommend this venue highly enough. We thoroughly enjoyed the day and all our guests had a fabulous time.
Dear Janet and Philippe, we so appreciate everything you did to make our day so special and one that we will always remember.
Thank you so much,
Christine & Patrick x"
V287,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","The best choice we made was having our wedding at the oak barn frame farm! Not only is the space gorgeous, but it's eco friendly, has lots of different options depending on preference and weather, and they have beautiful cottages for family and close friends to stay close and the option to spend the whole weekend at the farm! It was exactly what we were looking for! And the best part was the support! Chrystelle was amazing!! She helped us through the whole planning process and gave us the invaluable list of suppliers( who were all amazing!). She is such a professional and a wonderful person! She really went above and beyond making sure we had the best day (weekend) of our lives! Couldn't recommend this place more! If you're looking for a country wedding, you've found your place!"
V287,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","We had our wedding in October 2024 at the Oak Barn Frame Farm and we couldn’t have picked a more perfect venue! From the moment we looked around the barn, we both knew it was the place for us. Having 3 barns meant we were able to keep our 50 guests entertained and still have beautiful spaces. We weren’t sure what to expect with dry-hire, but the barn is so beautiful it could be kept minimal if you’re on a budget, but being able to personalise it to how we wanted it made it extra special for us. The open fields, waterfall and sheep meant we got some amazing photos (from our photographer Matt Birchall) as well as the best memories. Chrystelle couldn’t have been more helpful, from her communication in planning, to the materials provided in the run up to the wedding, and her excellent organisation on the day meaning our wedding ran seamlessly and we didn’t have to worry about anything. The list of trusted suppliers was great too, and we used quite a few who were also great. The accommodation on site was an added bonus for us and family, and all of our friends and family commented on what a perfect venue we’d chosen. Being environmentally focused was also a huge bonus for us, as it really aligned with our values. Thank you to all at the Oak Barn for giving us the happiest day!"
V287,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","It was an absolute joy to have our wedding at the oak barn - we had the most perfect day! The team were so responsive and helpful throughout the process - we loved working with Hayley and Chrystelle!

The spaces were all beautiful and a perfect balance of indoor and outdoor in case of rain! We had so many compliments on the venue throughout the day.

We loved how much we were able to personalise the venue - from setting up the wedding breakfast decorations from scratch to bottling up our own homemade cocktails to serve throughout the day. The onsite accommodation was spotless and felt so luxurious. It was fab for all our nearest and dearest to be so close and turned it from a day to a weekend of celebrations! Thank you so much to the oak barn for making it all so special!"
V287,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","We recently had our wedding at The Oak Barn and it was the perfect place. The barn and surroundings are absolutely beautiful, the fact you can spend the whole weekend there really makes the wedding feel special with plenty of time to set up and relax.
The team are amazing, really supportive in the run up and during the weekend and ready to help with whatever might arise!
Thank you for the best weekend ever."
V287,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","I cannot thank Oak Barn enough - you made everything absolutely PERFECT!!!

Thank you for your constant eye to detail, for keeping us in line and for your creative flare.

You managed expertly to make us all so relaxed on every level. Throughout this entire process you have been so diligent, always going the extra mile and always suggesting the most fun ideas - you really made all my dreams come true.

With our greatest thanks,
Chris and Alice"
V287,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","I honestly cannot stress enough how beautiful this venue is and how amazing the staff are. From the day we went to view the venue (and fell in love the second we drive down the drive) to the moment we left the day after our wedding the staff were always on hand for anything we needed. It’s great having the cottages on site as well, being able to stay the night before our wedding and the night of made life so much easier for us meaning we could get everything done the day before the wedding and I didn’t spend the morning stressing if everything was right. This venue is truly stunning and has so many different places for gorgeous photos. Thank you again Tim and Deana for allowing us to get married at your amazing venue. Emma and Elliot"
V287,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","It was great being able to stay from Friday till Sunday which made us all feel way more relaxed than trying to do everything in a day!
The three barns are wonderful each with its own unique charm and thing to offer.
The cottages were beautifully set out and offered us and our wedding party top end accommodation."
V287,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","From the first visit of the Oak Barn, I knew it was where I wanted to get married and it did not disappoint!
The booking process and the final details meeting run so smoothly, all of the staff are extremely helpful throughout they provide you with so much information to make your organising of the wedding so easy!
We booked Oak Barn for two nights along with Weavers Cottages, it was the best thing we did… our guests were able to settle in the day before and we had everyone round for drinks and nibbles the night before making our wedding so much fun! The cottages are so comfortable with every detail thought of… waking up to the sheep in the fields is just perfect!
Chrystelle was the best, she made sure we was happy at all times and made sure everything run so smoothly even appearing during my sons tantrum (toddler) in the middle of the ceremony with cookies to calm him down. After being awake in the middle of the night replanning our ceremony to be outside due to the fact I had both of my brothers giving me away and also how lucky we were with the fantastic weather!
Both members of staff who were there on the evenings to lock up the barns were so helpful and friendly and made it so easy for us!
The Oak Barn really is the most special venue, it is absolutely stunning down to every little touch! The memories we will have from the perfect wedding here will last forever for both us and our guests! Thank you to everyone at Oak Barn for making it so special!"
V287,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","From the moment we drove down the drive for the first time, until approximately six months later when we said I do, we knew this was the venue for us. We were blessed to have unexpectedly beautiful weather for April, the presence of the young lambs adding to the atmosphere and just the perfect day from start to finish.
We hired the venue for the weekend, to enable our wider family and guests to be part of our celebration and it really did take a huge amount of stress out of the actual day. The cottages are welcoming, of a high standard, and provide all that you need, although never did get to experience the copper bath!
The whole team are hugely supportive, encouraging, making you believe that anything is possible. Each wedding feels individual and personal, limited only by your imagination. We would whole heartedly recommend the Oak Barn and its recommended suppliers."
V287,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","We made the ultimate mistake of visiting this venue first when starting to plan our big day - no where else compared.

The views (& sheep!), the beautiful barn & Byre (a choice of indoor or outdoor ceremonies), well furnished cottages for all to stay & just a the perfect feel for a wedding.

They provided a list of recommended suppliers who have worked (& are trusted) at their venue which gave us a great starting point although they were more than accommodating for anyone new.

Very helpful in the run up in the day with compiling a complete run through of the day - with floor layouts, supplier details (& got in contact with each supplier on our behalf to ensure they were equipped with all the info for the day). Even on the day, Tim was great at resolving any small hiccups that appeared.

Huge thank you to Tim, Deana, Chrystelle, Tembo & all the behind the scenes team for making our day so special."

V289,The Vines of Rochester,"We had the most amazing wedding at The Vines! I would 100% recommend this wedding venue. The food, service, running of the day etc was all exceptional. All of our guests commented on how amazing the venue was"
V289,The Vines of Rochester,"We had the most amazing wedding day at The Vines of Rochester. The venue is absolutely beautiful, with so many gorgeous touches throughout.
The staff on the day and the build up were so helpful and accommodating, which meant the day ran so smoothly from start to finish.
We would definitely recommend anyone looking at The Vines as a potential wedding venue - we couldn't have wished for anything more!"
V289,The Vines of Rochester,"Our special day was perfect, and this is credit to the wonderful Vines venue and the amazing team led by Becky and Holly.

The venue is beautiful. So much character and style. We loved getting married in the tippe, very intimate. The dining room did not need a lot of dressing and flowers, some simple styling and the space looked amazing. We loved that there were multiple spaces for our guests to use, the bar area was lively and great for chatting while the dining rooms transformed to a generous dance floor. Then our closest friends and family were able to stay at the venue with us, to enjoy a yummy breakfast the next day.
The location, venue and setting is just perfect.

The whole experience with the Vines team was very professional and well organised. Questions were answered super promptly, with confidence from the super friendly team.
The supper tasting night was great, we were able to sample multiple starters and desserts, although keep an eye out and book early.
The pre wedding appointment went through every detail. There was nothing that they hadn’t considered and care was taken to tailor to our preferences, nothing was a problem.

On the day Becky and Holly were amazing, so attentive, supportive, brilliant ladies, they absolutely made the day with lots of complements from our guests on the high quality of the team. The food was outstanding, thank you to the culinary team.
The DJ was great, tailored to our music preferences and refused any off piste guest requests! Well looked after by the evening team.

We can’t thank you all enough for such a wonderful day."
V289,The Vines of Rochester,"From the initial visit to The Vines, we knew it was the perfect venue for us. The staff team were always on hand to help with any queries or logistical issues we had, answering all of our questions and the online portal was so easy to use. The pricing is clearly laid out and there aren't any hidden or added on costs later on. We mainly dealt with Holly on the lead up to the wedding, and Becky and Will on the day. They were all so helpful and supportive. They took care of a last minute crisis when the lady bringing our dog to be the ring bearer ended up stuck in traffic. Without us even knowing, they sent someone to go and help bring them to the venue on time. Nothing was too much trouble for them. The drinks...good luck deciding what package you want as they are all so delicious. We opted for the festival wedding which was so laid back, but still organised. The food was so good and the evening buffet was lovely. The DJ included liaised with us on the lead up to the wedding and worked with us to put together an idea of what we wanted and what would get people dancing, which worked perfectly. The rooms....there are so many to choose from to be your wedding suite. We opted for a garden room. We gave the others to guests travelling to the wedding and all of the rooms are so beautiful in their own unique way. Becky and Will were on hand all of our wedding day for us and our guests and anything we needed was taken care of without a fuss. The morning after we all had breakfast with our guests that stayed over and that was such a lovely extra touch to add to the wedding. Even the timings that the planners work out mean there are non rushed transitions of moving your items out and the next wedding bringing items in; you barely notice. Being able to store items there a few days before is a huge help! Also in the lead up to the wedding they invited us to a supper evening where we got to enjoy some of the lovely food on offer. In the portal there is also a section for selling and buying wedding items which is very helpful and convenient.
Honestly we couldnt have been happier with our choice of venue and have recommended it to friends that have since gotten engaged. Amazing venue and team x"
V289,The Vines of Rochester,"We instantly fell in love with The Vines, it was the perfect venue for us and we loved having a relaxed festival style wedding meaning we had more time to mingle with our guests. The wedding coordinators were friendly, accommodating and professional. We were in such good hands and were made to feel so special. It really was the best day. Thank you so much, Alex & Tom."
V289,The Vines of Rochester,"We were lucky enough to have held our wedding day at The Vines on 4th November 2023. From start to finish, the whole process was such a breeze. Their communication was always so speedy and thorough (which is what any bride wants). There were never too many small or big questions I could ask them, as they were always so happy to help. It was honestly such a stress free experience for us and they went above and beyond. I cannot thank them enough for everything. The venue, the rooms, the food, the staff… all faultless! We chose the ‘festival’ style wedding to suit us and our guests and we still have guests commenting now on what a fabulous day and experience it was. It was very different from any wedding we had attended, in the best way possible. If my husband would let me do it all again tomorrow, I would!"
V289,The Vines of Rochester,"We had a wonderful day with our friends and family. The venue is beautiful. Such amazing photo opportunities at the venue but also in Rochester with the castle and cathedral. everyone said how lovely it is. All the wedding co-ordinaters were wonderful, any problem or question was always dealt with promptly and professionally. Our venue will always have brilliant memories of our day."
V289,The Vines of Rochester,"We had our wedding here recently and wow what a venue! It’s such a pretty venue and so many of our guests commented on how lovely it is. It has amazing locations for photos, in the sunshine and rain! And we had a mixture of both on our day. But the best thing about the Vines has to be the team that work there. They couldn’t do enough for you. They made everything seem effortless, they were so kind and accommodating and we are so pleased we chose the Vines as our wedding venue. From Becky our duty manager on the day - who was absolutely fabulous and couldn’t have done more for us - to the bar staff, waiting staff, DJ and just everyone we encountered - they were all fabulous. Thank you so much!"
V289,The Vines of Rochester,"Venue is absolutely stunning.
Staff on the day were good & couldn’t do more.
Was sold on the basis we’d have a wedding portal to help us throughout - this is only for a traditional wedding. If having a festival wedding there is nothing.
Personally I felt alone & wasn’t confident until the meeting 8weeks before to go through plans for the day- I felt if anything was not ok it was late to make amendments.
As a second wedding I knew what I wanted but was chilled, however for some this may not be a good experience.

On the day - we had pre arranged a tab with conditions, thus didn’t seem to be adhered too. I had several decorations go missing & I got no response.

We received no contact after the wedding to ask for feedback or to ask if everything was ok"
V290,Solton Manor,"Solton Manor had everything that we dreamed of for our special day. The grounds are just beautiful, the Manor House is full of character and charm and the Dutch Barn definitely has the wow factor.
The team at Solton Manor deserve a special mention. From start to finish, Karen, Jackie and the team were professional, friendly, helpful, extremely hard working and nothing was ever too much trouble. They welcomed our sausage dog, Frankie who was a very important part of our day. A big 'woof' of thanks from him!!
Our guests loved staying in the Manor House and the pretty Dovecote Cottage. The facilities allowed us to make breakfast for our guests the day after which was an added bonus! The games room with a table tennis table was a real hit too!
Highly recommend this fantastic venue!"
V290,Solton Manor,"Our wedding was everything we wanted.
Karen and Jackie were there to help and had lots of ideas to make our dream come true.
We stayed in the Manor House and the Bridal Suite is stunning. The boys used the Games Room to get ready and the girls had the whole Dovecote to themselves.
Food was delicious too!
It was wonderful, thank you so much.
Lena and Christian"
V290,Solton Manor,"Solton Manor was the perfect setting for our special day in October 2023.
Karen and Jackie made us feel at ease and were super responsive with all the planning right from our very first contact.
The day itself was everything that we wanted it to be and would absolutely recommend this venue. Thank you, Abi and Josh"
V290,Solton Manor,"From the moment we arrived at Solton Manor, we knew it was the venue for us. We were met at the door of the historic Manor House and had a fabulous time hearing stories about the house, walking around the gorgeous gardens and visiting the wonderful Dutch Barn - we were already wedding planning!
Our Wedding was such a special weekend and we loved every minute of it.
The venue is magical and you have thought of everything to make it perfect.
Your attention to detail was incredible and your help was so supportive every step of the way.
It was as important to you as it was to us that the day was the day of our dreams and we just cannot believe how perfect it was. Thank you so much for everything. Mandy and Kevin"
V290,Solton Manor,From the booking o the planning to the actual wedding was all so amazing! The team truly went out of their way to make my day the most perfect day ever!

V290,Solton Manor,Shelley is so kind and helpful! The venue is stunning and I loved every minute of our wedding day there!
V290,Solton Manor,"We had our wedding in Oct2021 & Solton Manor was the perfect setting for our special day. Shelly handled the whole process from start to finish in such a friendly, helpful & efficient manner. Our wedding was postponed by 1 year due to COVID but Shelly made the whole process stress-free and she was always super responsive. We would thoroughly recommend this wedding venue!"
V291,The Darenth,"Our wedding experience was absolutely perfect! Everything was so well organised, and the staff went above and beyond to accommodate us. Communication throughout the entire process was excellent, making the day completely stress-free. Highly recommended!"
V291,The Darenth,"I cannot recommend the Darenth more. The staff were absolutely incredible, we could not have wanted for more on our day. We were never without a drink, and nothing was too much of an ask. The staff were so friendly to our guests, and really created a relaxed environment. Leading up to the ceremony they made us feel so relaxed and they were very informative. Jason, Kerry, Sarah, Louise and everyone at the Darenth, thank you so much for making our day so special!"
V291,The Darenth,"We found The Darenth when looking for a venue for our twilight wedding. We wanted our wedding to truly reflect us as a couple and where we could be flexible with how the day would go.

When we went to see The Darenth, not only was the venue stunningly beautiful, inside and out, there was a warmth to the place and the team were so friendly and very helpful. From the moment we contacted the team, Lucy was our main contact and couldn’t help us enough. Despite the number of weddings held here, we felt special throughout as if our special day was the main focus for them all. Lucy was great with all the details, understanding what we wanted and offering help and support without pushing anything.

On the day, Jason was amazing at managing the day - making sure we had time to ourselves but that the day ran exactly as we wanted. He was also very supportive and did a great job putting us at ease when we were nervous leading up to the ceremony. The whole team were thoughtful and looked after us all day, making sure we had food and drink and anything else we needed. All our guests commented on how wonderful the staff were and it allowed us to truly focus on enjoying our day. Leigh and Kerry were also fantastic on the day, couldn’t be more helpful.

We had an amazing day, everything went exactly as we hoped and better. A massive part of that was down to The Darenth and their incredible team - we couldn’t recommend highly enough!"
V291,The Darenth,"From the moment you walk into The Darenth we were made to feel comfortable. We were taken on a tour of the venue and booked there and then In October 2022 for September 2023. The staff were knowledgable and professional which is what made us book this venue.

Communication was always good throughout, we visited several times with different family members and the staff were alway welcoming. As an older couple we wanted that relaxed but professional day and this is what we got.

The venue is amazedly clean and beautiful with views of the golf course. We was lucky even to get married outside and the outside area is amazing but the staff make this place and your day the best it could be.

We dealt with Kerrie and Jason mainly but everyone we had dealings with were great. Jason ran the day and he was brilliant, I love a bit of banter and he was excellent and even made it fun when I was so nervous 😊 there was also a lady that run the evening (sorry I can’t remember her name) she was also really good making sure everything was ok and stayed until the last guest left. One thing they did do was made sure the bride and groom kept topped up with drinks all day and night again a nice touch, I didn’t visit the bar once 😀

The food was amazing and everyone commenting on how good the food was. We had 9 children and they even did a 3 course for them with milk or lemonade for the toast which was a lovely little touch and made the children part of the day.

The only thing I would have liked would be to have a dressing room on site for the wedding day rather than travelling from elsewhere but that’s my personal view.

Thank you to everyone involved in our day ❤️"
V291,The Darenth,"We got married at this beautiful venue 11.08.23 and cannot recommend enough!! Everyone commented saying how perfect the day was, and every detail was covered by the amazing staff!! Nothing is ever too much to ask - we want to do it all over again!! Massive thanks especially to Jason, Kirsty & Kerry!! My go to people on the day and leading up to the wedding! But every member of staff were just amazing and on the ball with everything. Thank you from a very happy couple 🤍"
V291,The Darenth,I couldn’t recommend this venue enough. From the day we walked into the darenth to view this venue we have always felt so welcomed and wanted. They couldn’t do anymore to help us as they went above and beyond. The venue is absolutely stunning from the outside to the inside 💕 myself and my husband would like the thank each and everyone of the staff here at the darenth no words can explain how much you made our dream become a reality 💕 we shall be booking to come back for our yearly anniversary. Highly recommend this venue*5
V291,The Darenth,"My Wife & I would firstly like to thank Jason for his professionalism, humour, and his skill in dealing with things in real time which put both of us at ease as well as all of our guests.

The catering staff on the day were magnificent and very caring towards us all.

Another plus was the generous of food which all guests appreciated, from the Canopes, Wedding Breakfast & Evening Buffet.

The only issue we did have is that it was agreed that we would have Jallof Rice with the Curry Goat & Fried Fish, but ending up having Rice & Peas with the Curry Goat.

The Jallof Rice being an African dish & Curry Goat being Carribean would have been excellent as we had them at our planning meeting 5 weeks before the Wedding.

The big disappointment was the performance of the in house DJ (Chelmer Discos).

The fact that we could not select our own DJ made us nervous about the music, hence we kept confirming whether the DJ had experience of performing for a mainly Afro Caribbean crowd.

We were advised that this was not an issue, and it turns out according to DJ that he lacks expertise with Afro Beats, Soco & Reggae.

We also asked for the love sign to be displayed as a backdrop in the Ballroom before the Wedding Ceremony commenced which was agreed upon by Chelmer Discos, however it arrived after 19.00.

When we tried to ascertain why the love sign was not delivered at the time agreed, and also, why the music was not mixed as appose to just playing tracks that we emailed to him.

In response we received a rude & threatening email from the in house DJ - Jimmy.

We both loved having our Wedding at The Darenth and all our guests have all commented on how brilliant it was & they loved Jason.

Regards. Mr & Mrs Hutton-Young"
V291,The Darenth,"We celebrated our wedding day at the darenth on Thursday 25th may.
I can not fault our experience at all. From start to finish Jason/Kerry & the team made our day perfect."
V291,The Darenth,Just had my wedding at The Darenth and what an amazing experience it was from start to finish. The staff are all fantastic they made me feel very special on my day. They kept us informed throughout the day with everything that was happening and are all so good at their jobs. The food was amazing and got so many compliments from our guests as did the stunning venue. Special shout out to Jason who was our rock during the day.
V291,The Darenth,"Fabulous venue, immaculately decorated. Kerry, Jason and the team were so kind and professional. I have worked at most venues being a wedding florist, but The Darenth was my choice. We had a beautiful day and they treated my guests like family. I will be recommending them to all my brides"
V292,The Spa Hotel,"We are absolutely overjoyed with how our religious wedding ceremony (Nikah) at the Spa Hotel turned out- truly, it felt like a dream come true. From the moment we began planning, the entire experience exceeded our expectations. Despite the tight timeline of just under four months, Emily Phipps, who I believe is any extremely talented Events and Wedding Coordinator worked tirelessly to bring our vision to life. I had so many ideas, most quite unconventional, but Emily welcomed them with open arms and went above and beyond to make it all happen.

Emily brought so much warmth, dedication, and joy to the table, and thanks to her, our religious ceremony was nothing short of magical. It’s rare to find genuine and skilful individuals in the wedding industry who can truly capture the essence of your dreams and make them a reality, but Emily did just that! We could not have asked for a more perfect day and now four months on, we find ourselves reminiscing over how perfect it was.

To Emily, Tina and Mate, we feel that you have become an extension of our own family! You were not only professional but genuinely caring, your hard work and attention to detail ensured that every moment on the day was flawless. We are so grateful for your contribution to making our wedding feel like a scene from a fairy tale. You are all an asset to The Spa Hotel Events Team!!

V292,The Spa Hotel,"When our initial venue unexpectedly closed, we were feeling disheartened; however, we viewed The Spa Hotel and immediately fell in love with its natural beauty, especially its gorgeous Spa Temple. Our coordinator, Emily, was a star and helped us to plan our day to perfection. She was always on hand to answer any queries we had, and she also helped to set up on the day which was very kind of her! We ideally wanted an outdoor ceremony and the weather really came through for us, so we were able to marry surrounded by flowers! The day was an incredible experience from start to finish. David was our wedding coordinator on the day and he went above and beyond to ensure that everything ran smoothly. The team made the process fun and my partner and I were able to enjoy the wedding without any stress or anxiety. Thank you, The Spa Hotel team, for making our day so special."
V292,The Spa Hotel,"We couldn't be happier with our decision to celebrate our marriage at The Spa Hotel.

From beginning to end the service and attention has been incredible. From the moment I arrived to set up our decorations to breakfast in bed and clearing down the room.

We were made to feel special and so were our guests, anything that we needed was delivered.

The suites are beautiful as are the grounds, we felt so lucky to have them as a backdrop to our day.

Our meal was 5*, incredible, we received so many compliments, and food was a big part of the day for us. Delicious!

Thank you, to everyone."
V292,The Spa Hotel,"My husband and I got married and celebrated our wedding reception at the Spa Hotel in December 2023. The day was a dream from start to finish and the team at the Spa did absolutely everything to give us an unforgettable day. Tasha, our wedding coordinated, worked with us from the moment we started planning with the Spa and was available via email and phone regularly to help us work out the details of the day & evening. The setting is beautiful at the Spa, especially at Christmas with all the trees, lights, and decorations. The food was fantastic, everyone commented on how tasty the wedding breakfast & canapes were. The team were so responsive & helpful with the fact that I do not drink, so had all my alternatives to hand all throughout the day. What a perfect place to get married and celebrate our wedding, thank you so much to Tasha and all the team at the Spa Hotel!"
V292,The Spa Hotel,"Beautiful venue, amazing food, the best personable service from the first meeting to the last drink on the day! Thank you so much to Emily and David at the Spa hotel"
V292,The Spa Hotel,"Thank you so much! We had such a great day. For us the best day of our lives so far!

I could not fault the hospitality of you and your staff. If something wasn’t there you guys were straight on it. Nothing was too much to ask. Maty really put our minds at ease. Making sure I didn’t fall down the stairs and having water ready for us when he knew we’d be shaking before starting the ceremony!

It was like a well oiled machine and we didn’t have to lift a finger which took all stress away completely.

A lovely touch was adding the petals in the room and tidying up before we came upstairs. Made us relax so well.

Everyone was so helpful. I’d also like to mention how helpful one of your staff was. I’m not sure of his name, he had red hair. He could see I was panicking in the morning and reassured me by telling me everything was being set up for the ceremony. He was very accommodating and I’m sure he’ll go far in your industry!

Also thank you to Emily. Everything went so well and that’s all down to her coordination. Every staff member knew what needed to be done.

Again thank you so so much!! I’m sure we’ll be back again and of course we will be recommending you guys to everyone we know!!"
V292,The Spa Hotel,"We cannot thank the spa hotel enough, they were so incredible and the whole process made us at ease throughout. Our guests were so impressed at the quality of service, food and drink. We even had guests with sensitive allergies at our day and they had no issues. Everything went perfectly thanks to all the staff.
I couldn’t recommend them more to anyone. So thank you the spa hotel for making our dream wedding."
V292,The Spa Hotel,"We are so happy that we chose to have our wedding day at the Spa Hotel! Right from the beginning, you were so fantastic - fielding questions, keeping us on schedule with jobs and always being a very lovely friendly face to speak to whenever we needed. We so, so appreciate you.

The wedding venue was so beautiful - the photographs have come out so well! The backdrop is absolutely stunning. I’ve just forwarded you our wedding video tease and I’ll send some photos separately. Please feel free to use on any social media.

Your team on the day were great too, so lovely and kind to us."
V292,The Spa Hotel,We got married earlier this summer at The Spa Hotel and it was fabulous. Everybody there is so professional and are experts at what they do. Everybody was so accommodating and helped make our day so incredibly special. The organisation from everybody was amazing (in particular Natasha) and we had the best day. The day went without a hitch and was everything we dreamed of and more. Our guests had a great time and the food was incredible. I can't recommend The Spa Hotel as a wedding venue more!
V292,The Spa Hotel,"After months of planning, discussions and decisions we were finally married at The Spa Hotel, Royal Tunbridge Wells on Saturday.

Thank you to Tasha, David, Jake and the whole team for helping us on the way and delivering a perfect day (despite the weather) with superb and attentive service as well as everything we requested meeting and exceeding our expectations."
V293,Winters Barns,"This was the first venue we visited in person and knew from the moment we walked in the door, walked through the grounds and spoke with the team (Sophie) - this is where we want to get married.

The pre planning process, the correspondence, the queries, the multiple visits - nothing was too much trouble and everything was addressed promptly and in a detailed manner (if it was easier to explain something over the phone rather than email, thats exactly what they would do).

The venue was perfect for guests to explore and roam (& children) but can be contained in a safe surrounding.

On the day, I think it was summed up perfectly by our videographer ""the team are fantastic here, and if anything does go wrong on the day you wont even notice - they are so professional"". We can contest to this - it was perfect!

Thank you Sophie and the Team
x"
V293,Winters Barns,"This venue gives 10/10 for everything. We had looked at four venues before this one. As soon as we walked in we knew it was exactly what we wanted for our winter wedding and the need for onsite accommodation. The service was second to none, we didn’t have to lift a finger on the day and didn’t need to check anything or worry about anything. The caterers were five star, the service was exceptional, all of our guests remarked on the extremely professional service and amazing food. I would give it all 10 out of 10. The band, The Redfords were also superb, in the evening. Sally looked after everything superbly. If you want a magical stress free day that runs like clockwork - book it!"
V293,Winters Barns,"Winters Barns was the perfect setting for our wedding.
We had the most amazing day and could not recommend it highly enough.
Lizzie was absolutely amazing and made the whole process so easy for us.
Everyone was there to help but they were not intrusive at all.
All our guests were blown away by the service and the food - everyone has made great memories.
We have some amazing photos from the grounds and it was so easy having everything all in one place - from getting ready to staying overnight.
Even the set up and taking down was done for us so we didn't have to think about anything - we could just enjoy it all.
I could not have wished for a better venue and they exceeded our expectations by far!"
V293,Winters Barns,"For a venue as busy as Winters Barns, they truly made us feel like the only people getting married, remembering the small details and providing invaluable advice throughout planning and coordination. Getting excited with us during the planning, liaising with our vendors and giving us helpful prompts as we got closer to the day. We never once struggled to get in contact with the venue or get a clear answer on our questions… and there was a few!
On our final meeting where we ran through all the little details, we were met with suggestions and solid guidance which left us feeling confident our dream day was going to come to life as we imagined.
Sally is a SUPERSTAR and our day was run to perfection thanks to her. She pays attention to detail and run us on time to the minute, but she also had lots of fun with it. Popping in to check on us all getting ready always with a big smile and some sound advice and a little time check! Sally put us both as ease as we knew if there was an issue she would resolve it.
Our day at the venue was perfect, from getting ready and building up to the ceremony, it was faultless. The call button in the getting ready spaces is brilliant, this saved the men who were all struggling with their pocket squares and needed super Sally to come and save them!
The accommodation was beautiful and the perfect way to extend the celebrations a bit longer with a recovery breakfast with our families the next morning.
We honestly had the perfect day, as did our guests and have received endless compliments on the venue; the service and everything in between. If we were to relive the day we would not change a single thing.
Thank you so much to the winters barns team and Sally, we couldn’t have done it without you!"
V293,Winters Barns,"Right from the first appointment we knew the venue was gorgeous and it was the one for us! Since booking the staff were always so helpful over emails for any queries whilst I was planning! On the big day we had Lizzie look after us, she is truly the best at what she does!!
I was so set on having an outdoor ceremony but due to weather it had to be inside, however I wasn’t disappointed! It was beautiful inside especially with the fresh new hops (September wedding). Everything went smoothly and we couldn’t have had a better day. We used all the accommodation on site too which was great, clean and comfortable!"
V293,Winters Barns,"Winters Barns is an incredible venue. It has a beautiful rustic charm, from the exposed beams in the bar, wedding breakfast and dance floor areas, to the dried hops hanging from the ceiling. The courtyard is stunning and was well used by our guests well into the evening. The pond with the bridge makes for beautiful pictures and was a huge selling point for us.
The staff were truly amazing. I cannot fault them. They’re incredibly warm and friendly and really do make you feel special. They never once gave the impression they do this every day, rather that yours is the most important day in the world!
We absolutely loved our day - it was truly unforgettable, largely thanks to the brilliant team at Winters Barns."
V293,Winters Barns,"A truly stunning venue! We cannot thank Winters Barns enough for making our day so incredibly special. The staff are so friendly, welcoming and professional, nothing is too much to ask of them and they ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible. We were able to fully enjoy our day knowing everything was being dealt with behind the scenes.
The venue and its grounds are beautiful, the perfect setting for some stunning wedding pictures! The facilities at this venue are amazing from the garden, the barn itself, the salon and pump room to get ready in the morning of the wedding. The accommodation is beautiful and so incredibly clean!
If you’re looking for a barn wedding, I cannot recommend Winters Barns enough! You will not be disappointed! Thank you once again!"
V293,Winters Barns,"We would to thank Sally and her team at Winters Barns for making our special day come to life. This venue is absolutely beautiful allowing for some stunning photos. All our guests commented on its cutsie barn vibes and well maintained grounds.
The food was exactly what we wanted with our 3 course meal and evening food, all delivered with amazing service.
We couldn’t praise or recommend this venue enough!
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
V293,Winters Barns,"Our wedding at Winters Barns was a dream come true. From the moment we arrived, we were captivated by the enchanting atmosphere and timeless charm. The stunning surroundings and well-maintained grounds created the perfect backdrop for our special day.

The staff at Winters Barns went above and beyond to ensure every detail was perfect. Their professionalism and warm hospitality made us feel truly special. From the seamless coordination to the meticulous attention to detail, the entire day ran smoothly, allowing us to relax and fully enjoy each moment.

The ceremony area, with its rustic elegance and intimate setting, created an unforgettable experience. The reception space was equally impressive, with charming decor and a spacious layout that comfortably accommodated our guests. The lighting and ambiance added a touch of romance, making the evening even more magical.

We can’t rate Winters Barns highly enough. It exceeded our expectations in every way, providing us with cherished memories that will last a lifetime. If you’re looking for a wedding venue that combines beauty, elegance, and exceptional service, Winters Barns is the perfect choice."

V294,Cooling Castle Barn,"Cooling Castle Barn really was our perfect wedding venue. We fell in love instantly and it was the only venue we looked at for our wedding and booked immediately before we even left! The price of the venue and what is included is incredible, it was worth every single penny and we’d highly recommend. Every single staff member we came into contact with couldn’t have helped enough! Out toastmaster (Steve) was absolutely amazing and co-ordinator on the day (Chelsea) was so so helpful with everything that we needed and made sure that everything was sorted and we didn’t have to think of a thing on the day! The getting ready rooms were perfect and the food was absolutely incredible!! We had so many comments about the food and the venue in general from our guests, everyone absolutely loved it!! Thank you so much, we had the most amazing wedding at the most perfect venue x"
V294,Cooling Castle Barn,"From start to finish, the staff were so friendly and professional! Everything was broken down and made so simple, the app was incredible to help keep track of planning. On the day Becky was honestly everything we could have asked for, she kept us updated on everything that was happening whilst we were getting ready and made everything run so smoothly. Would recommend this venue to anyone, we had so many compliments on our choice and had everything we needed under one roof! Topped off by returning to our room with champagne, cake and chocolates. We cannot say thank you enough!! Mr and Mrs Jeeves x"

V295,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We got married on 17 May 2024 and planned a weekend of celebrations with our family and friends, including a 'We tied the knot' cocktail party in the Brasserie on the 18 May 2024. The hotel has a number of quirky and interesting spaces perfect for adding a different feel to parts of your celebration as well as different photo opportunities. It has a trendy and luxurious feel with lots of unique and modern touches. OWP is also a stones throw away from the historic Pantiles which whilst not only beautiful also had a selection of bars, restaurants and boutique shops to entertain our guests during down time. Many of our guests commented it was like being in Europe and again the surrounding areas are perfect for photos.

Not only is the venue beautiful, but the staff and service are absolutely incredible and I do not say this lightly, the service was second to none and everyone was welcoming and friendly creating a true home away from home experience. Karen our Wedding Co-ordinator was amazing and flexible to our different needs. One of the things that attracted us to OWP was our wedding was treated as an individual celebration something we had not found at other venues which had a fairly set itinerary. The food was amazing with a large choice of options, we opted for a deluxe choice menu and it did not disappoint. It was also great value for money which enabled us to carry out our celebrations over a long weekend whilst also focusing on our entertainment and creating the atmosphere we wanted.

If you want a venue that is modern, trendy, flexible and different from the traditional country house wedding then I highly recommend. We have a weekend of memories at One Warwick Park with our nearest and dearest that we will treasure forever and can't wait to return for our anniversary's.

Thank you to the whole One Warwick Park team! Sarah & Sam"
V295,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We had the pleasure of having our wedding at the Warwick Park Hotel, it was an amazing experience for us as a couple and all our guests. Karen our Event coordinator was great with us, she was very receptive to our ideas and did all she can to make it possible even though our wedding was on short notice.

For the actual day, the whole team was excellent, nothing was too much for them.

They went above and beyond for all our guest, one thing that stood out for me was on the day of the wedding the Club room which was the standard complimentary room for the wedding night was used by my wife to get ready in the morning, to avoid us getting back to the same room and enhance our experience on our big day we were upgraded to the Deluxe Room with other complementaries which just made our day perfect. All our bags were moved for us we didn't even need to touch anything which was a really nice touch for us.

Can't say a thank you big enough to Karen and her excellent team, we were chose Warwick on recommendation and we can boldly say we were not disappointed.

And will definitely recommend Warwick Park Hotel to anyone looking for a top of the range service and venue.

Thank you."
V295,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We had an amazing wedding! The venue allowed us to be flexible with our requirements. We had so many lovely comments about the venue, hotel and food. Service and staff were amazing.
The day went to plan and was perfect in every way.
Our wedding meal was lovely. The function room looked beautiful.
Our room, junior suite was spacious and really enjoyed the 3 nights we was there.
Thank you to Karen and all the staff for making our day so special!!"
V295,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We had a lovely day at One Warwick Park for our wedding. Karen was very helpful and stayed the entire wedding day. Finn and Alice are 2 amazing members of staff.
The food was lovely and everything was organised well. Thank you OWP."
V295,One Warwick Park Hotel,"One Warwick Park is utterly amazing for a wedding venue!

I cant thank Karen and every staff member at OWP for making our wedding day perfect.

Karen and I connected via emails and calls in the months leading up to the wedding, the communication was perfect. Everything I ever asked for or things we talked about nothing was never a problem, Karen and the OWP team were brilliant to work with.

The venue is so gorgeous, Modern and Elegant. The Room is bright and large with a gorgeous fire place and open brick wall with wooden beams.
The hotel rooms are so sophisticated and modern. We stayed in ‘The House’ and for Bridal party prep this was the perfect location!!! It was dreamy!!! Spacious, comfy beds, gorgeous kitchen and bathrooms. It was so special to stay with bridesmaids & Family members the night before, but each of us having our own bedroom in a house environment, the House is just amazing!

The food was fabulous!
The chef created some gorgeous dishes for 80 guests, many with dietary requirements, this was no trouble at all and each guests feedback about their meal was that it was all delicious! Thank you chef!!
Our evening buffet – the compliments we received were great here too!. Especially the chicken goujons!
The wedding tasting afternoon OWP hosted to sample wedding day food was amazing. We tried all the wines and dishes, it was so lovely to enjoy this day as a pre wedding day date day. Thank you so much!

I popped into the venue multiple times before the wedding day to visualize and ask various questions that I ever had. Any team member I ever met was so friendly, helpful and kind. Nothing was ever a problem for anyone.

Days before our wedding I sent Karen a photo of some cocktails I liked, Karen worked with the food and beverage manager to bring my idea into reality. I was so happy – thank you so much!

On the day of the wedding Karen you popped in and out, and were there to support me from 7am - I loved it so much the way you kept connected with us, thank you!
My emotions were high throughout the day and this didn’t phase you at all, your support was truly appreciated!

We could not be any more happier with the way our wedding day went. We had such amazing feedback from our guests on how gorgeous the venue and the hotel are. And How good the food was!

Thank you so much for everything Karen. You are great at what you do!!
Enjoy every moment of your own wedding very soon! We are sending you all our love!

Please pass our huge thanks to everyone who worked and helped us during our wedding.
It is so very much appreciated. xxxx"
V295,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We will never be able to thank Karen and the whole One Warwick Park team enough. We would highly recommend this beautiful venue to anyone planning their wedding and are truly grateful for the effort that went into ensuring our day was exactly what we wanted. The food was amazing and we had lots of compliments from the guests on how friendly and polite the bar staff were.
Thank you for helping to make us the happiest we’ve ever felt. We can’t wait to come back and stay for our first wedding anniversary."
V295,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We always knew we wanted a boutique venue to suit our modest budget and the moment we saw OWP we fell in love with its chic and simple interior, perfect for putting our own spin on our special day. Karen and the OWP team were fantastic throughout the wedding planning process. No request was too big/ difficult for Karen and she was so attentive to our wants and needs. We had the most magical Christmas wedding and cannot be happier with how it all turned out! Thank you Karen and team for making our special day perfect!"
V295,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We loved this wedding venue the first time we saw it. We wanted a Christmas wedding and the room with the beams, lights and Christmas tree looked amazing. Planning of the wedding was helped by Karen who gave fantastic recommendations. Nothing was too much trouble. We had the most amazing day. Big thank you."
V295,One Warwick Park Hotel,"Cannot thank Karen and the OWP staff enough for our magical day. From the moment we saw the venue we fell in love and everything was so simple and we wanted for nothing.

The venue has a modern class in an area of Old style beauty. The venue can comfortably hold either a large number or a smaller more intimate celebration and will still look magical."
V295,One Warwick Park Hotel,"Where do I even start….

When we first visited the hotel I knew it would make the perfect venue for our wedding. The function room was perfect, modern, perfect size, the bar was amazing. It just ticked all the boxes.

Karen was absolutely amazing, she was there every step of the way answering all my question and giving advice. She helped us organised our day and help us make an idea on paper turn into the most amazing day.

Before the wedding day we got to attend a wedding menu tasting session was great, every dish we tried was lovely and so happy with our choices everyone at the wedding said how amazing the food was.

On the day the help from all the staff was amazing from welcoming our guests and helping all our suppliers, made me feel so calm as the bride as I knew I didn’t have to worry about anything. From start to finish the wedding was perfect and it wouldn’t have happened without the help of Karen and everyone at the hotel - they turned around the rooms so quickly and the service from the bar staff was perfect.

I couldn’t recommend this venue enough they have everything you need and more for the perfect wedding."
V296,Chapel House Estate,"Chapel House Estate and the team were absolutely amazing! We knew from the first time we saw the venue that it was the one - every single location is beautiful and provides stunning photo opportunities. Every person that we spoke to was so helpful, especially Georgia who was our fabulous on-the-day co-ordinator! We did have a few issues with music during dinner but these were promptly rectified by the staff (with the help of the Head Chef's phone!). The food was absolutely fabulous and I think everyone who came to our wedding was absolutely blown away from start to finish. Thank you so much for making our day everything we dreamed it would be!"
V296,Chapel House Estate,"The most amazing, stunningly beautiful wedding venue, catered for our micro wedding with as much care an attention as a big wedding, Jade our wedding co-ordinator was amazing! The food in the no 9 restaurant was as out of this world! Highly recommend!"
V296,Chapel House Estate,"We cannot recommend Chapel House Estate enough. From the very beginning the team here were so helpful and accommodating.

We’ve been to weddings before that have felt a little disorganised and of course, things can happen out of anyone’s control, however, as soon as booked our wedding here we felt like we were in safe hands. Throughout the entire process, we felt so at ease, and that’s thanks for the team. Georgia and the team worked so hard for us and it really showed. The day ran so smoothly.

The grounds in the venue are truly stunning too and offered the perfect backdrop for our special day. We decided to get married in August as we really loved the orchard and gardens, and to top it off we spent the rest of the day in the beautiful courtyard. We have to mention the food too. We opted for the BBQ option and wow. It was so delicious and all our guests really loved it.

In summary, you won’t regret getting married here. The venue is stunning, the team are fantastic and the food is to die for. Thank you so much Chapel House Estate."
V296,Chapel House Estate,"We had our wedding here in the court yard this last Sunday and all I can say is wow - they exceeded our expectations and more .

Every detail was perfect.
The venue is truly breathtaking and all our guests were blown away by how magical it looked.
The food was exquisite which all our guests have continued to talk about.

V296,Chapel House Estate,"We got married at Chapel House Estate in August 2023.

From being shown around the venue by the owner a year earlier, we knew it would be perfect, and indeed, it was!

The grounds are beautifully maintained.

The Chapel House has been finished to an exquisite standard, and the other accommodation on site is great and was loved by our guests.

The whole site was impeccably maintained and as clean as a whistle.

There is ample parking.

The Team went out of their way to accommodate us, with a bespoke menu and served individual alternatives for those with non standard dietary requirements (vegan, veggie and various intolerances!).

The food was of an exceptional standard for over 100 guests and the service was both charming and faultless. It was apparent to us both that the entire team were committed to making our wedding day a resounding success!

In short we were completely blown away by the venue when we first saw it and it overdelivered! What a superb venue!

Special shouts out to Jade, Georgia and the chefs! You are now part of our story!

Would we recommend it?

YES, WE WOULD!"
V296,Chapel House Estate,"If you're dreaming of a wedding that transports you to a faraway destination without leaving the shores of Kent, look no further than Chapel House Estate. This hidden gem is a testament to luxury, elegance, and the promise of an unforgettable wedding experience.

From the moment I stepped onto the grounds, I was whisked away to a Mediterranean haven. The outdoor waiting reception area exuded charm and sophistication, adorned with lush greenery, fragrant blooms, and tasteful decor. The soft rustling of leaves and the gentle breeze lent an air of serenity, setting the perfect tone for the day.

The outdoor wedding setup was nothing short of magical. With sweeping views that seemed to stretch endlessly, it felt as if I was watching the exchanging vows in a private paradise. The attention to detail in the decorations was impeccable, and the natural beauty of the surroundings only enhanced the atmosphere of romance and celebration.

The resort's reception area was a true showstopper. Elegant and opulent, it provided a stunning backdrop for speeches and the main course. The seamless blend of indoor and outdoor spaces allowed us to enjoy the best of both worlds. The expansive glass windows offered uninterrupted views of the picturesque surroundings, while the tasteful interior design added an element of grandeur to the celebration.

The culinary experience was nothing short of extraordinary. The menu showcased a fusion of flavours that left myself raving for more. From delectable appetisers to the exquisite main courses, every dish was a work of art washed down with the very best drop of Rosé. The culinary team's attention to detail and dedication to creating a memorable dining experience was evident in every bite.

The staff at Chapel House Estate were outstanding with a special shout out to Katie for really going above and beyond. Their professionalism, warmth, and attentiveness ensured that every aspect of our special day ran seamlessly. They anticipated my needs before I even realised them, and their genuine smiles and willingness to go above and beyond left a lasting impression on myself and it seemed all guests. A huge kudos to Darren & the force on such an incredible team dynamic.

In conclusion, Chapel House Estate is a true gem in Kent, offering a wedding experience that rivals the most exotic destinations abroad. The combination of breathtaking outdoor spaces, luxurious indoor settings, world-class cuisine, and exceptional service creates a truly unforgettable celebration. If you're seeking a wedding venue that transcends the ordinary, Chapel House Estate is the perfect choice. My heart is filled with gratitude for the memories that were created in this enchanting oasis."
V296,Chapel House Estate,"This venue is first class. All our guests said it was one of the best wedding venues that they have been to. Our day surpassed all of our expectations. The staff made sure the day was seamless. Food was great, service was amazing and the venue is stunning. Would highly recommend to anyone in a heartbeat. Special thank you to Jade and Georgia for ensuring the day was so special. X"
V296,Chapel House Estate,"A few weeks ago my partner and I had the complete pleasure of attending our dear friends’ wedding at Chapel House Estate.
Of course it was lovely to attend and be part of their day. We had heard good things about the venue, but we were taken back with its fabulousness.
Close by to our home in Broadstairs, we felt we had arrived at a far away country estate far further away than we have travelled.
This set the perfect stage for the quintessential and stylish day of celebrations, which continued with partying and fun into the late evening.
The day was faultless.

Having worked in the wedding and events sector both in the UK and the Middle East, I have been lucky to have experienced many events, both as guest and a professional.
The wedding at CHE was up there with the best, from the F&B to the furnishings and staff.
In fact so good it even made me consider getting married again!"
V297,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"The team at Port Lympne were absolutely phenomenal. Months of planning and working with us to ensure our big day would go off without any issues, and it led to a really stress-free day for the both of us, allowing us to fully enjoy our wedding day.

There are far too many things to mention, it’s simply impossible to fully cover the scope of everything they have done for us as part of our wedding.

Guests were raving about pretty much every aspect of the day, and many said it was the best wedding they’d ever been to and probably will ever go to. Quite a few of the vendors made a point of communicating a similar sentiment to us as well!

Comminication is unparalleled, they will do everything they possible can to accommodate any request you may have, and worked tirelessly to provide us with an amazing experience.

We really did get to have a dream wedding, far beyond anything we could have ever imagined.

An immense thank you to everyone, the staff on-site, logistics team, event coordinators, etc… everyone came together to put us first and make the day the most amazing day of our lives."
V297,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Port Lympne is an incredible venue, such a unique and special location for your special day. We had spent our first weekend away as a couple there so it was great to go back 6 years later to get married.
All of our guests loved the venue and the day, and they still talk about the safari and how incredible it was.
Sadly for us, we were let down by the operations team on the day which caused unnecessary stress. The event team were great in the build up, with a few minor issues due to limited flexibility on their end. We also had about 3 different main points of contact due to staff turnover and therefore the package we agreed to and had changed and led to tense discussions. The issues for us arose on the day where the event team handed over the wedding to the operations team who we hadn't met and it seemed to be the first time they had heard of our wedding. Despite handing them a detailed folder explaining how the tables should be laid out, seating plans and all the other essentials, they made numerous mistakes resulting in the wedding party having to fix many of these just before the bride arrived! A few of our suppliers commented how it felt like the venue mustn't have had many weddings due to some of the issues on the day.

However, despite all of these challenges, everything else was magical. The venue spaces are incredible and the food was exceptional. The safari was a real highlight for us and all the guests."
V297,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"We couldn’t have chosen a more magical venue for our wedding than Port Lympne. The setting was absolutely breathtaking—our guests were in awe of the views and the atmosphere - and that was before the wedding started!

The team at Port Lympne went above and beyond to make sure every detail was perfect, allowing us to enjoy every moment without a worry. The pergola and the orangery looked phenomenal in sun!

provided such a charming space for our reception. The food was exceptional, tailored to our tastes, and so many of our guests commented on how delicious it was.

One of the highlights was incorporating the wildlife reserve into our day. After the meal all of our guests got on trucks for a guided safari, which they absolutely loved—it added such a unique and memorable touch to the whole experience.

We couldn’t recommend Port Lympne enough. It was truly the perfect venue, and we’ll cherish the memories of our special day forever."
V297,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Port Lympne is an absolutely stunning venue, from the moment you arrive, you can feel how special and beautiful it is. The pergola has been designed so beautifully, with faux flowers intertwined all around it. It doesn't need any further decorating, it is stunning. What is great about this too is that the staff can put up Perspex glass over the windows if the weather isn't ideal, or can leave the windows open for a nice breeze if the day is good. The orangery is breath taking. As a bride, the worry about making either of these areas look pretty was a job already completed. Easily, the best and most beautiful venue.

The Wedding Team are incredible from start to finish. Nothing is too much trouble, they respond quickly to emails. I felt so cared for throughout the entire process, both myself and my husband were impressed by them. It is more expensive than other venues, but they are worth it. I'd hire them again in a heartbeat. We changed things close to the wedding day, the team easily accommodated, we asked for a different area for the reception drinks (we had to pay for this), but again, the team said yes and adjusted the scheduling in a thoughtful manner so we had more time by the southern terrace.

Food is amazing. We had lots of compliments about this. They catered for a number of vegetarian and vegan guests with ease. The evening buffet was so good. Plenty of good high quality food. I really was impressed.

We had the safari between the meal and evening reception - it was the best. Guests loved it, we loved it.

Honestly the best venue and staff. I want to attend a PL wedding as a guest now!!"
V297,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Looking for a spectacular, unique venue with exceptional customer service? Look no further than Port Lympne! It's hard to find a better wedding venue. From the staff to the views, the facilities to the accommodation, and the food to the animals, everything is outstanding. Every member of staff goes above and beyond to make everyone feel welcome and to provide unforgettable experiences. Words like ""unbelievable,"" ""breathtaking,"" and ""stunning"" were frequently used by our guests, many of whom claimed it was the best wedding they had ever attended.

Special shout-outs go to…

Ceyda: Thank you for being our incredible wedding coordinator. Your responsiveness to countless emails and your dedication to making our big day exactly what we dreamed of were remarkable. Thank you for altering our function sheet so many times without question and for holding my drinks and fluffing my dress when needed!

Charlotte: Your calming presence and willingness to accommodate every request were invaluable. Thank you for keeping me calm in the morning and for your excellent communication throughout the day, ensuring everything ran seamlessly.

Our glorious toastmasters, Jonathan and Nikki: WOW, what a duo! Thank you for ensuring our day ran smoothly and for guiding our guests flawlessly. We (and our guests) loved both of your outfits, especially the park ranger uniforms.

Harry: Thank you for rescuing me and my bridesmaids when we locked ourselves out of Rhino Lodge.

Wedding breakfast serving staff: Your prompt, well-coordinated, and faultless delivery of our food was exceptional.

The chefs: Thank you for producing a mouthwatering three-course meal that was beautifully presented. Our guests couldn't believe the high standard of food and that all main courses were served hot. Thank you also for accommodating special requests and dietary requirements.

Evening bar staff: Your constant smiles and enthusiasm, especially joining in with the Macarena, added so much fun to our celebration.

Hotel staff: Thank you for assisting our overnight guests with check-in and ensuring their bags were taken to their rooms, allowing them to celebrate without interruption.

Our wedding at Port Lympne was a dream come true, thanks to the incredible team and the breathtaking venue. We highly recommend it to anyone looking for a truly magical wedding experience."
V297,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Venue
We opted for Port Lympne to start with as we were swept away with the beauty of the venue. It’s truly the most beautiful place we visited. The mansion house is a lovely reception area, the pergola and orangery are private so just your guests get to enjoy this section. The pergola is light and beautiful, and perfect backdrop for a ceremony. It’s really easy to dress up with flowers, as it’s already so beautiful it doesn’t take much.
The orangery is amazing, high ceilings, beautiful greenery & rose bushes surround the area. There’s lovely lawns which you have the option to play garden games on & have photos.
The Moroccan courtyard is perfect for photos, and again doesn’t need any extra dressing or decoration to make it look beautiful - it’s simply stunning everywhere!

The Wedding Team
First the venue sweeps you the way, then the staff do! They are extremely helpful, lovely and attentive. I emailed them a couple of times a week leading up to the big day and they replied within a few hours every time.
On the big day they weren’t overbearing, no request was too much & they were there whenever we needed them.
They do multiple walk throughs with you & introduce you to everyone who is working on your wedding so you know who to ask if there’s any additional requests.

Food & Drink
On the lead up, you get to try the wedding food. They also offer a choice of two for starters mains and desserts (in contrast to other venues we viewed which only allowed for one choice).
The food was incredible, rich and yummy (not dry at all which you sometimes find with wedding food).
The queue for the bar was quick all night (and we had over 100 guests who are all big drinkers). There was no draught beer which we were worried about, but it was fine on the day as this meant everyone was served quickly.
The wine they pair the food with was gorgeous - and again you get to try all this before the big day.
They were accommodating to vegetarians and multiple allergies. This was all planned before hand & we had no issues with this on our day.

Safari
We opted for safari and it was a really magical and memorable touch. All our guests loved it!
You also get to use the buggies the day after the wedding (up to 10am) which is a lovely way to recover from the wedding and a fun way to start your first day of marriage bliss!

There’s nothing more we could have asked for! Perfect for 100-150 guests."
V297,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Port Lympne was an outstanding venue the whole team amazing from the events team to the ground staff always welcoming and helpful up to the day and then the wedding itself.
Safari it’s a great added extra guests totally loved. The mansion house was a perfect venue that sold it for us on our first visit. Outstanding accommodation across the site and food across the day was perfect.
Thank you port lympne team."
V297,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Our October wedding at Port Lympne was stunning - we had our ceremony in the Pergola followed by a reception in The Orangery, and the day ran smoothly. The staff are friendly and accommodating, the venue itself is beautiful with very little additional decorations needed, the safari was a huge talking point and we've been told repeatedly that the food was the best anyone had at a wedding all year. We'd definitely recommend booking your wedding here, you won't regret it."
V297,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Port Lympne as it's no normal wedding venue, it's the Disneyland of Kent wedding venues. We would also like to say a big thank you to Stephanie who worked so hard to make sure the day was perfect. She made our dream weddings come true with Georgina, and Olivia, who handled every aspect of the day so well. All our guests were blown away and had the time of their lives. They keep telling us how perfect the venue was. It really does have it all: 5 star food, the most stunning spaces, water features, coastal views, and breathtaking grounds with animals from across the world (which all our guests got to see as part of our day). If you are looking for a venue that ticks all the boxes Port Lympne and the team can and will make this happen.The team managed everything so professionally, and they made our dream come true! Thank you from the bottom of our hearts."
V297,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"We were married at Port Lympne on the August bank holiday 2023 and would thoroughly recommend the venue.

The Port Lympne team were incredibly helpful and responsive throughout. No question or detail was too much for Stephanie and Annie, who provided an excellent standard of service; they were straightforward to deal with and any concerns or queries were dealt with swiftly.
The wedding day itself ran smoothly and was truly memorable for both us and our guests. The combination of the pergola and the orangery provide for a stunning venue. There are also so many locations for beautiful photos!

A key reason we chose Port Lympne was the high-quality food we had experienced on previous visits to the garden room. For our wedding breakfast, we selected the sea bass with brown crab gnocchi, which was delicious and enjoyed by all guests. There is also an option to select a second/alternative main for those who preferred a non-fish dish.

In the evening we surprised our guests with the safari; it is a must-do and made the day truly memorable and unique.

We also had over 50 guests staying at the venue overnight and Stephanie and Annie efficiently co-ordinated the transport and accommodation elements.

Overall, we had a fantastic day and would highly recommend Port Lympne to couples seeking a unique and special wedding day."
V298,Salomons Estate,"I am so happy my (now) husband and I decided to have our wedding here! Everything about our big day was nothing short of perfect. From the moment we looked at this venue, I know it was everything we wanted.

Our day of coordinator, Leah, was absolutely lovely. Not only is she attentive, but she is kind, thoughtful, and incredibly detail-oriented, making every part of the process seamless and stress-free. I can’t be more grateful to have had her by my side.

The venue decorated for the holidays just days before our wedding, providing us with beautiful added decor and magic! My friends and family love the many rooms and areas to explore, including the museum, gardens, bar, terrace, etc.

We opted for afternoon tea for our wedding breakfast and pizza for late night bites and our guests absolutely loved it! They offered options for our friends with gf, veggie, etc dietary requirements, and people raved about their meals! They have options for everyone.

Between the beautiful venue, genuinely lovely staff, and delicious food and drink, I cannot be more grateful to Leah and everyone at Salomons. I got to live out my fairytale dream wedding here, and I am so excited for every couple who chooses to do the same. You will have the best day of your lives."
V298,Salomons Estate,"The venue is absolutely stunning which our guests also commented on, from the impressive driveway entrance to the beautiful decor inside. We had our ceremony in the Gold Room which had so much detail we did not need to decorate too much further. We then moved through to the Drawing Room for our Wedding Breakfast and Evening Reception. This was the perfect size for our wedding and we were able to decorate the whole area (including the bar and lounge area) creating an inviting atmosphere. The staff are absolutely amazing, from the initial enquiry to the planning to the actual day. The Events team were always on hand to answer any questions or emails and the bar staff on the day were so polite and professional. Even after the wedding, the following day, the staff were still happy and helpful. The food is amazing and so tasty, it was served quickly and hot , allergies were very easily accommodated and the prosecco was lovely. There was nothing that was too much trouble and our Wedding Planner Leah could not do enough to make sure everything went well."
V298,Salomons Estate,"Salomons will now hold a special place in our heart forever. Thankyou so much for everything. Erin our coordinator was incredible and I’m so pleased with her ethics, friendliness and experience. Thankyou!"
V298,Salomons Estate,"We had a summer wedding at Salomons and were lucky enough to have an outdoor ceremony and cocktail hour. It was the perfect place to host our guests (we had 140 guests) and there was a lot of space for everyone to explore, sit and walk around.
We had many compliments about the quality of the food. Our suppliers even said it was the best meal they'd had while working! We did the Sharing Roast and having the guests in chef's hat to carve the roast was a very popular part of our day.
I can't compliment the events team at Salomon's enough. In the last month before the wedding, they were so responsive and went above and beyond. We had a few changes in staff on their side and changed our main coordinator but it had 0 impact to the quality of our day.
On the day, our coordinator Willow was exceptional - keeping the show running and making sure that everyone was well looked after.
We were beyond happy with our wedding and Salomon's will always hold a special place in our heart!"
V298,Salomons Estate,"What can I say, this is a beautiful venue for start. We had Willow as our coordinator and she was beyond perfect! She made sure everything was on point and was excellent with communication! The staff on the day were so helpful and friendly, everyone was raving about them. It was just amazing! I wish we could do it again! Our wedding was three weeks ago, so we are still on cloud 9. The venue catered for all our guests dietaries & were amazing with accommodation!"
V298,Salomons Estate,"Salomons Estate was more than I could have asked for. Erin, our coordinator, was so on top of things throughout the day and so helpful. We had to plan this whole thing from abroad and it was quite stressful but Erin was so calm throughout the process and there were no issues whatsoever. The venue was absolutely beautiful and such a great space for hold events - highly highly recommend! Also, the food was excellent!"
V298,Salomons Estate,"I cannot recommend getting married at Salomons Estate enough.

The whole team are amazing to work with and when first visiting I felt so relaxed and at ease in their company - a lot of other venues felt very pushy in comparison looking back.

We absolutely loved that they had so many options in regards to food and drinks packages. We went for their bbq option which was perfect as we didn’t want a 3 course sit down, we wanted something a bit more relaxed. The food was delicious and everyone said they felt really full compared to some other weddings they’d been to!

The grounds themselves are stunning. We were so fortunate that we got married on the terrace, but the back up room inside was also beautiful if the weather hadn’t been on our side! We had our reception in the science theatre that is such a unique room and so beautiful.

Our wedding parties stayed the night before in the gatehouse and the bridal cottage, most of our wedding party also stayed the evening of the wedding in the hotel accommodation. This really extended our wedding celebration and I’m so grateful we could all stay on site in lovely accommodation.

I could go on and on for hours, but to summarise; the venue is not only stunning but is matched in amazing service."
V298,Salomons Estate,"Salomons was a beautiful location for a wedding! We had a winter wedding and chose it because we liked the indoor setup for our wedding for approximately 100 people, and also wanted on site accommodation. However, the grounds are beautiful and we got lucky with the weather and have had many pretty shots taken outside.

The events team helped us pull together our wedding plan and ensured matters ran smoothly on the day. We had a great time with the tasting in the lead up to our wedding. We also used a number of the recommended suppliers from Salomons and together they put together a truly amazing wedding. Erin helped coordinate our day and also chaueffered us around for our photos as the grounds were a bit wet!

The catering team did a top job on the day. Our guests were raving about how good the food was, and how generous the portions were too! Salomons offered a good selection of wines and their F&B team were flexible to try to source drinks that weren't readily available on the menu. If needed, we were able to supply our own bottles and pay corkage.

My father has some health issues, and the team did everything they could to make his experience on the day as comfortable as possible. I'm really grateful to Salomons for this.

In summary, I'd highly recommend Salomons Estate as a venue for anyone considering a wedding venue in Kent."
V298,Salomons Estate,"We knew instantly when we arrived to view the venue that this was where we wanted to get married. We were made to feel at home, and nothing felt like too much bother. The team were constantly on-hand to answer questions throughout the process, and catered to all of our requests. We had never really thought about an outside wedding, but the South Terrace took our breath away when we saw it in person!
Our wedding day was magical, and ran completely smoothly due to the hard work of the team throughout the day. Our guests commented on the service of the team - there was never a queue at the bar, there was always someone on-hand to help out, and our wedding planner (Fiona) had this magic ability of being everywhere at once! The food was outstanding, and our guests were well-fed and watered during the day. We honestly couldn’t have asked for more from the team!"
V298,Salomons Estate,"We got married at Salomons Estate in June 2023 and it was incredible! We literally have zero negatives to write. Everything from Fiona and her team was brilliant. The care and attention to detail, the day went smoothly and perfect.
All of our guests commented on how delicious the canapés and food were.
We will 10000% be returning for our anniversary.
Thank you everyone at Salomons for ensuring we had the most perfect day."
V299,The Castle Westenhanger,"We had our special day here in April 2024 and all we can say is incredible!

The booking process was easy and so personal, the online planning system was so easy to use and the Westenhanger team were always at the end of an email if we needed anything at all - nothing was too much trouble.
The day went perfectly to plan thanks to the wonderful wedding coordinators, the food was amazing, the DJ was brilliant - genuinely there was nothing we would have changed.

We can’t thank the Westenhanger team enough for everything that they have done in making sure that our wedding day was perfect."
V299,The Castle Westenhanger,"We had an incredible day and are still getting so many compliments from our guests and suppliers on how beautiful the different parts of the castle and its grounds are. It was an unusual wedding (queer Jewish/Christian interfaith), but Jackie, Vicky and co helped to make sure that we had all the things that were important to us, from the vegan food and alcohol-free drinks to the gender neutral toilets to getting the dancing going before the meal had even started. The ceremony room was perfect (and a special thank you to the person who went up on a ladder to put a covering over the boar head that's mounted on the wall!), and we had some amazing photos and videos back from our photographers/videographer highlighting the beauty across the entire venue. We also really appreciate that the company running the venue sent many of the key staff members on trans awareness training so that we could have the most gender-affirming day possible. Thank you Westenhanger team!"
V299,The Castle Westenhanger,"This place is a gem and an absolutely stunning setting for special occasions. We had our daughter’s wedding there in June. The staff were attentive from the moment we first visited to look around, to the time we left having packed up everything the morning after the wedding. The food was delicious and generous portions the drinks were flowing. The castle is authentic and steeped in history which gives it a magical atmosphere."
V299,The Castle Westenhanger,"I can honestly say hand on heart that a typical ‘Wedding’ was not a bit of me. However, there is nothing Typical about Westernhanger.

The magic is created as soon as you walk in and even more so on my day as we had snow!! Transported into a winter wonderland with the most beautiful atmosphere and decorations.

The staff were honestly so incredible and I cannot even begin to thank you for guiding me through my day. You took everything out of my hands and I trusted you all. Your professionalism and expertise ensured that our day ran smoothly. Every single guest commented on how amazing the dinner service was and so professional. Also the food was stunning.

The evening DJ was great and although I took a turn for the worst, due to a sickness bug I couldn’t help but get up and boogie. The evening guests shared that the buffet was incredible.

On behalf of my Husband and I we would like to thank you all for creating and being a part of the most magical day. And if you’re anything like me and do not do ‘Typical’ this is the place for you. Westernhanger will always have a place in our hearts and we’ve made our own history in this incredible historical place."
V299,The Castle Westenhanger,"The team at Westenhanger were so warm and welcoming. We had travelled from up north to come down and looked at multiple venues. The castle was the only venue that we got emotional at. It is gorgeous. We had a huge numbers of friends and family travel down for the day, and many have said it's the best wedding they've ever been to. We did find that perhaps coordination was slightly lax for us, but that could be more of a criticism of ourselves. A really, really lovely team of people. Thank you!"
V299,The Castle Westenhanger,"Tania, Jackie and Bex are an absolutely amazing team. We had such a chill wedding day with everything running smoothly. The Castle grounds are beautiful and looked amazing in the October sunshine. The inside of the castle is perfect for the ceremony and the marquee is great for the reception. We really wanted photos in the dovecote and they turned out lovely."
V299,The Castle Westenhanger,"Westenhanger Castle is an absolutely amazing wedding venue! From the moment we set foot on the grounds, we were blown away by its beauty and historical charm. The staff at Westenhanger Castle couldn't have been more helpful throughout the entire wedding planning process. They went above and beyond to ensure that our special day was perfect in every way.

The team at Westenhanger Castle was incredibly accommodating, helping us with every aspect of our wedding, from selecting the ideal ceremony location to assisting with catering and decorating decisions. Their professionalism and dedication to making our day unforgettable were truly remarkable.

Our guests were also captivated by the beauty of the venue and the warmth of the staff. We received numerous compliments about the exceptional service and the incredible ambiance throughout the day.

In conclusion, Westenhanger Castle is not just a wedding venue; it's a fairytale setting where dreams come true. We couldn't have asked for a better place to start our journey together, and we are immensely grateful for the exceptional support we received from the staff. If you're looking for a wedding venue that combines history, beauty, and exceptional service, Westenhanger Castle is the perfect choice"
V299,The Castle Westenhanger,All the staff from start to Finnish and after are amazing. From enquiries to information and service. Spectacular venue. If you’re looking for honestly care love and so much more. This is the venue. No faults here. Food is wonderful. Would highly recommend!! Zach and jo
V299,The Castle Westenhanger,"From our first meeting, the staff were so welcoming, knowledgeable and responsive to any queries we had throughout the planning process. We had a lot of guests with dietary requirements, so the choice of menus was important to us when choosing a venue. There was a great selection of meals to choice from and the chefs were accommodating where we needed to tweak things!

The venue itself is of course stunning and a real stand out feature is the space for both the bridal party and groomsmen to get ready for the big day! All the staff on the day made sure everything went smoothly and we were able to relax and enjoy the day!"
V299,The Castle Westenhanger,"We cannot recommend The Castle at Westenhanger enough. Quite simply the best. A totally professional team who made our day so special. Everyone and everything was perfect and far exceeded our expectations. On top of this, the team really did make us feel more like friends than customers and really did seem as excited as we were about the day. From day one of planning to clearing up our things the day after, we were met with smiles and hugs and made to feel genuinely special. If you want good old fashioned professional service wrapped in the friendliest of company at a venue that looks stunning, then you have found the perfect venue in Westenhanger."
V300,Lympne Castle,"We couldn't be happier with how our wedding turned out. The venue is just stunning - a beautiful castle, lovely grounds, and overlooking the sea. We had a very small wedding of 15 guests, and we were treated like royalty. We had access to the full castle and spent the day wandering between different sections, enjoying every single one. The food (we had a BBQ) was delicious, and the staff were wonderful. It was all coordinated by Joy who was a pleasure to work with. She spent the day seamlessly coordinating everything behind the scenes, whilst looking after and playing with our dog which was such an appreciated touch! We stayed at the cottages on the castle and they were fantastic. Not only big and full of character, but it also made logistics so much easier having our guests at the location. The new castle bistro (the Naughty Dog) also meant everyone had a place to meet, drink and eat inbetween wedding events.

The best thing about the castle is that it caters for all types of weather. So no matter what you get on the day, you'll still have an incredible experience.

Finals things: the photos you'll get will be outstanding. What a backdrop! And the prices are extremely reasonable. We highly highly recommend this venue."
V300,Lympne Castle,"Great venue, beautiful and so many amazing comments from our guests. The different rooms and spaces made it more and gave the variety we wanted

The team also worked very well to be flexible with last minute changes to make it work and I can’t thank them enough for that

The views are stunning"
V300,Lympne Castle,"So we got married in the church (next door) and hired out one of the rooms in the castle for our reception.

I can’t fault the service. It was spectacular and really made our day special. I don’t think I’ve ever had service like that where the staff are so professional, personable and just amazing all round. We were aware that we didn’t hire out the venue or anything like that specifically for our wedding - it was a room in the castle so we didn’t really expect much. But the staff made us feel like we did. They even roped in some of the gardeners to pull smoke bombs for one of our pictures! The staff made every effort. Laura and Mike were great and went beyond expectations. We just have no complaints at all with anything. It was an amazing day.

The castle itself is picture perfect and for us was the perfect setting. It’s rich in history and the attention to details is incredible. There’s multiple rooms of varying sizes. We had a small wedding so hired out one of the smaller rooms but it looks like they can cater to a wedding of any size. We also stayed in one of the cottages within the castle grounds along with the guests which were equally perfect.

Pretty much every wedding I’ve been to the food has been mediocre at best. But the food here was great. Everybody really enjoyed the food. The kitchen obviously know what they’re doing so kudos to them.

This is honestly the best place to have your wedding. You’re in very safe hands with the staff here, the castle is gorgeous (and the views!) and the we couldn’t think of a better place to do it.

Thank you for the special day!"
V300,Lympne Castle,"Our wedding day was absolutely faultless from start to finish! The wedding team were so helpful and knowledgable throughout the planning process and our coordinator Dan looked after us for our wedding day - thank you Dan!
Lympne Castle is such a beautiful venue, and we can't wait to visit again once the castle bedrooms are ready!
Love, Sarah & Tom"
V300,Lympne Castle,"From start to finish, the staff at Lympne Castle were amazing. Professional, courteous, and incredibly helpful. We planned our own wedding, and although I feared it would become overwhelming, Kate made it so easy for us. The day came off without a hitch and everything was just beautiful, from the venue to the food. I am so grateful to all the wonderful staff, Kate and Mike, Joy, and all the sweet and charming servers. You made our wedding perfect!"
V300,Lympne Castle,"Lympne Castle could not have made our wedding day more special, it was a beautiful and intimate occasion from start to finish. We got to decorate the chairs as we liked and having the rooms to get changed in made it very easy in the end. The food was good and the staff very helpful, especially Mike and Laura. Everything was thought about and all ideas welcomed and accommodated where possible. We had the best day and would repeat it in a heartbeat to soak it all up again. The castle was a little bit of history that made the start of our adventure even more magical. Thank you to everyone at Lympne Castle."
V300,Lympne Castle,"Lympne Castle was truly perfect in every way. The Bridal Suite is stunning and was such a great space to enjoy the morning with my bridal party. We were lucky enough to get married on the lawn outside, the view is unbelievable and our guests were wowed! Our wedding breakfast was held in the Great Hall and genuinely felt like something out of a fairytale. The food throughout the day was amazing and the staff were so attentive and accommodating - especially our wedding coordinator Kate (we can’t thank you enough!!). I’d recommend Lympne Castle in a heart beat and our guests still talk about how magical the venue was - can we do it again please?! Love, Mr & Mrs J"
V300,Lympne Castle,"I could not imagine anywhere else more perfect for a wedding. It was our first and only venue viewing, we fell so in love with it that we booked a date there and then. We loved that our ceremony, reception and accommodation (we used the cottages) were all within the grounds plus the added bonus of the new bridal preparation room. We also had the benefit of Christmas trees and log fires which made our winter wedding particularly festive in the castle setting. The building and views are stunning - our guests were in awe! Aimee, our coordinator was first class in communications, expertise and ensuring the preparations and day ran to schedule. Nothing was too much trouble for her, even helping the grooms party with their buttonholes, a kind and personal touch. The staff were fabulous too and made us all smile with their lovely comments about our celebrations. The brilliant chefs offer an impressive menu, catering for all dietary choices and it is both delicious and beautifully presented. Lympne Castle had everything we could have wished for and more, it is a truly special venue, one of a kind."
V300,Lympne Castle,"Lympne Castle is the most perfect wedding venue. Not only is it absolutely stunning, has roaring fires, beautiful grounds and views but you get the whole venue exclusive which for us was a big bonus!

From the moment we booked it as a venue we were assigned a wedding coordinator - ours was Aimee and she was fantastic! Anything we needed she was super quick to reply and so helpful. We visited the castle lots and went to one of their dinner nights (which I highly recommend.) Our wedding day couldn't have been as smooth as it was if it wasn't for Aimee and her staff they made everything so easy for us and she even held my umbrella and helped me across to the church in the morning.

Everything that the staff do is perfect - the food is superb and the whole venue flows nicely for guests. If you are thinking of getting married here look no further or even for a party - it's a fantastic venue and you won't be disappointed."
V300,Lympne Castle,"well what can I say!! an amazing venue with fantastic staff. From beginning to end we were given so much personal service from everyone at the castle but Aimee was amazing!!! from small little touches around the castle to making me and my now husband feel calm before the big moment...Aimee must have had a Mary Poppins bag as she had everything we needed on hand from sewing kits to mints, scissors and glue and we couldn't have asked for a better day. Thank you for making our day so special ...even to the last touch of a hug goodbye this morning ."
V301,Chafford Park,Amazing venue for our wedding in the summer. Alicia and Sarah worked really hard to make sure we had the best day possible. Both the indoor and outdoor ceremony areas are beautiful and the main barn is a perfect setting for food and dancing. Couldn’t recommend highly enough.
V301,Chafford Park,"Chafford Park is a beautiful hidden gem in the glorious English countryside. From the moment we visited, we felt welcomed and really put at ease by the team and the family. The grounds are stunning, with so many opportunities to explore and capture our favourite moments!
With of having use of the two spacious barns to use we were able to really bring our vision to life, and the day panned out perfectly. The venue hire includes the day before your wedding to set everything up, and we booked to stay in the onsite accommodation in the Long Barn (a must!), which really put my nerves at ease knowing that everything was taken care of before the day.

Sarah and the team were extremely helpful, ensuring we had everything we needed for the day. All of our suppliers went above and beyond, the waiting and bar team were super attentive and great fun!

We had so many of our guests commenting on the venue, the service and the day itself, we just couldn't have asked for more.

We honestly couldn't have imagined our day being any better, we are still on a high from the entire day and cannot recommend this venue highly enough. Thank you so much!!"
V301,Chafford Park,"We knew we wanted to hold our big day at Chafford Park as soon as we first visited the previous spring. We always wanted a venue which was a blank canvas that we could put our own stamp on and it was perfect for this, with the two beautiful barns for us to dress and decorate for the ceremony and wedding breakfast and free reign on our choice of cater, but with a emphasis on trying to keep it local which we liked. The journey for the bridal party from the house to the ceremony barn is beautiful too, passed the pond and through the trees.

As we both work in events we loved having the bell tents as the backdrop for our friends to stay in and having the fire pits and festoon at night time gave the outside area a real festival feel.
It was also a big plus that we could stay on site for two nights - we legally got married on the Friday with a small group of family and friends and then cooked a big meal in the house that night.

Alicia and Sarah were helpful and prompt with any queries in the lead up and we’re very grateful to Charlotte who made sure everything ran smoothly for us on the day itself too.

We hope to return one day for a glamping weekend and to reminisce."
V301,Chafford Park,"We recently celebrated our wedding at Chafford Park, and it was an absolute dream!

The team's dedication to making our wedding unforgettable, from the initial planning stages to the last dance, the staff demonstrated a fabulous level of commitment. They took care of every detail, ensuring that our vision came to life seamlessly.

Our guests couldn't stop raving about the stunning venue. The charm of the barns, coupled with the picturesque surroundings, created a warm and romantic atmosphere that perfectly complemented our day. The natural beauty of Chafford Park added an extra layer of magic to our celebration, making the entire weekend feel like a fairytale. Waking up in the long barn was nothing short of glorious. The tranquillity of the setting and the connection with nature created a serene and peaceful atmosphere. It was the perfect way to start our journey as a married couple.

We loved having the use of two barns one for the ceremony and the other for our reception and the transition from one space to another was seamless, and it made the entire event flow effortlessly. We appreciated the thoughtfulness behind this arrangement, allowing us to savour every moment without any stress.

Our experience at Chafford Park was beyond our wildest dreams. If you're looking for a venue that combines natural beauty, thoughtful design, and a dedicated team, Chafford Park is the perfect choice."
V301,Chafford Park,"Could not recommend Chafford Park more. It is such a beautiful venue and the team are constantly improving and adding extra touches to the venue.

I loved the ability to chose our own caterers - I was able to bring in my African heritage by choosing an African caterer and it really made the day feel unique and special to us.

The sound system is unusual but once you are underneath it, it is great. We worked with a recommend DJ and saxophonist from Mint DJs who were really great and got the party started.

The added touch of having rooms on site for the family really made it easier. We were able to have a lovely family dinner the night before and able to enjoy the farm for the full three days.

Really was our dream day and we are so grateful."
V301,Chafford Park,"Where to start...what a beautiful wedding venue. So picturesque and relaxed. The grounds feel luxurious and private without losing the homely aspects we wanted for our special day. We knew when we looked at Chafford Park that it was the perfect place for our wedding. Sarah, Alicia and Catherine are an excellent team who have an eye for detail and really made sure we were looked after throughout the lead up and on the day. All questions are answered promptly and with care. The landscaped area around the stunning barns provide a perfect backdrop for photos and the barns made the most intimate space for our ceremony and reception. We are so grateful for the time and care to make our day so special. Highly recommend to go and view Chafford park and find out why it is just so special."
V301,Chafford Park,"Even though we had torrential rain on the day, Catie and Sarah made the day flow really well. All staff were incredible and so friendly. The grounds are incredible too. We wanted a laid back wedding with a slight rustic vibe and this delivered! Thank you all, I just wish I could do it all again xx"
V301,Chafford Park,"By far the most beautiful wedding location I have been to. The estate owners and staff were so professional and truly went above and beyond to make my sisters wedding the most special day of her life. Thank you Sarah, Alicia and the team! X"
V301,Chafford Park,"Despite the stunning facade of this venue, its owners and managers are incredibly rude, making planning and having a wedding at Chafford Park an uncomfortable experience.

On our first visit before booking, we loved what the venue offered and how beautiful it was. Sarah the owner was pleasant and kind and we consequently booked a week later.
However after booking, there followed 12 months of terrible communication, pulling back on previous promises made and generally being very uncompromising with our plans.
We didn’t feel Sarah or her daughter Alicia were on our side at any point and felt that they were more concerned about keeping their venue pristine than helping people have a beautiful wedding.

We had such a magical wedding day, despite them. Our guests and vendors contributed to an incredible day and I didn’t feel stressed at all. But behind the scenes, our catering staff and wedding coordinator were having to deal with so much hostility from the managers. They came in, in the middle of service to tell the staff that the kitchen area was too messy!! So incredibly rude and completely unprofessional. And this was only one incident amongst many that I heard post wedding where they were rude and disrespectful towards vendors and guests alike.

You are also obliged to partner with Wild Box to serve the drinks when you book this venue - they work closely with Chafford Park so essentially are almost as hostile. There are many things that you can’t do - put up your own decorations, bring your own alcohol or have a campfire past midnight. We luckily found our way around all of this but they made the whole thing so difficult and uncomfortable.

I would encourage anyone to not be lured in by the beautiful surroundings and look elsewhere if you want a more friendly and compromising service."
V301,Chafford Park,"We had the most amazing wedding at Chafford Park! It really is the most stunning venue, especially in June when everything is in full bloom. We really wanted as many of our friends to be able to stay with us across the whole weekend and this venue offered just that. The Glamping tents were a huge hit with our guests and the long barn where we stayed was beautiful (and perfect for getting all the girls glammed up on the big day!) Being able to access the venue from Friday morning until Sunday midday meant we could fully enjoy time with firends and family who had travelled so far to be with us.

Alicia and Sarah were so helpful, making sure everything was just as we wanted it and that the day ran smoothly. We couldn’t have pictured a more perfect place for our wedding and can’t wait to return for some more glamping in the years to come!"
V302,The Ferry House,"Where do we start with this review? Well, if you are looking for a venue that has practically everything this is it. The staff are fantastic, they were brilliant from the day we booked it and even after the event. They were helpful all the way through the journey and on the day the staff we great. Our guests had the most amazing time and all said it was one of the best weddings they had been too. Granted the weather helped, but a mild sunny day in April made it perfect. The food was 10 out of 10, really do recommend the upgrade on the menu choices and wine. The in house DJ was also excellent. In fact everything went to plan, there was nothing negative just the perfect magical day."
V302,The Ferry House,"We got married at the Ferry House last Saturday and had the most amazing magical day and that was all down to the incredible team at The Ferry House.
Sam & Chloe were our wedding coordinators on the day and they were absolutely faultless, the day ran perfectly and that was all down to them both.
The food was incredible and every one of our guests commented on how amazing the food quality was.
The rooms were super comfortable.
The venue overall was just incredible, we would highly recommend anyone getting married to celebrate here.
Thank you all"
V302,The Ferry House,"This venue is a hidden gem, we didn't know about it until we were looking at Venues and we instantly knew this was the place for us. Relaxed, rustic, caring and everything in one place! The venue itself is so warm and inviting with the log burning fires, rustic bar, barn and amazing surroundings. The team go above and beyond to make your day extra special.
The food selection is amazing, we had the hog roast which everyone commented on!
Thank you to everyone at The Ferry House, our day was amazing!"
V302,The Ferry House,"Our winter wedding at The Ferry House was just perfect, and that is all thanks to the amazing team. The care and attention to detail they had to understanding our vibe and making our vision come to life was just second to none. We have so many amazing memories of the day and also the planning stages. The setting was beautiful, the food and drink were amazing, and the staff were all super friendly.
All of our guests loved everything about the day and are still talking about it now.
Thank you so much for making our wedding dreams come true, core memory made!"
V302,The Ferry House,"Our special day tailored to our exact requirements, staff professional from original viewing to the day, cannot thank them enough, what they always say about a good place is the staff make the venue, and they sure do at the ferry house. Beautiful venue in picturesque surroundings worth every penny"
V302,The Ferry House,"The Ferry house is an absolutely amazing , our wedding day was magical .
Our guests all said what a beautiful venue .
The food is outstanding and all the staff are very helpful. From the first planning meeting up to the day of the wedding .
Nothing was to much trouble if I had a query they was always at the end of email .
Myself and the bridal party stayed at the cottages the night before , this really added to the excitement of our wedding day .
The rooms at the Ferry house are decorated to a high standard and are very comfortable. The food is amazing.
We would highly recommend this venue . Our wedding day was perfect ."
V302,The Ferry House,"I don’t even know where to start - the Ferry House was the perfect venue for our big day. Nothing was too much trouble and they made the whole planning process so easy. I have worked at weddings myself and know how venues can sometimes be difficult and reluctant to help with certain things but not the Ferry House!
They decorated the venue with my diy decorations without any issues, they answered my constant emails (crazy quickly!) and even put up with me doing everything last minute!
The actual day itself, they were so helpful, excited for us and just made us feel amazing!
The venue is just absolutely gorgeous - nearly every guest came up to us on the day to tell us how amazing it was and they honestly felt it was the best wedding they had been to! All thanks to the Ferry House. If we could do it all again we would both choose the ferry house again in an instant."
V302,The Ferry House,"We just wanted to say a huge thank you to the whole Ferry House team for all of their hard work, support, kindness and helpfulness in making our day so incredibly perfect. Our guests were so amazed, and keep telling us as much!

It wouldn't have been as wonderful without the team all part of it, and Josh was the best DJ! He played some absolute tunes. Owen took great care of everyone down by the firepit.

Chef and his team put out some absolutely incredible food, everyone has been raving about it since. The food was simply perfect, we're having roast dinner withdrawals at this point....

Katy took care of me and pampered me for six months in the run up to the wedding with the facials, definitely one of the best parts of wedding planning, she got rid of any worries in each session, I will definitely be continuing with those, I miss her already! They should be a must for every bride to be!

Maxine & Georgina, where can we start? They were both the most organised, reassuring, fantastic team, they were truly perfect, being the calming voices of reason, and helping move everything indoors in the morning.

We would write an essay about how amazing each and every one of the Ferry House team are. Every single one of the Ferry House team are truly one in a million, and TFH are very lucky to have them all."
V302,The Ferry House,"Our son has just been married at The ferry house.
From start to finish the staff and wedding team have been incredible!
The attention to detail, care and kindness of all the staff is the best we have ever received. They were simply amazing.
The venue itself, is totally worth the journey .
It was absolutely stunning and took our breath away when we saw it decorated.
We stayed overnight and the rooms were beautiful, clean and really comfortable.
Our buffet breakfast in the morning was delicious, full of fresh produce.
The food did not disappoint, it was the best wedding breakfast meal we have had.
Congratulations on a top star venue and a brilliant team of staff from the washing up lady to the wedding planners (Maxine was especially brilliant and also our assigned host who never stopped smiling despite our requests for this and that).
Thank you one and all for making Harry & Dan’s day totally amazing! We couldn’t have asked for more ."
V302,The Ferry House,"The best team of people you could ask for! Every single person we spoke with was so helpful and lovely to deal with. They made our day so special and run seamlessly! We couldn’t have asked for a better team!
The food and drink is the best around, locally sourced making it all taste so much better! And the views, away from everything so you can really soak in the day with your loved ones with no distractions!
Couldn’t ask for more"
V303,Hayne House,"I fell in love with Hayne House the second we went to our viewing and it only got better from there.
The pre-wedding process with the team at Hayne House was amazing, they were so accommodating and responsive and had answers to all the question that my Type A Bride brain threw at them. Throughout the planning process they were fabulous and it was so nice to find a venue where we could both get ready on site in the morning.
On the day, the Hayne House team (Beth) were absolutely fabulous. Beth kept me calm all morning and made me feel like we were in safe hands. We DIY-ed all our decor and Beth asked my input on the set up before the Groom turned up which really put me at ease. Beth also managed our ceremony music on a phone and it just made me feel so comfortable. Pre-aisle walk, Beth really helped me understand what would happen and really set my nerves at ease. The whole team were incredible and they made our day so so perfect.
We couldn't have asked for more. The venue is stunning and the team are amazing! I would recommend Hayne House to absolutely anyone! We also really loved the sustainability initiative, as we're both conscious of that, and that's what initially made us look at Hayne House. 100000% would recommend!"
V303,Hayne House,"We were married at Hayne House in August 2024, it was one of only 2 venues we selected to view at relatively short notice (we decided to give ourselves only 6 months planning time and were lucky they had availability for our chosen weekend!) - Sam was the first person we met and so welcoming. She really helped us imagine, in the cold of winter, how our summer wedding could be. We absolutely fell in love with the orangery from seeing the photos, but the reality was even better. Our key criteria was a venue that felt like a summer garden party, and you really got a sense of the lovely grounds by being able to see out to them all around you, even from inside the venue.
Becky gave us some great guidance throughout the planning, and Ella and team made the day run very smoothly.
6 months later, our guests are still talking about the beautiful relaxing day - it was everything we imagined - and better!"
V303,Hayne House,"Safe for the children to run around already beautiful so don't need to much decoration, staff couldn't of done any more on the day to help."
V303,Hayne House,"Hayne House was absolutely perfect.
The wedding Co ordinator Ella was so professional. She kept everyone calm and organised throughout the day. Would highly reccomend Hayne House as a wedding venue everything was fantastic!"
V303,Hayne House,"Hayne House was just the most perfect setting for our wedding. It’s private and beautiful surroundings coupled with amazing staff, food and suppliers - we couldn’t have asked for more or had a better day."
V303,Hayne House,We couldn’t have asked for a more superb venue and team! They made sure we had everything we needed on the day and we’re just so kind and helpful leading up to the wedding. They answered all our queries super quickly and the whole day just felt like a breeze!
V303,Hayne House,Hayne House is a beautiful wedding venue with a amazing team of staff! They supported us every step of the way and made sure everything ran smoothly on the day. They go above and beyond to make sure everything is perfect. I would especially recommend Hayne House if you have children as they are free to play the entire day! We had so many comments from guests about how beautiful the venue is and how amazing the staff are.
V303,Hayne House,"The team have curated a flawless operation at Hayne House which is so clear. The team ensured the day ran seamlessly and were amazing throughout the day and also during the lead up to our wedding which made it so stress-free and easy for us! There was not one thing that we needed to worry about on the day, the team handled EVERYTHING!! We had the best day and we're so pleased we chose Hayne House for our wedding, it was perfect!"
V303,Hayne House,"Had our wedding at Hayne House in June 2023- cannot fault a single thing with the team, services or facilities. Am so glad we chose Hayne House and would recommend to anyone wanting to get married stress free with a fantastic team who truly take the pressure off of wedding planning and are extremely flexible with requests and adjustments. Very good value for money and honestly all expectations were exceeded! Everything was well thought of and planned, there were no surprises and communication was excellent from the moment we made initial contact. Was such a special and memorable day due to the efforts and high quality of care and services at Hayne House."
V303,Hayne House,"As soon as we saw Hayne House we knew it was the perfect venue. The team are so welcoming and lovely. To the lead up to the big day they helped with everything. On the big day they may us feel at ease. I cannot recommend this venue enough, all of our guests said what a beautiful venue it is. They made our day so special, we enjoyed every little bit of it, thank you to all the team!"
V304,Bradbourne House,"My son had his wedding at Bradbourne House, the venue was beautiful, the staff were so helpful from start to finish, food was absolutely amazing, the toastmaster was a credit to the venue making this a day him and his new wife will never forget I would thoroughly recommend Bradbourne House for a wedding venue."
V304,Bradbourne House,"We had our reception here from the moment we arrived we were looked after and our guests were well informed. Hannah was fantastic and made our evening run smoothly and nothing was too much for her, she even helped me with my dress before my first dance and always asked if I was okay. Lauren was our first point of contact and she is lovely as is Rebecca. Thank you all so much. I would definitely recommend Bradbourne house not just for its beauty and privacy but for its team too."
V304,Bradbourne House,"On Saturday 27th October 2018 Julie and I had our renewal of Vows celebration at Bradbourne house, from our initial contact with Lauren at the Wedding Fair to the tasting menu to the day itself was a professional and dedicated service.

Bradbourne House has understood our requirements and ensured that the delivery of these were met without fuss or bother.

The food delivered from the Head Chef from Canapes to Wedding Breakfast to the Hog roast in the evening was first class.

The day itself ran like clockwork and the staff were again professional in their duties to ensure that all our guests were looked after.

It was a 5 star experience and we are already booking for our milestone birthdays in the next year or so.

A special thanks to Lauren and Head Chef who went beyond the call of duty to make it that special."
V304,Bradbourne House,"To all the fabulous staff and Bradbourne House, thank you so very much for your wonderful wedding organisation, wine knowledge, kitchen and food skills and ability to put on a great day as a team. You are all fantastic and a real asset to your employers. We are so very glad that we chose you as our venue. A no hassle and pleasant experience from start to finish. Wonderful! Thank you!"
V304,Bradbourne House,"From start to finish, Bradbourne House was wonderful in delivering the most perfect wedding reception for us. The house and gardens are absolutely beautiful and give you a great amount of space. What really made it was the staff. Everyone from the events team who worked with us for months beforehand, to the fantastic team on the day who thought of everything we hadn't and were there whenever we needed them. It meant we were free to enjoy the company of our guests and not worry about a thing. Perfect day and can't recommend it enough for a dream wedding venue."
V304,Bradbourne House,"To all at Bradbourne House.

Just a big thank you for making the Wedding of Paul and David such a memorable day. The venue was delightful and everything you did made it the most wonderful occasion. Everyone said it was the best wedding they had ever attended! The weather, the setting, the staff and the food was absolutely perfect.

So as the mother of Paul i thank you so much for a day to remember, it was absolutely flawless.
Thank you all again."
V304,Bradbourne House,Just a little note to say a big thank you for making our day run so smoothly. It all went perfectly for us and everybody was so complimentary of Bradbourne House.
V304,Bradbourne House,"To all at Bradbourne... thanks so much for making it a super special day for me and Emma. Your whole team was superb, especially Charlotte, and made the day very easy for us. We had so many nice comments from guests about the venue, the food and the staff. A few pics as requested!"
V304,Bradbourne House,"We just wanted to say a massive thank you to all of you and the fantastic team that helped make the day special!
The staff and service were all exceptional and nearly all the guests commented on the high standard of service and professionalism of your team. Food... Amazing!!

Thank you all so much. You took the pressure off before and during the wedding and delivered to us a day that no one will forget for a long time to come."
V304,Bradbourne House,"I attended Bradbourne House on Saturday 18th June for my cousin wedding.

I am unable to eat wheat/gluten so passed this on to the bride and groom beforehand.

I am just getting in touch to say how great your staff were at facilitating my needs! The food was delicious and they made sure it was gluten free for me. In the evening fish and chips and bacon sandwiches were being served. I was unable to have the fish as covered in wheat but a very kind gentleman brought me out two bacon sandwiches in gluten free rolls. This was very much appreciated. I was also advised the chips were gluten free!

Thank you for being so accommodating. It is much appreciated!"
V305,Westerham Golf Club,"We cannot express how grateful and happy we were with Westerham Golf Club. All of the staff were amazing and our event managers made sure we were always kept up to date and incredibly quick to reply (even though we bombarded them with our silly questions!) They made us feel so at ease and took care of all the little details they we didn't even think of! The food was delicious and they ensured that everyone was catered for. If you want a beautiful, seamless wedding experience, Westerham Golf Club is the place to book!"
V305,Westerham Golf Club,"Everything about this venue was just perfect. From our first visit up until our wedding date, the team at Westerham were so helpful and always on hand to answer any questions. On the day, the team had everything under control and the whole day went smoothly - not to mention the incredible views!"
V305,Westerham Golf Club,"We honestly cannot recommend Westerham Golf Club enough as a wedding venue! From the moment we first reached out to inquire, the team made everything so easy and stress-free. The events manager and the coordinating team were absolute professionals, and they went above and beyond to ensure that our big day was flawless.

Everything about the day was incredibly well-organised. From the ceremony to the reception, everything flowed so seamlessly. We didn’t have to worry about a single thing as the team had every detail covered. It was amazing to be able to relax and enjoy the moment, knowing that the entire team had everything under control.

The venue itself is absolutely stunning, with beautiful views and a warm, welcoming atmosphere. The level of care and attention the staff gave us was exceptional. The events manager was always there to offer support and guidance, and they were just so kind and approachable. The entire team worked in perfect harmony, and their professionalism shone through at every step.

Our guests had an unforgettable time, and I’m so grateful to the team at Westerham Golf Club for making our wedding day so memorable. If you’re looking for a wedding venue that offers top-tier service, incredible organisation, and a beautiful setting, Westerham Golf Club is the perfect choice!"
V305,Westerham Golf Club,"We visited many venues before deciding on Westerham. What stood out right away was how lovely and welcoming the staff were on that initial visit, they really made us feel like no question was too silly to ask. And of course the setting - we initially wanted an outdoors wedding but knew that there'd be the risk of bad weather, so it was important any outdoor venue would have a great indoor backup. With Westerham, you can't have an outdoor wedding, but the indoor setting, with wide open windows revealing the beautiful landscaped golf course in all directions, meant it was like an outdoor wedding anyway. And it was just as well because on the actual wedding day, there were quite high winds! The team there were so helpful and patient throughout the whole year of planning, and on the day itself. They really put our minds at ease and were really flexible with some of our requests. The reception rooms are great - the smaller one for the ceremony was just the perfect size for our 100 guests, and the larger room for the wedding breakfast and evening celebration was spacious with room to eat, to dance, and to sit to catch your breath. The golf course is a wonderful setting to go out and get your formal photos and some video shot. It's fun to take some of the golf carts up into the wooded area and a chance to have some private moments with your new spouse. It's such a beautiful setting, we would recommend if you can afford it to include some drone footage, for your wedding video because it allows such a great view of the course, the buildings and water features. The food was excellent, in particular the lamb shank, and such huge portions that we struggled to eat a lot later in the evening at the buffet supper. Well worth paying the small extra supplement to allow 2 menu choices plus a veggie/vegan option. They also managed a few tricky dietary requirements really well including Halal and some fairly unique food allergies. Our formal proceedings were capped off by a fireworks display out on the golf course which made for some amazing pictures and video and if you can afford it, we would recommend it. Many guests said it was their favourite part of the evening and a real surprise. We couldn't be happier with our decision to be married here and it's hard now to imagine us getting married at any of the other venues we looked at. You will have a wonderful day no matter what time of year or whatever your theme."
V305,Westerham Golf Club,Amazing staff and amazing place. Loved every minute of my big day. They put in all the effort in to your big day. They made sure the day was perfect
V305,Westerham Golf Club,"Amazing experience from start to finish!
Fell in love with the venue the day we went and viewed it! It was all we imagined!
Gracie was Amazing the whole way through until the big day for us!
I honestly wish I could relive the day!

The day from start to finish is all we ever dreamed off! And I couldn’t recommend this venue enough and the team!"
V305,Westerham Golf Club,"When we began our wedding venue search, our main criteria were:

- good proximity to airport for international guests
- ceremony and reception at the same place, without the need to exit / reset
- no preferred supplier limitations
- kitchen on site (no need to hire externally)
- natural materials, like wood and brick, barn aesthetic
- indoor space we'd be happy not to leave in bad weather
- can have live music with no formal noise limiter
- experienced & supportive team
- budget

Westerham Golf Club delivered all of this and so much more. As soon as we visited the venue for the first time and spoke to the team we were confident we found our venue.

We were assigned a contact person straight away who answered all of our questions by email and phone conversations and was always unbelievably helpful and quick to respond.

In the lead up to the day we met our wedding day coordinators who we were reassured were very on the ball. We had a lot of personal details and touches throughout the day and never felt that we had to remind any of the team about them, they all understood the vision and knew all the intricate details of the day. They delivered them all without fault.

The venue on the day looked absolutely stunning. The exposed brick and beams in the Valence Suite make this feel like a cozy but expansive barn conversion, but with the benefit of the adjoining rooms, wrap around balcony and excellent facilities of the golf club. The views are spectacular and the tree-lined drive up to the venue really sets a great tone.

Throughout the day everything ran like clockwork, guests commented that the food was incredible and all of our suppliers worked with ease with the staff and facilities.

The team set up all our personal and homemade things for us and packed them all away again for easy collection the next morning - we are so so grateful for this!

The flow of the space is fantastic, we had our ceremony in the Eleanor Suite, then did confetti outside before re-entering the main space where the drinks reception were laid out and musicians performing. The bar area, sofas, dance floor and balcony were perfect for the canapes and drinks reception. We had photos on the grounds as well as in the lovely rose garden at the front of the venue. The dinner set up was there from the morning and had a real wow factor when guests first saw it. While Eleanor Suite was empty the chairs were quickly cleared and this became a breakout space where we laid out board games and guests could relax if they didn't want to be dancing with the band.

We got married in November and had a lot of evening guests, so having a space with plenty of room, without anyone needing to go outside (in case of cold/rain) was key and the venue was perfect in this regard. In the end we had a lovely clear day and guests really enjoyed being on the balcony.

I hope this review is helpful in helping other couples choose their venue. For us it was a dream come true and we cannot thank the team enough for delivering a perfect day!"
V305,Westerham Golf Club,"The lead up the wedding was great, Ella helped us with any little questions and made sure everything was sorted!

The day before we met the on the day manager Brad who talked us through the whole day and made sure we were happy with everything. Also when we walked in one of our suppliers hadn’t done what they were meant to - and the venue got on the phone to them right away to come back and sort it meaning the stress was off me!

The day came and it was a blur, but everything went smoothly, my guests couldn’t stop complimenting the venue and how gorgeous it was. Every detail was perfect and the food was amazing! The wine choices were a big hit and I couldn’t be more complimentary of the staff.

The only hiccup we had was when asking for a cup of tea for my Nan during the welcome drinks, and my brother was told they can’t do that by the bar, but my groom went up and it was sorted quickly.

Thanks westerham for a memorable day - that we will cherish always"
V305,Westerham Golf Club,"Westerham is a beautiful venue. The backdrop of the luscious green golf course and the building itself is amazing. The rose garden is the perfect place for a drinks reception - even the drive into the venue is cool!

Now to come onto the staff. Every single one of them couldn’t do enough for us. The communication at every step was faultless, and they are extremely helpful regardless of who you deal with! They are professional and can accommodate a whole variety of things, for example we asked for halal meat and they sourced it without any issue, no extra costs or anything. Their recommended suppliers are great, and they really make you feel at ease throughout the whole process and on the day.

The food is also VERY good. All of our guests were complimentary of that, as well as the decoration and table layout which is rustic and picturesque.

Having the licensed ceremony room in the same venue was perfect, as your guests can simply walk through the door into the wedding breakfast and evening reception room! The bar is well stocked, the wine selection was well received by our guests too.

We really can’t recommend Westerham enough. A few of my friends who were there are now considering it for their wedding venue, it’s that good and I found beat all others on price too!"
V305,Westerham Golf Club,"We made the best decision choosing Westerham Golf Club for our wedding venue. The staff went above and beyond, there are so many photo opportunities on the immaculately kept grounds, and the food was stunning! We had so many compliments from guests on what a fantastic venue we had chosen. The team made the whole wedding planning experience really straight forward, and were always in hand to answer any questions we had. Couldn’t recommend Westerham Golf Club enough!"
V306,The Old Kent Barn,"I could not be happier than we chose to have our wedding at The Old Kent Barn. The care and attention to detail the entire team put into everything they do is unmatched. The venue is absolutely stunning, and so many of our guests commented on how incredible it was. The food was amazing - so filling, tasted amazing and looked just as good. We had Sam as our wedding coordinator and she went above and beyond to ensure we had the best day of our lives. I'm so grateful that we found this venue - as it provided us with the most unforgettable day. Thank you TOKB!"
V306,The Old Kent Barn,"We had our wedding at The Old Kent Barn and couldn’t be happier with our experience. Everything was incredibly well planned and organised from start to finish. The staff were professional, attentive, and genuinely cared about making our day perfect. The venue itself is stunning, with beautiful grounds and a warm, welcoming atmosphere. It made for the most amazing setting for our ceremony and reception. We felt completely supported throughout the planning process and on the day itself. Highly recommend to any couple looking for a seamless and unforgettable wedding experience."
V306,The Old Kent Barn,"We would just like to give a huge heart felt thank you to all of the team at The Old Kent Barn.

We had our special day on a sun filled day on 3rd January 2025 surrounded by all our family and loved ones.
Our wedding was brought forward with 6 months due to doctors advice to my wife.

They couldn’t of been more helpful. Helped us through every step of the way and guided us through the entire process.

This was an absolute god send to my wife who is regularly in and out of Kings College Hospital.
The team took all the stress and worry from us and were always on hand in with any questions.
They were absolutely awesome. They are extremely well organised and ensured everything went well.

Our fairy tale wedding became a reality and we owe this to all the team.

We’d like to give an extra special shout out to Chloe, our wedding co-ordinator. You were awesome!
If anyone is looking for a venue for their special day then look no further than The Old Kent Barn.

You made our fairy tale wedding a reality and we’ll be forever grateful to you all."
V306,The Old Kent Barn,Myself and my husband married at the stunning Old Kent Barn in October and had the best day of our lives. The staff were amazing throughout the whole process from securing a date all the way to end day after the big day. Our wedding coordinator in particular Claire was just amazing and so helpful and resourceful. We would highly recommend the venue to anyone!
V306,The Old Kent Barn,"We got married at TOKB and it was flawless from the very first moment we’ve signed to the wedding day itself.

The whole process was very smooth and they have thought about every little detail. Their portal is very comprehensive and they help you to plan your wedding and make sure you cover every aspect of your day.

They really do go above and beyond and they run the wedding almost military style (in a good way!). They make sure you are on track without being pushy. Everything is done seamlessly and in the background. You never know they are there!

The venue is fantastic and there’s very little you need to do to decorate. It’s just down to individual themes and table decorations. It allows you to take great photos as the venue and the gardens are beautiful.

The food was great. The portions were massive and it tasted great. You won’t be leaving the wedding being hungry.

All in all, they have thought about everything, including the tiniest details. Even at the end of the night, the have made sure that there was some evening food left for us in our bedroom.

We’ve had a great wedding at TOKB and we are very grateful to the venue and the staff for making it perfect."
V306,The Old Kent Barn,"I would recommend TOKB to every single couple out there! They are more than just a venue - the staff here cater to you as if you are family, and gave us the wedding day of our dreams! Each staff member goes above and beyond to ensure your day is perfect, and you get a wedding coordinator who basically ensures everything on the day goes smoothly. They took all the burden of the stress so my partner and I could just be present and enjoy our day. I’m so glad we chose the Old Kent Barn, as my partner and I know not every venue is as thorough and caring as them (from stories from our friends and family about their weddings). Thank you TOKB - we love you!!"
V306,The Old Kent Barn,We chose TOKB as our wedding venue and never once regretted our decision. They have been incredibly supportive through our plethora of questions and thoroughly looked after us from enquiry and beyond the big day. Every single member of staff works extremely hard - from grounds keepers to kitchen staff to bar staff to wedding coordinators - you name it! Nothing is too much trouble for anyone there as they purely want you to have the most special experience with them. I cannot recommend them enough!
V306,The Old Kent Barn,"The Old Kent Barn was the most perfect venue! From the moment my now husband and I went for our first viewing right through until after the wedding the staff at the venue have been amazing - Ashleigh was our wedding coordinator and could not have been more helpful and on the day she was an absolute star and went well beyond her role in helping do things to ensure the day ran smoothly. The venue is STUNNING and the staff set everything up for you so that you can have the most relaxed wedding morning! Our guests could not speak more highly of the food - it was delicious and the chefs team were really accommodating with special requests and dietary needs and allergies etc! My husband and I had the most special wedding day and I highly recommend The Old Kent Barn, you will not regret choosing this as your wedding venue!"
V306,The Old Kent Barn,"We got married at the Old Kent Barn this week. From the minute we first enquired, to the tour, booking, planning, and wedding day were all perfect and so well organized. The staff all go above and beyond and we could not have been any happier. They make the planning process so easy, and we're always there is we needed assistance. The venue is gorgeous, so well maintained, the gardens especially are always being worked on and are gorgeous, we especially loved the pond and ducks!! I would not have changed a thing. The food was brilliant we went for a BBQ and had SO many compliments from our guests, the canapes, deserts and evening food were all amazing as well. Thank you so much for making our day perfect."
V306,The Old Kent Barn,"A week on from our wedding and I’ve come to the conclusion that there are no sufficient words to describe our experience at the barn.
From the minute we booked, the team have been brilliant. They are so responsive, they never leave you waiting for an answer when you email. They are positive, supportive and, most importantly, kind!

I have listened to the podcast ‘The Unfiltered Bride’ for most of the wedding planning and they encourage booking a ‘day of’ coordinator as wedding venues don’t provide the support you need. I can promise, with all my heart, you do not need one at TOKB. I had worried that we’d made a mistake not booking one, but boy did they prove me wrong.
They had at least two people checking on us throughout the morning as well as someone else for my husband, who helped with ties and getting them ready. Yes they were there to coordinate everything from the venue POV, but I did not feel ignored or that I was missing an extra person to help. They were on hand to help get me into my dress, to make sure my bridesmaids were ready. If you listen specifically to episode 74 of ‘The Unfiltered Bride’, everything listed during that episode as something a ‘day of’ coordinator does, is everything the team at TOKB did.

The food at TOKB is sublime. We had the hog roast for wedding breakfast and pizza for the evening. Our guests loved everything about it all, including the canapés. They took all dietary requirements we had in their stride and no-one went hungry.

I could gush about them for hours, they really are excellent."
V307,Leez Priory,"I never in my life thought I would get married in a place like Leez priory! The whole experience from start to finish was just fantastic. The price breakdown was manageable and there was no pressure to take any upgrades offered. The things we got in our package were phenomenal and having a wedding planner was tremendous - our lady (Leanne) was an absolute god send!
They catered to all our needs and we were made to feel so comfortable and nothing was a problem! I’d highly suggest going to an event there before hand, just to get a feel of what it’s like full of people and enjoy their delicious food. We actually enjoyed their entertainer ( singer) so much we hired him for our wedding ☺️
Lee priory is just so beautiful. I can’t speak highly enough x"
V307,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory on the 7th of September 2024. Considering how long they have been a wedding venue, they were pretty flexible with some of the ideas we had for the venue styling that turned out amazingly!

The staff really made the day something special and couldn't have done enough for us. Special mention must be made for Leanne, our wedding planner, who was amazing!

Highly recommend the venue and the incredible team that helped to make our day so special!"
V307,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in October 2024. This venue is stunning both inside and out with immaculately kept grounds and interior. The hospitality in the lead up to and on the day of the wedding was fantastic. The food was also brilliant. Another great perk of this venue is the amount of on site accommodation.

A couple of drawbacks / experiences during our wedding. There are only a few toilets in the main building which kept blocking and overflowing throughout the evening which led to us taking some guests to the dressing room or honeymoon cottage to use the facilities. You are also restricted by the venue on any external food or drink suppliers and the venues optional extras for this are quite expensive for what they are.

That asaide, we had the best day and evening at Leez Priory and would certainly recommend it!"
V307,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in August 2024- great venue and experience from initial viewing to leaving the morning after the wedding. Leanne acted as our wedding planner and was friendly, professional and helpful throughout. We opted for the classic package and the food was amazing quality with everyone commenting how full they were!
The venue is beautiful with several options for ceremony both inside and out. Accommodation was great too. The whole day ran smoothly with perfect weather - we will have very happy memories of our day!"
V307,Leez Priory,"Perfect venue and very attentive staff, lovely food and great communication from start to finish"
V307,Leez Priory,"Stunning venue. Fantastic Team. Very accommodating toward our unique ""surprise"" strategy. Our guests were truly surprised. Thank you."
V307,Leez Priory,"Leez priory was the 1st and only venue we looked around when we started planning our wedding. From the moment we stepped on the premises, everything just looked so perfect and exactly what we wanted from a wedding venue. When we got assigned our wedding co-ordinator Rachel, she was just absolutely spot on with everything we asked for and nothing was too big an ask for her. She made sure the day ran as smoothly as possible and took care of any issue that arose without me knowing (which I am forever grateful for!!)
The rest of the staff were amazing and very helpful.

The venue itself is just absolutely stunning and we loved that it has the pub area as well as the dance floor so it catered to all of our guests.

All of the rooms were lovely and it was so nice being able to stay in the fisherman’s lodge onsite the night before the wedding.

We genuinely cannot recommend this venue enough and it was 100% worth the money! 10/10!"
V307,Leez Priory,"We got married on a Tuesday in October to maximise the value of what we could get for our money; and honestly, we got everything we wanted and more. Leanne, our Wedding Manager was perfect at bringing an attention to detail and seamless organisation to the big day, and in the lead up. There wasn't one moment of the day where we felt stressed, as Leanne had it covered. In one particular instance, our flowers for the bridal party's hair hadn't arrived. Within five minutes of telling Leanne that we needed this, the flowers were with our hair and make-up suppliers to add the finishing touches.

Leez Priory as a venue is the most stunning setting, and offers an incredible range of areas in which the ceremony and reception can take place. There is also the opportunity for the bridal party to make use of the Fisherman's Cottage the night before the wedding, and for people to stay in the on-site accommodation on the evening of the wedding, making it the perfect venue for people also travelling from further afield.

Leez Priory were very accommodating, welcoming and were happy to work with us to make our day as perfect as possible. The food was incredible, and a total hit with all of our guests, and so many people have commented on how incredible the day was as a whole. You wouldn't be disappointed to choose Leez Priory."
V307,Leez Priory,They catered to our every need. To when we would ask for things they hadn’t been done before they still made sure it went smoothly. Leanne was amazing she made me feel so comfortable from the start. The whole day was stunning. Beautiful venue please go view it as you will not be disappointed
V307,Leez Priory,We got married on the 26 May 2024. This venue was absolutely brilliant! They catered for every need and made sure there was no stress on the day. Leanne was kind and level headed throughout and was always one step ahead! Do not hesitate to book- do it now!
V308,Chilston Park,"It’s taken me a while to write this review because it’s hard to put into words how magical my experience with Chilston Park has been. We originally came to Chilston on a whim knowing they had a wedding fair on. The drive up to the hotel is stunning, we were then greeted by Jane, the loveliest and most helpful bundle of joy, Jane became our wedding co ordinator and held my hand every step of the way, we went to every wedding fair from booking last February until our wedding day New Year’s Eve just gone and every time the staff made us feel like family that was visiting. On our day, unfortunately, Jane couldn’t be there but I knew the whole wedding team by then and had no worries that the day would go swimmingly with the amazing Ella, nothing was too much, nothing was answered with no and potential issues were resolved by the time I heard about them. Ella went above and beyond to ensure our day was flawless. Matt, another wonderful human who made it his business to make sure all guests were fed and watered, completed tasks that arose with the biggest smile and again nothing was too much to ask. Multiple guests commented on the efficiency of the staff and great attitudes. We have since been to a sister hotel of Chilston and it really goes to show that everyone can have the same training but the staff truly make a hotel, Chilston is second to none. The venue speaks for itself but these words are for the team because everyone bounced into work, got excited to see us and made us feel like royalty. Paul is clearly a great manager to his team, an absolute asset to Handpicked hotels and a lovely smiley face who even came in on his day off and wished us well. If you’re reading this and looking for a venue, book it, you won’t regret it! We had exclusive use which was great value for money for what it included. The best experience, the best team and the most beautiful venue x"
V308,Chilston Park,"We were so pleased to have had our wedding at Chilston. As soon as we saw the venue, it felt right for us. Its a beautiful venue inside and out. The staff are all excellently trained. From the reception staff, through to the waiting team, through to our wedding coordinator - everyone we met was excellent. We got married off site at a church and were delayed getting back to start our reception at Chilston, but the team were so flexible and made it seem no bother at all. We had such a wonderful day and are looking at being able to go back and stay and Chilston for our anniversary!"
V308,Chilston Park,"We couldn't have asked for more with our wedding at Chilston Park. From the initial booking to the details meeting and then finally the wedding day, everything was pretty much seamless. The wedding day itself went like clockwork and the staff worked so hard to make sure that everything was in place and everyone was in the right place at the right time! All of our guests loved the setting, the food and thought the staff were wonderful. We had a truly wonderful wedding day and that was thanks to the team at Chilston Park/"
V308,Chilston Park,"We viewed lots of potential wedding venues but from the moment we arrived at Chilston Park we just knew it was the place we wanted to hold our wedding. Chloe Rees guided us through the different room options of where we could hold our wedding ceremony as well as have our reception, no question went unanswered and the hotel was very accommodating in helping us deliver our two day dream wedding. Chloe, Paul The Manager and all the staff were fantastic from the start and on the wedding day. Chef, Ali delivered exquisite food for us and our guests, with friends and family still praising it months after. We have been back a few times for afternoon tea and evening meals with all the staff greeting us with such warmth. We have no hesitation in recommending the Chilston Park wedding team and this stunning country setting."
V308,Chilston Park,"Olly and I just wanted to extend our thanks to everyone at Chilton Park for making our wedding on Friday 7th of March 2025 it was so incredible.


Sophie was the first person we spoke to and she made the booking process seamless. She was so helpful in ensuring everything was arranged before her holiday and we are incredibly grateful for her.

The day before the wedding, I had the pleasure of meeting Ella and Ellie, who went above and beyond to assist us. They were both attending our wedding and were genuinely amazing. Ella made our day so special—she took care of everything from cutting the cake to moving things around, so we didn’t have to worry about a thing. She was truly outstanding. Ellie, working behind the bar, was equally fantastic, always with a smile on her face and everyone absolutely adored her.

We can’t thank them enough for making our day unforgettable. Even the morning after the wedding, when we came down for breakfast, Ella was there to greet us with a big smile and get everything ready for us.

Olly and I are already looking forward to returning to Chilton Park when our little one arrives. What a wonderful way to start March!

Thank you again to everyone at Chilton Park, and we hope to see you all again soon.

Best wishes,

The Yeomans!"
V308,Chilston Park,"We got married at Chilston Park in August, and it was nothing short of perfection. We opted for the exclusive use package, which catered to every need. Most of our guest list were international guests, and being able to host everyone comfortably under one roof for the full weekend was incredible. From the food to the helpful staff and gorgeous grounds, I highly recommend choosing Chilston Park for your wedding if you are looking for English elegance. Thank you to the full team who made our dream wedding weekend possible! Big shout out to Sophie for helping us plan for over a year and a half!"
V308,Chilston Park,"We honestly couldn't have wished for any more.
The professionalism and attention to detail was immaculate.
Even though we were a small wedding we were never made to feel less than anyone else."
V308,Chilston Park,"We have just had our special day, and all I can say is from the moment we looked around to the day after the wedding we was well looked after, we had a designated person to speak about our wedding and all our needs were met with no questions asked. The venue and the grounds are stunning, the bedrooms are beautiful and our day was so perfect, I couldn’t fault anything. I just wish we could do it all over again. I would highly recommend Chilston Park as a wedding venue."
V308,Chilston Park,"If you are considering Chilston Park Hotel for your wedding venue let me put your mind at ease.

We got married in Chilston park hotel on the 14th January 2024 and it was the best day of our lives. All our guests are still messaging and calling us telling us what a fantastic time they had, how beautiful the ceremony and the venue are, how through the day they were never hungry and that the food really was amazing.

Although the venue may be second to none it was the staff for me who really make this venue special, the attention to detail is exceptional. From the moment we attended the venue for an open day Jane our event organiser was amazing, Jane always made time to speak to us and communication was always very prompt and very accommodating where she could be. Jane really made the whole process very easy and stress free even with only having a year to plan it all.

On the day of the wedding the team at the venue were nothing short of exceptional. Matt was our point of contact on the day I approached Matt early that morning with a few tasks and like a mind reader had assured me everything had already been taken care of. The day ran faultlessly, it became clear from the beginning of the day that the staff have it down to a fine art which allowed us to just enjoy the day.

I cannot commend or recommend this venue highly enough, thank you again to Jane and Matt and all the staff at Chilston Park Hotel for the day of our lives."
V308,Chilston Park,"Excellent service, made our wedding day a really special memory. Beautiful food, always willing to help us with advice and effort throughout our day. Would recommend for no fuss professional and enjoyable day."
V309,Eastwell Manor,"My husband and I got married at Eastwell Manor in October 2024, and it was everything we dreamed of and more. From the moment we arrived, we were swept away by the breathtaking grounds, the elegant manor, and the warm, welcoming staff who made us feel like royalty.

The entire day was simply magical. The ceremony setting was so romantic – full of charm and character – and the reception felt like something out of a dream. Every detail was perfectly taken care of, and we didn’t have to worry about a thing. The staff were so friendly and helpful, and they truly went above and beyond to make sure everything ran smoothly.

We can't thank the Eastwell Manor team enough for making our wedding so unforgettable. If you’re thinking about getting married here – do it! It’s the most magical, romantic, and beautiful venue you could ask for.

With all our love,
Mr & Mrs Clarke 💕✨"
V309,Eastwell Manor,"My husband and I married here in April 2024. The venue was stunning and guests were impressed with their rooms. The toast master Jim is highly recommended. He really brought the energy into the wedding.
Highly recommended."
V309,Eastwell Manor,"We got married in August 2024 and we had the most stress-free and beautiful wedding. It was raining on the day and our Plan A was for the ceremony to be outside, but on the day it had to be changed to Plan B. The Eastwell Manor team handled the change of plans with such ease, I didn't have to worry about a thing and the end result was better than our original plan! The wedding coordinators at Eastwell Manor are incredibly organised and professional. Jim, the Toastmaster, is an absolute delight and really brought the crowd together. The food was excellent and the tent outside was beautiful at night. We had a beautiful day and are eternally grateful to the team at Eastwell manor for looking after us so well. The rooms are stunning to stay in and the bridal suite is absolutely gorgeous to get ready in with your bridesmaids."
V309,Eastwell Manor,"We would like to say a massive Thankyou to Eastwell and their fantastic team which made our wedding day truly special and unforgettable!
From the first visit we knew Eastwell was the perfect venue for us, from the great layout of the venue to its fantastic facilities, beautiful rooms and ceremony spaces.
The wedding team were all amazing, professional and so friendly and nothing was too much trouble.
Everything organised quickly yand efficiently through email and were always very accommodating and flexible.
We really appreciate everybody’s hard work which made our day the best of our lives!"
V309,Eastwell Manor,"After getting engaged on my 40th birthday, we decided we wanted a Christmas wedding and wanted to plan it within a year. We had Eastwell Manor as one of our venue choices and after viewing it in December 23 (when it was decorated for Xmas) we completely knew it was ‘the one!’. Throughout the year of planning, Dawn and Helen were amazing. Responded to emails etc quickly, helped wherever needed, and it was lovely to have a menu tasting session in a private room. I stayed in the bridal suite the night before. A few of us had dinner in the bar which was very relaxing. The room/suite was beautiful. The bath was amazing (see photos) and I had a lovely morning getting ready for the day ahead. Our wedding was so special. To be surrounded by our guests in such a fabulous venue so beautifully decorated for Christmas, it was magical. Everyone said how great it was. The food taste delicious and was presented well. All the staff were so friendly and helpful. My husband and I stayed in the bridal suite that night and it was just great. I would 100% recommend this venue. Id also recommend a Christmas wedding as the atmosphere is something else. Thanks again Eastwell Manor, Dawn and the team, you are amazing 🤩 Love Mr & Mrs Smith (22.12.24) 🎄 xx"
V309,Eastwell Manor,"We got married at Eastwell Manor in May and honestly, it was the perfect day from start to finish! The venue is absolutely stunning — the grounds, the house, everything just felt like a fairytale. The staff were incredible and made us feel so relaxed and looked after the entire time. They really went above and beyond to make sure everything ran smoothly. The food was amazing, the setup was beautiful, and all our guests were raving about the whole experience. We couldn’t have picked a better place to say “I do”. Massive thanks to everyone at Eastwell Manor — you helped make our day so special and we’ll treasure it forever!"
V309,Eastwell Manor,"We visited Eastwell Manor when looking for venues and instantly fell in love with it. The grounds are so impressive and the inside very homely and comfortable. The wedding team are extremely helpful and professional and helped make our day perfect. The rooms are all lovely, particularly in the manor house and all guests were very happy with them. Particular thanks to Helen, Dawn, Tracey and Chris for the lead up to our big day and for coordinating our day so well without any issues. The food tasting was amazing and had a real personal touch and the food was very well executed on the day with no delays and again our guests have been saying how much they enjoyed it. Our toastmaster Jim was fantastic and also ensured our day went perfectly. Thank you to all of those behind the scenes in the kitchen and the efficient staff who assisted with the wedding breakfast and bar in the evening. Would highly recommend this venue."
V309,Eastwell Manor,"Really lovely venue, the whole day went really smoothly and big thanks to Jim who did an amazing job MCing and corralling the crowd when needed. Really made the day run smoothly, everyone had an awesome time."
V309,Eastwell Manor,"After postponing our wedding and even losing our original venue due to Covid, we knew that finding an alternative that we loved just as much was going to be tough. Eastwell Manor is every bit as beautiful as the photos suggest, and after visiting, we knew we’d found the perfect place for us immediately.
The Maid’s Garden fit our dreams of an outdoor ceremony perfectly with its ivy-lined walls, manicured lawns, pond and Italian gazebo. The terrace with its views overlooking the endless grounds was the ideal space for our reception drinks and canapés, especially on a blue-skied day in June. The wood-panelled Rose Garden Room made the perfect setting for an intimate wedding breakfast with 80 of our closest friends and family. The room was transformed for the evening reception with fairy lights (put up very kindly, and at short notice, by the venue staff) candles and a DJ, with the neighbouring Chaucer Room serving as our bar and a slightly more relaxed setting for our guests. During the evening we also held a barbecue on the terrace as the sun went down with plenty of food for everyone to enjoy.
It’s worth adding that with so much accommodation available in the Manor House and Mews, it really had the feel of a destination wedding. Friends and family were able to stay on-site for a long weekend, giving us the chance to celebrate with them the night before and all enjoy the fabulous spa facilities the day after.
We can’t emphasise enough that all of this was made possible by the outstanding team at Eastwell Manor, who literally could not have done anything more to ensure that we had the best day of our lives. They really did go above and beyond and made us both feel as if the entire hotel was our home for the day. This extends far beyond the exceptional wedding and events team. From the bar and waiting staff always happy and willing to help, to the reception staff that were on-hand at all hours and the incredible chefs that served the best wedding food we have ever had (our guests still talk about the beef!). Helen and Jasmine were a dream to work with, being flexible with all of our requests and doing everything they could to make sure that all of our ideas were realised on the day. A special mention has to go to Chris - an absolute asset to the Eastwell team, he worked tirelessly to ensure everything went without a hitch on the day, and all while looking cool, calm and collected. You really are in excellent hands with this team!
We cannot thank the whole team at Eastwell Manor enough, they gave us our dream wedding day and we wholeheartedly recommend them to everyone!

V310,The Barn,Wow!! As soon as I visited The Barn I knew it was the perfect venue for our wedding and I was right! Our day was absolutely perfect and everything went so smoothly thanks to every one at The Barn! Everyone made you feel so comfortable and nothing was ever too much for them! They set up the venue exactly how I had visioned it and all the guests loved the food! We love going back now for a drink or food and they are always so welcoming still!
V310,The Barn,"Amy & I celebrated our marrage at the barn which couldn't have been better.

The staff were very friendly and extremely organised, going out of their way to make sure everything flowed effortlessly.

This put us both and our guests at ease to enjoy every moment."
V310,The Barn,"I cannot thank everyone at The Barn enough for making our wedding day the best day of our lives. It's hard to put into words how perfect everything was. From start to finish every detail was well thought out, every change of plan and sudden request was catered for and throughout you knew you were in safe hands. The venue is beautiful, staff are incredibly friendly, polite and helpful. Food and drink is amazing. The list goes on and on. All I can say again, is Thank You. Cannot recommend highly enough!"
V310,The Barn,"We recently had our wedding at The Barn and from the moment we contacted Philippe we couldn’t have asked for a better experience. With only 4 months between booking and event it was great that communication and planning with Janet was easy, flexible, timely and supportive – from our plans with various music playlists needed on different sound systems to arranging our rehearsal the day before, all the little details were accommodated.

The location of The Barn is really accessible being in the centre of town, with plenty of places for guests to stay nearby, yet it feels very private as it is set away from the main road down a private street with no passing traffic. It is a gorgeous venue, really intimate but with plenty of space for our 70 guests, and the team had done an excellent job of setting up and laying out our table decorations beautifully; it was a wonderful space for us to connect with our guests.

All the staff were professional, friendly and helpful throughout the event; many of our guests commented on how lovely they were, along with how fantastic the venue was.

The food was delicious, guests choose from 4 meals on each course, and every one of them looked amazing, we’ve heard many compliments of every option. Service throughout the meal was excellent, a good level of attentive, efficient and unobtrusive, they served a large room at a good pace.

The whole running of the day was done smoothly, changing areas worked really well, we hardly noticed the hard work going on downstairs while we had our meal.

We can’t thank the team at The Barn enough for helping us have such a wonderful day and we highly recommend this wonderful venue!"
V310,The Barn,"There’s no words to describe the barn or their team. If you haven’t already booked a wedding with them, do it, and don’t think twice!

Philippe and Janet are amazing, from our initial emails and queries, through to the booking and the meeting to discuss our options etc. We were presented with a lovely folder containing all of the information, and some sample menus - given plenty of choices to give to guests (allowed up to 4 of each for adults, and 2 of each for children - loads more flexibility than a lot of other venues)

We dropped off our decorations the day before, and it’s lovely to see local businesses working together to support each other and the area (they supply discount codes for local hotels), and the Hotel were happy for us to leave a car in the car park overnight before.

When I arrived at the venue, the team had decorated it just how we wanted it, with all of our name places out, activity packs, favours etc.

Nothing was too much trouble, we had vegetarians, coeliacs and allergies - all the food was impeccable. Every single person commented on how great their sea bass was, or how tender (and huge!) the rack of lamb was, it’s safe to say they catered for everyone (gluten free ice cream, gluten free bread rolls etc). Even catered for a vegetarian child at short notice !

Their house DJ (Luke Swift) did a great job too, keeping the music flowing and people up on their feet - a real crowd pleaser.

The bar staff, were incredible - smiles all round, enjoying the day as much as we were - making it extra special.

The sweet cart, patisserie selection and cheese tower looked great too (even supplied gluten free crackers for that too)!

Philippe, Janet, Andrew, Jack & Toby (and the rest of the back of house team), thank you so much for making our day so memorable, every single one of our guests said how great they day was, and you’ve even secured a few new restaurant customers (from as far as Greenwich) who are coming back as they want to taste the other food options 😂!!"
V310,The Barn,"We had our wedding here in November & ourselves & all of our guests had the best day. The staff were nothing short of amazing, so attentive & really couldn’t do enough for you. The food was brilliant, everyone said how they enjoyed every course & the evening buffet too! You got to choose out of a big list per course, so you could give your guests 4 options per course to choose from which is very very rare with wedding breakfasts! It really is such a beautiful & intimate venue with exceptional prices. They decorated it perfectly, exactly how we imagined. We dropped 5+ boxes off the night before & a description of how we’d like everything & the staff did it perfectly. Not one thing was wrong. We had outside suppliers for a couple of decor/sweet Cart items who failed to turn up, I found out as I was about to walk down the aisle so was upset and stressed. The Barn staff, especially Phillippe, sorted everything and to my surprise in the evening we had a stocked sweet table decorated downstairs for us & our guests, they really do go above & beyond for you. We have no complaints or reservations at all about this venue & would 100% recommend it to everyone. The ceremony room looked so pretty too, with the chairs covered & the pretty twig trees, we didn’t need any more decor in there than that, the orangery is such a pretty room on its own. As is the rest of the venue with gorgeous wooden beams, it can suit all sorts of wedding themes. Thank you to everyone at The Barn for making our special day, the best day ever!"
V310,The Barn,"Patrick and I had our wedding reception at the Barn on the 31st July 2022 and we could not have chosen a more perfect venue for our special day.
On viewing The Barn, we both instantly fell in love with this beautiful venue which is also in such a perfect location in the centre of Tunbridge Wells, so convenient for our guests, many of who would be staying in nearby hotels. Having a smaller wedding, we were also thrilled that we could have the exclusive use of the venue for the whole day which later proved to add to the relaxing atmosphere of the occasion.
Philippe was so friendly and helpful in guiding us with our choices which made everything so much easier and ensured all ran smoothly on the day.
Throughout the process, Janet was amazing too and always answered my questions promptly, nothing was too much trouble.
Like many couples who get married here, we had our photos taken in Calverley park, which is just across the road from the venue, again so convenient as we did not have to leave our guests for too long.
The food was delicious, and we had many compliments, it was also wonderful to be able to offer our guests individual menus from the various choices available, a feature I would not have previously thought was possible. The welcome canapes and the evening buffet were also very well received.
Luke Swift, the resident DJ, was great too and kept the dancers on their feet.
We are so pleased that we chose The Barn for our wedding and can not recommend this venue highly enough. We thoroughly enjoyed the day and all our guests had a fabulous time.
Dear Janet and Philippe, we so appreciate everything you did to make our day so special and one that we will always remember.
Thank you so much,
Christine & Patrick x"
V311,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","The best choice we made was having our wedding at the oak barn frame farm! Not only is the space gorgeous, but it's eco friendly, has lots of different options depending on preference and weather, and they have beautiful cottages for family and close friends to stay close and the option to spend the whole weekend at the farm! It was exactly what we were looking for! And the best part was the support! Chrystelle was amazing!! She helped us through the whole planning process and gave us the invaluable list of suppliers( who were all amazing!). She is such a professional and a wonderful person! She really went above and beyond making sure we had the best day (weekend) of our lives! Couldn't recommend this place more! If you're looking for a country wedding, you've found your place!"
V311,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","We had our wedding in October 2024 at the Oak Barn Frame Farm and we couldn’t have picked a more perfect venue! From the moment we looked around the barn, we both knew it was the place for us. Having 3 barns meant we were able to keep our 50 guests entertained and still have beautiful spaces. We weren’t sure what to expect with dry-hire, but the barn is so beautiful it could be kept minimal if you’re on a budget, but being able to personalise it to how we wanted it made it extra special for us. The open fields, waterfall and sheep meant we got some amazing photos (from our photographer Matt Birchall) as well as the best memories. Chrystelle couldn’t have been more helpful, from her communication in planning, to the materials provided in the run up to the wedding, and her excellent organisation on the day meaning our wedding ran seamlessly and we didn’t have to worry about anything. The list of trusted suppliers was great too, and we used quite a few who were also great. The accommodation on site was an added bonus for us and family, and all of our friends and family commented on what a perfect venue we’d chosen. Being environmentally focused was also a huge bonus for us, as it really aligned with our values. Thank you to all at the Oak Barn for giving us the happiest day!"
V311,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","It was an absolute joy to have our wedding at the oak barn - we had the most perfect day! The team were so responsive and helpful throughout the process - we loved working with Hayley and Chrystelle!

The spaces were all beautiful and a perfect balance of indoor and outdoor in case of rain! We had so many compliments on the venue throughout the day.

We loved how much we were able to personalise the venue - from setting up the wedding breakfast decorations from scratch to bottling up our own homemade cocktails to serve throughout the day. The onsite accommodation was spotless and felt so luxurious. It was fab for all our nearest and dearest to be so close and turned it from a day to a weekend of celebrations! Thank you so much to the oak barn for making it all so special!"
V311,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","We recently had our wedding at The Oak Barn and it was the perfect place. The barn and surroundings are absolutely beautiful, the fact you can spend the whole weekend there really makes the wedding feel special with plenty of time to set up and relax.
The team are amazing, really supportive in the run up and during the weekend and ready to help with whatever might arise!
Thank you for the best weekend ever."
V311,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","I cannot thank Oak Barn enough - you made everything absolutely PERFECT!!!

Thank you for your constant eye to detail, for keeping us in line and for your creative flare.

You managed expertly to make us all so relaxed on every level. Throughout this entire process you have been so diligent, always going the extra mile and always suggesting the most fun ideas - you really made all my dreams come true.

With our greatest thanks,
Chris and Alice"
V311,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","I honestly cannot stress enough how beautiful this venue is and how amazing the staff are. From the day we went to view the venue (and fell in love the second we drive down the drive) to the moment we left the day after our wedding the staff were always on hand for anything we needed. It’s great having the cottages on site as well, being able to stay the night before our wedding and the night of made life so much easier for us meaning we could get everything done the day before the wedding and I didn’t spend the morning stressing if everything was right. This venue is truly stunning and has so many different places for gorgeous photos. Thank you again Tim and Deana for allowing us to get married at your amazing venue. Emma and Elliot"
V311,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","It was great being able to stay from Friday till Sunday which made us all feel way more relaxed than trying to do everything in a day!
The three barns are wonderful each with its own unique charm and thing to offer.
The cottages were beautifully set out and offered us and our wedding party top end accommodation."
V311,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","From the first visit of the Oak Barn, I knew it was where I wanted to get married and it did not disappoint!
The booking process and the final details meeting run so smoothly, all of the staff are extremely helpful throughout they provide you with so much information to make your organising of the wedding so easy!
We booked Oak Barn for two nights along with Weavers Cottages, it was the best thing we did… our guests were able to settle in the day before and we had everyone round for drinks and nibbles the night before making our wedding so much fun! The cottages are so comfortable with every detail thought of… waking up to the sheep in the fields is just perfect!
Chrystelle was the best, she made sure we was happy at all times and made sure everything run so smoothly even appearing during my sons tantrum (toddler) in the middle of the ceremony with cookies to calm him down. After being awake in the middle of the night replanning our ceremony to be outside due to the fact I had both of my brothers giving me away and also how lucky we were with the fantastic weather!
Both members of staff who were there on the evenings to lock up the barns were so helpful and friendly and made it so easy for us!
The Oak Barn really is the most special venue, it is absolutely stunning down to every little touch! The memories we will have from the perfect wedding here will last forever for both us and our guests! Thank you to everyone at Oak Barn for making it so special!"
V311,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","From the moment we drove down the drive for the first time, until approximately six months later when we said I do, we knew this was the venue for us. We were blessed to have unexpectedly beautiful weather for April, the presence of the young lambs adding to the atmosphere and just the perfect day from start to finish.
We hired the venue for the weekend, to enable our wider family and guests to be part of our celebration and it really did take a huge amount of stress out of the actual day. The cottages are welcoming, of a high standard, and provide all that you need, although never did get to experience the copper bath!
The whole team are hugely supportive, encouraging, making you believe that anything is possible. Each wedding feels individual and personal, limited only by your imagination. We would whole heartedly recommend the Oak Barn and its recommended suppliers."
V311,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","We made the ultimate mistake of visiting this venue first when starting to plan our big day - no where else compared.

The views (& sheep!), the beautiful barn & Byre (a choice of indoor or outdoor ceremonies), well furnished cottages for all to stay & just a the perfect feel for a wedding.

They provided a list of recommended suppliers who have worked (& are trusted) at their venue which gave us a great starting point although they were more than accommodating for anyone new.

Very helpful in the run up in the day with compiling a complete run through of the day - with floor layouts, supplier details (& got in contact with each supplier on our behalf to ensure they were equipped with all the info for the day). Even on the day, Tim was great at resolving any small hiccups that appeared.

Huge thank you to Tim, Deana, Chrystelle, Tembo & all the behind the scenes team for making our day so special."

V313,The Vines of Rochester,"We had the most amazing wedding at The Vines! I would 100% recommend this wedding venue. The food, service, running of the day etc was all exceptional. All of our guests commented on how amazing the venue was"
V313,The Vines of Rochester,"We had the most amazing wedding day at The Vines of Rochester. The venue is absolutely beautiful, with so many gorgeous touches throughout.
The staff on the day and the build up were so helpful and accommodating, which meant the day ran so smoothly from start to finish.
We would definitely recommend anyone looking at The Vines as a potential wedding venue - we couldn't have wished for anything more!"
V313,The Vines of Rochester,"Our special day was perfect, and this is credit to the wonderful Vines venue and the amazing team led by Becky and Holly.

The venue is beautiful. So much character and style. We loved getting married in the tippe, very intimate. The dining room did not need a lot of dressing and flowers, some simple styling and the space looked amazing. We loved that there were multiple spaces for our guests to use, the bar area was lively and great for chatting while the dining rooms transformed to a generous dance floor. Then our closest friends and family were able to stay at the venue with us, to enjoy a yummy breakfast the next day.
The location, venue and setting is just perfect.

The whole experience with the Vines team was very professional and well organised. Questions were answered super promptly, with confidence from the super friendly team.
The supper tasting night was great, we were able to sample multiple starters and desserts, although keep an eye out and book early.
The pre wedding appointment went through every detail. There was nothing that they hadn’t considered and care was taken to tailor to our preferences, nothing was a problem.

On the day Becky and Holly were amazing, so attentive, supportive, brilliant ladies, they absolutely made the day with lots of complements from our guests on the high quality of the team. The food was outstanding, thank you to the culinary team.
The DJ was great, tailored to our music preferences and refused any off piste guest requests! Well looked after by the evening team.

We can’t thank you all enough for such a wonderful day."
V313,The Vines of Rochester,"From the initial visit to The Vines, we knew it was the perfect venue for us. The staff team were always on hand to help with any queries or logistical issues we had, answering all of our questions and the online portal was so easy to use. The pricing is clearly laid out and there aren't any hidden or added on costs later on. We mainly dealt with Holly on the lead up to the wedding, and Becky and Will on the day. They were all so helpful and supportive. They took care of a last minute crisis when the lady bringing our dog to be the ring bearer ended up stuck in traffic. Without us even knowing, they sent someone to go and help bring them to the venue on time. Nothing was too much trouble for them. The drinks...good luck deciding what package you want as they are all so delicious. We opted for the festival wedding which was so laid back, but still organised. The food was so good and the evening buffet was lovely. The DJ included liaised with us on the lead up to the wedding and worked with us to put together an idea of what we wanted and what would get people dancing, which worked perfectly. The rooms....there are so many to choose from to be your wedding suite. We opted for a garden room. We gave the others to guests travelling to the wedding and all of the rooms are so beautiful in their own unique way. Becky and Will were on hand all of our wedding day for us and our guests and anything we needed was taken care of without a fuss. The morning after we all had breakfast with our guests that stayed over and that was such a lovely extra touch to add to the wedding. Even the timings that the planners work out mean there are non rushed transitions of moving your items out and the next wedding bringing items in; you barely notice. Being able to store items there a few days before is a huge help! Also in the lead up to the wedding they invited us to a supper evening where we got to enjoy some of the lovely food on offer. In the portal there is also a section for selling and buying wedding items which is very helpful and convenient.
Honestly we couldnt have been happier with our choice of venue and have recommended it to friends that have since gotten engaged. Amazing venue and team x"
V313,The Vines of Rochester,"We instantly fell in love with The Vines, it was the perfect venue for us and we loved having a relaxed festival style wedding meaning we had more time to mingle with our guests. The wedding coordinators were friendly, accommodating and professional. We were in such good hands and were made to feel so special. It really was the best day. Thank you so much, Alex & Tom."
V313,The Vines of Rochester,"We were lucky enough to have held our wedding day at The Vines on 4th November 2023. From start to finish, the whole process was such a breeze. Their communication was always so speedy and thorough (which is what any bride wants). There were never too many small or big questions I could ask them, as they were always so happy to help. It was honestly such a stress free experience for us and they went above and beyond. I cannot thank them enough for everything. The venue, the rooms, the food, the staff… all faultless! We chose the ‘festival’ style wedding to suit us and our guests and we still have guests commenting now on what a fabulous day and experience it was. It was very different from any wedding we had attended, in the best way possible. If my husband would let me do it all again tomorrow, I would!"
V313,The Vines of Rochester,"We had a wonderful day with our friends and family. The venue is beautiful. Such amazing photo opportunities at the venue but also in Rochester with the castle and cathedral. everyone said how lovely it is. All the wedding co-ordinaters were wonderful, any problem or question was always dealt with promptly and professionally. Our venue will always have brilliant memories of our day."
V313,The Vines of Rochester,"We had our wedding here recently and wow what a venue! It’s such a pretty venue and so many of our guests commented on how lovely it is. It has amazing locations for photos, in the sunshine and rain! And we had a mixture of both on our day. But the best thing about the Vines has to be the team that work there. They couldn’t do enough for you. They made everything seem effortless, they were so kind and accommodating and we are so pleased we chose the Vines as our wedding venue. From Becky our duty manager on the day - who was absolutely fabulous and couldn’t have done more for us - to the bar staff, waiting staff, DJ and just everyone we encountered - they were all fabulous. Thank you so much!"
V313,The Vines of Rochester,"Venue is absolutely stunning.
Staff on the day were good & couldn’t do more.
Was sold on the basis we’d have a wedding portal to help us throughout - this is only for a traditional wedding. If having a festival wedding there is nothing.
Personally I felt alone & wasn’t confident until the meeting 8weeks before to go through plans for the day- I felt if anything was not ok it was late to make amendments.
As a second wedding I knew what I wanted but was chilled, however for some this may not be a good experience.

On the day - we had pre arranged a tab with conditions, thus didn’t seem to be adhered too. I had several decorations go missing & I got no response.

We received no contact after the wedding to ask for feedback or to ask if everything was ok"
V314,Solton Manor,"Solton Manor had everything that we dreamed of for our special day. The grounds are just beautiful, the Manor House is full of character and charm and the Dutch Barn definitely has the wow factor.
The team at Solton Manor deserve a special mention. From start to finish, Karen, Jackie and the team were professional, friendly, helpful, extremely hard working and nothing was ever too much trouble. They welcomed our sausage dog, Frankie who was a very important part of our day. A big 'woof' of thanks from him!!
Our guests loved staying in the Manor House and the pretty Dovecote Cottage. The facilities allowed us to make breakfast for our guests the day after which was an added bonus! The games room with a table tennis table was a real hit too!
Highly recommend this fantastic venue!"
V314,Solton Manor,"Our wedding was everything we wanted.
Karen and Jackie were there to help and had lots of ideas to make our dream come true.
We stayed in the Manor House and the Bridal Suite is stunning. The boys used the Games Room to get ready and the girls had the whole Dovecote to themselves.
Food was delicious too!
It was wonderful, thank you so much.
Lena and Christian"
V314,Solton Manor,"Solton Manor was the perfect setting for our special day in October 2023.
Karen and Jackie made us feel at ease and were super responsive with all the planning right from our very first contact.
The day itself was everything that we wanted it to be and would absolutely recommend this venue. Thank you, Abi and Josh"
V314,Solton Manor,"From the moment we arrived at Solton Manor, we knew it was the venue for us. We were met at the door of the historic Manor House and had a fabulous time hearing stories about the house, walking around the gorgeous gardens and visiting the wonderful Dutch Barn - we were already wedding planning!
Our Wedding was such a special weekend and we loved every minute of it.
The venue is magical and you have thought of everything to make it perfect.
Your attention to detail was incredible and your help was so supportive every step of the way.
It was as important to you as it was to us that the day was the day of our dreams and we just cannot believe how perfect it was. Thank you so much for everything. Mandy and Kevin"
V314,Solton Manor,From the booking o the planning to the actual wedding was all so amazing! The team truly went out of their way to make my day the most perfect day ever!
V314,Solton Manor,"From start to finish, the venue were brilliant. Always prompt to respond, ready with help and ideas, flexible and just perfect on our Special Day. What amazing memories we made that day"
V314,Solton Manor,Shelley is so kind and helpful! The venue is stunning and I loved every minute of our wedding day there!
V314,Solton Manor,"We had our wedding in Oct2021 & Solton Manor was the perfect setting for our special day. Shelly handled the whole process from start to finish in such a friendly, helpful & efficient manner. Our wedding was postponed by 1 year due to COVID but Shelly made the whole process stress-free and she was always super responsive. We would thoroughly recommend this wedding venue!"
V315,The Darenth,"Our wedding experience was absolutely perfect! Everything was so well organised, and the staff went above and beyond to accommodate us. Communication throughout the entire process was excellent, making the day completely stress-free. Highly recommended!"
V315,The Darenth,"I cannot recommend the Darenth more. The staff were absolutely incredible, we could not have wanted for more on our day. We were never without a drink, and nothing was too much of an ask. The staff were so friendly to our guests, and really created a relaxed environment. Leading up to the ceremony they made us feel so relaxed and they were very informative. Jason, Kerry, Sarah, Louise and everyone at the Darenth, thank you so much for making our day so special!"
V315,The Darenth,"We found The Darenth when looking for a venue for our twilight wedding. We wanted our wedding to truly reflect us as a couple and where we could be flexible with how the day would go.

When we went to see The Darenth, not only was the venue stunningly beautiful, inside and out, there was a warmth to the place and the team were so friendly and very helpful. From the moment we contacted the team, Lucy was our main contact and couldn’t help us enough. Despite the number of weddings held here, we felt special throughout as if our special day was the main focus for them all. Lucy was great with all the details, understanding what we wanted and offering help and support without pushing anything.

On the day, Jason was amazing at managing the day - making sure we had time to ourselves but that the day ran exactly as we wanted. He was also very supportive and did a great job putting us at ease when we were nervous leading up to the ceremony. The whole team were thoughtful and looked after us all day, making sure we had food and drink and anything else we needed. All our guests commented on how wonderful the staff were and it allowed us to truly focus on enjoying our day. Leigh and Kerry were also fantastic on the day, couldn’t be more helpful.

We had an amazing day, everything went exactly as we hoped and better. A massive part of that was down to The Darenth and their incredible team - we couldn’t recommend highly enough!"
V315,The Darenth,"From the moment you walk into The Darenth we were made to feel comfortable. We were taken on a tour of the venue and booked there and then In October 2022 for September 2023. The staff were knowledgable and professional which is what made us book this venue.

Communication was always good throughout, we visited several times with different family members and the staff were alway welcoming. As an older couple we wanted that relaxed but professional day and this is what we got.

The venue is amazedly clean and beautiful with views of the golf course. We was lucky even to get married outside and the outside area is amazing but the staff make this place and your day the best it could be.

We dealt with Kerrie and Jason mainly but everyone we had dealings with were great. Jason ran the day and he was brilliant, I love a bit of banter and he was excellent and even made it fun when I was so nervous 😊 there was also a lady that run the evening (sorry I can’t remember her name) she was also really good making sure everything was ok and stayed until the last guest left. One thing they did do was made sure the bride and groom kept topped up with drinks all day and night again a nice touch, I didn’t visit the bar once 😀

The food was amazing and everyone commenting on how good the food was. We had 9 children and they even did a 3 course for them with milk or lemonade for the toast which was a lovely little touch and made the children part of the day.

The only thing I would have liked would be to have a dressing room on site for the wedding day rather than travelling from elsewhere but that’s my personal view.

Thank you to everyone involved in our day ❤️"
V315,The Darenth,"We got married at this beautiful venue 11.08.23 and cannot recommend enough!! Everyone commented saying how perfect the day was, and every detail was covered by the amazing staff!! Nothing is ever too much to ask - we want to do it all over again!! Massive thanks especially to Jason, Kirsty & Kerry!! My go to people on the day and leading up to the wedding! But every member of staff were just amazing and on the ball with everything. Thank you from a very happy couple 🤍"
V315,The Darenth,I couldn’t recommend this venue enough. From the day we walked into the darenth to view this venue we have always felt so welcomed and wanted. They couldn’t do anymore to help us as they went above and beyond. The venue is absolutely stunning from the outside to the inside 💕 myself and my husband would like the thank each and everyone of the staff here at the darenth no words can explain how much you made our dream become a reality 💕 we shall be booking to come back for our yearly anniversary. Highly recommend this venue*5
V315,The Darenth,"My Wife & I would firstly like to thank Jason for his professionalism, humour, and his skill in dealing with things in real time which put both of us at ease as well as all of our guests.

The catering staff on the day were magnificent and very caring towards us all.

Another plus was the generous of food which all guests appreciated, from the Canopes, Wedding Breakfast & Evening Buffet.

The only issue we did have is that it was agreed that we would have Jallof Rice with the Curry Goat & Fried Fish, but ending up having Rice & Peas with the Curry Goat.

The Jallof Rice being an African dish & Curry Goat being Carribean would have been excellent as we had them at our planning meeting 5 weeks before the Wedding.

The big disappointment was the performance of the in house DJ (Chelmer Discos).

The fact that we could not select our own DJ made us nervous about the music, hence we kept confirming whether the DJ had experience of performing for a mainly Afro Caribbean crowd.

We were advised that this was not an issue, and it turns out according to DJ that he lacks expertise with Afro Beats, Soco & Reggae.

We also asked for the love sign to be displayed as a backdrop in the Ballroom before the Wedding Ceremony commenced which was agreed upon by Chelmer Discos, however it arrived after 19.00.

When we tried to ascertain why the love sign was not delivered at the time agreed, and also, why the music was not mixed as appose to just playing tracks that we emailed to him.

In response we received a rude & threatening email from the in house DJ - Jimmy.

We both loved having our Wedding at The Darenth and all our guests have all commented on how brilliant it was & they loved Jason.

Regards. Mr & Mrs Hutton-Young"
V315,The Darenth,"We celebrated our wedding day at the darenth on Thursday 25th may.
I can not fault our experience at all. From start to finish Jason/Kerry & the team made our day perfect."
V315,The Darenth,Just had my wedding at The Darenth and what an amazing experience it was from start to finish. The staff are all fantastic they made me feel very special on my day. They kept us informed throughout the day with everything that was happening and are all so good at their jobs. The food was amazing and got so many compliments from our guests as did the stunning venue. Special shout out to Jason who was our rock during the day.
V315,The Darenth,"Fabulous venue, immaculately decorated. Kerry, Jason and the team were so kind and professional. I have worked at most venues being a wedding florist, but The Darenth was my choice. We had a beautiful day and they treated my guests like family. I will be recommending them to all my brides"
V316,The Spa Hotel,"We are absolutely overjoyed with how our religious wedding ceremony (Nikah) at the Spa Hotel turned out- truly, it felt like a dream come true. From the moment we began planning, the entire experience exceeded our expectations. Despite the tight timeline of just under four months, Emily Phipps, who I believe is any extremely talented Events and Wedding Coordinator worked tirelessly to bring our vision to life. I had so many ideas, most quite unconventional, but Emily welcomed them with open arms and went above and beyond to make it all happen.

Emily brought so much warmth, dedication, and joy to the table, and thanks to her, our religious ceremony was nothing short of magical. It’s rare to find genuine and skilful individuals in the wedding industry who can truly capture the essence of your dreams and make them a reality, but Emily did just that! We could not have asked for a more perfect day and now four months on, we find ourselves reminiscing over how perfect it was.

To Emily, Tina and Mate, we feel that you have become an extension of our own family! You were not only professional but genuinely caring, your hard work and attention to detail ensured that every moment on the day was flawless. We are so grateful for your contribution to making our wedding feel like a scene from a fairy tale. You are all an asset to The Spa Hotel Events Team!!

For anyone looking to host their special day at the Spa Hotel, we wholeheartedly recommend it. The staff are beyond talented and will treat your celebration with the utmost care and respect. They made our day unforgettable, and we will always be grateful to them for giving us memories that we will cherish forever.

Thank you, Spa Hotel, for making our dreams come true. You will always be a part of our hearts and wedding story."
V316,The Spa Hotel,"When our initial venue unexpectedly closed, we were feeling disheartened; however, we viewed The Spa Hotel and immediately fell in love with its natural beauty, especially its gorgeous Spa Temple. Our coordinator, Emily, was a star and helped us to plan our day to perfection. She was always on hand to answer any queries we had, and she also helped to set up on the day which was very kind of her! We ideally wanted an outdoor ceremony and the weather really came through for us, so we were able to marry surrounded by flowers! The day was an incredible experience from start to finish. David was our wedding coordinator on the day and he went above and beyond to ensure that everything ran smoothly. The team made the process fun and my partner and I were able to enjoy the wedding without any stress or anxiety. Thank you, The Spa Hotel team, for making our day so special."
V316,The Spa Hotel,"We couldn't be happier with our decision to celebrate our marriage at The Spa Hotel.

From beginning to end the service and attention has been incredible. From the moment I arrived to set up our decorations to breakfast in bed and clearing down the room.

We were made to feel special and so were our guests, anything that we needed was delivered.

The suites are beautiful as are the grounds, we felt so lucky to have them as a backdrop to our day.

Our meal was 5*, incredible, we received so many compliments, and food was a big part of the day for us. Delicious!

Thank you, to everyone."
V316,The Spa Hotel,"My husband and I got married and celebrated our wedding reception at the Spa Hotel in December 2023. The day was a dream from start to finish and the team at the Spa did absolutely everything to give us an unforgettable day. Tasha, our wedding coordinated, worked with us from the moment we started planning with the Spa and was available via email and phone regularly to help us work out the details of the day & evening. The setting is beautiful at the Spa, especially at Christmas with all the trees, lights, and decorations. The food was fantastic, everyone commented on how tasty the wedding breakfast & canapes were. The team were so responsive & helpful with the fact that I do not drink, so had all my alternatives to hand all throughout the day. What a perfect place to get married and celebrate our wedding, thank you so much to Tasha and all the team at the Spa Hotel!"
V316,The Spa Hotel,"Beautiful venue, amazing food, the best personable service from the first meeting to the last drink on the day! Thank you so much to Emily and David at the Spa hotel"
V316,The Spa Hotel,"Thank you so much! We had such a great day. For us the best day of our lives so far!

I could not fault the hospitality of you and your staff. If something wasn’t there you guys were straight on it. Nothing was too much to ask. Maty really put our minds at ease. Making sure I didn’t fall down the stairs and having water ready for us when he knew we’d be shaking before starting the ceremony!

It was like a well oiled machine and we didn’t have to lift a finger which took all stress away completely.

A lovely touch was adding the petals in the room and tidying up before we came upstairs. Made us relax so well.

Everyone was so helpful. I’d also like to mention how helpful one of your staff was. I’m not sure of his name, he had red hair. He could see I was panicking in the morning and reassured me by telling me everything was being set up for the ceremony. He was very accommodating and I’m sure he’ll go far in your industry!

Also thank you to Emily. Everything went so well and that’s all down to her coordination. Every staff member knew what needed to be done.

Again thank you so so much!! I’m sure we’ll be back again and of course we will be recommending you guys to everyone we know!!"
V316,The Spa Hotel,"We cannot thank the spa hotel enough, they were so incredible and the whole process made us at ease throughout. Our guests were so impressed at the quality of service, food and drink. We even had guests with sensitive allergies at our day and they had no issues. Everything went perfectly thanks to all the staff.
I couldn’t recommend them more to anyone. So thank you the spa hotel for making our dream wedding."
V316,The Spa Hotel,"We are so happy that we chose to have our wedding day at the Spa Hotel! Right from the beginning, you were so fantastic - fielding questions, keeping us on schedule with jobs and always being a very lovely friendly face to speak to whenever we needed. We so, so appreciate you.

The wedding venue was so beautiful - the photographs have come out so well! The backdrop is absolutely stunning. I’ve just forwarded you our wedding video tease and I’ll send some photos separately. Please feel free to use on any social media.

Your team on the day were great too, so lovely and kind to us."
V316,The Spa Hotel,We got married earlier this summer at The Spa Hotel and it was fabulous. Everybody there is so professional and are experts at what they do. Everybody was so accommodating and helped make our day so incredibly special. The organisation from everybody was amazing (in particular Natasha) and we had the best day. The day went without a hitch and was everything we dreamed of and more. Our guests had a great time and the food was incredible. I can't recommend The Spa Hotel as a wedding venue more!
V316,The Spa Hotel,"After months of planning, discussions and decisions we were finally married at The Spa Hotel, Royal Tunbridge Wells on Saturday.

Thank you to Tasha, David, Jake and the whole team for helping us on the way and delivering a perfect day (despite the weather) with superb and attentive service as well as everything we requested meeting and exceeding our expectations."
V317,Winters Barns,"This was the first venue we visited in person and knew from the moment we walked in the door, walked through the grounds and spoke with the team (Sophie) - this is where we want to get married.

The pre planning process, the correspondence, the queries, the multiple visits - nothing was too much trouble and everything was addressed promptly and in a detailed manner (if it was easier to explain something over the phone rather than email, thats exactly what they would do).

The venue was perfect for guests to explore and roam (& children) but can be contained in a safe surrounding.

On the day, I think it was summed up perfectly by our videographer ""the team are fantastic here, and if anything does go wrong on the day you wont even notice - they are so professional"". We can contest to this - it was perfect!

Thank you Sophie and the Team
x"
V317,Winters Barns,"This venue gives 10/10 for everything. We had looked at four venues before this one. As soon as we walked in we knew it was exactly what we wanted for our winter wedding and the need for onsite accommodation. The service was second to none, we didn’t have to lift a finger on the day and didn’t need to check anything or worry about anything. The caterers were five star, the service was exceptional, all of our guests remarked on the extremely professional service and amazing food. I would give it all 10 out of 10. The band, The Redfords were also superb, in the evening. Sally looked after everything superbly. If you want a magical stress free day that runs like clockwork - book it!"
V317,Winters Barns,"Winters Barns was the perfect setting for our wedding.
We had the most amazing day and could not recommend it highly enough.
Lizzie was absolutely amazing and made the whole process so easy for us.
Everyone was there to help but they were not intrusive at all.
All our guests were blown away by the service and the food - everyone has made great memories.
We have some amazing photos from the grounds and it was so easy having everything all in one place - from getting ready to staying overnight.
Even the set up and taking down was done for us so we didn't have to think about anything - we could just enjoy it all.
I could not have wished for a better venue and they exceeded our expectations by far!"
V317,Winters Barns,"For a venue as busy as Winters Barns, they truly made us feel like the only people getting married, remembering the small details and providing invaluable advice throughout planning and coordination. Getting excited with us during the planning, liaising with our vendors and giving us helpful prompts as we got closer to the day. We never once struggled to get in contact with the venue or get a clear answer on our questions… and there was a few!
On our final meeting where we ran through all the little details, we were met with suggestions and solid guidance which left us feeling confident our dream day was going to come to life as we imagined.
Sally is a SUPERSTAR and our day was run to perfection thanks to her. She pays attention to detail and run us on time to the minute, but she also had lots of fun with it. Popping in to check on us all getting ready always with a big smile and some sound advice and a little time check! Sally put us both as ease as we knew if there was an issue she would resolve it.
Our day at the venue was perfect, from getting ready and building up to the ceremony, it was faultless. The call button in the getting ready spaces is brilliant, this saved the men who were all struggling with their pocket squares and needed super Sally to come and save them!
The accommodation was beautiful and the perfect way to extend the celebrations a bit longer with a recovery breakfast with our families the next morning.
We honestly had the perfect day, as did our guests and have received endless compliments on the venue; the service and everything in between. If we were to relive the day we would not change a single thing.
Thank you so much to the winters barns team and Sally, we couldn’t have done it without you!"
V317,Winters Barns,"Right from the first appointment we knew the venue was gorgeous and it was the one for us! Since booking the staff were always so helpful over emails for any queries whilst I was planning! On the big day we had Lizzie look after us, she is truly the best at what she does!!
I was so set on having an outdoor ceremony but due to weather it had to be inside, however I wasn’t disappointed! It was beautiful inside especially with the fresh new hops (September wedding). Everything went smoothly and we couldn’t have had a better day. We used all the accommodation on site too which was great, clean and comfortable!"
V317,Winters Barns,"Winters Barns is an incredible venue. It has a beautiful rustic charm, from the exposed beams in the bar, wedding breakfast and dance floor areas, to the dried hops hanging from the ceiling. The courtyard is stunning and was well used by our guests well into the evening. The pond with the bridge makes for beautiful pictures and was a huge selling point for us.
The staff were truly amazing. I cannot fault them. They’re incredibly warm and friendly and really do make you feel special. They never once gave the impression they do this every day, rather that yours is the most important day in the world!
We absolutely loved our day - it was truly unforgettable, largely thanks to the brilliant team at Winters Barns."
V317,Winters Barns,"A truly stunning venue! We cannot thank Winters Barns enough for making our day so incredibly special. The staff are so friendly, welcoming and professional, nothing is too much to ask of them and they ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible. We were able to fully enjoy our day knowing everything was being dealt with behind the scenes.
The venue and its grounds are beautiful, the perfect setting for some stunning wedding pictures! The facilities at this venue are amazing from the garden, the barn itself, the salon and pump room to get ready in the morning of the wedding. The accommodation is beautiful and so incredibly clean!
If you’re looking for a barn wedding, I cannot recommend Winters Barns enough! You will not be disappointed! Thank you once again!"
V317,Winters Barns,"We would to thank Sally and her team at Winters Barns for making our special day come to life. This venue is absolutely beautiful allowing for some stunning photos. All our guests commented on its cutsie barn vibes and well maintained grounds.
The food was exactly what we wanted with our 3 course meal and evening food, all delivered with amazing service.
We couldn’t praise or recommend this venue enough!
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
V317,Winters Barns,"Our wedding at Winters Barns was a dream come true. From the moment we arrived, we were captivated by the enchanting atmosphere and timeless charm. The stunning surroundings and well-maintained grounds created the perfect backdrop for our special day.

The staff at Winters Barns went above and beyond to ensure every detail was perfect. Their professionalism and warm hospitality made us feel truly special. From the seamless coordination to the meticulous attention to detail, the entire day ran smoothly, allowing us to relax and fully enjoy each moment.

The ceremony area, with its rustic elegance and intimate setting, created an unforgettable experience. The reception space was equally impressive, with charming decor and a spacious layout that comfortably accommodated our guests. The lighting and ambiance added a touch of romance, making the evening even more magical.

We can’t rate Winters Barns highly enough. It exceeded our expectations in every way, providing us with cherished memories that will last a lifetime. If you’re looking for a wedding venue that combines beauty, elegance, and exceptional service, Winters Barns is the perfect choice."

V318,Cooling Castle Barn,"Cooling Castle Barn really was our perfect wedding venue. We fell in love instantly and it was the only venue we looked at for our wedding and booked immediately before we even left! The price of the venue and what is included is incredible, it was worth every single penny and we’d highly recommend. Every single staff member we came into contact with couldn’t have helped enough! Out toastmaster (Steve) was absolutely amazing and co-ordinator on the day (Chelsea) was so so helpful with everything that we needed and made sure that everything was sorted and we didn’t have to think of a thing on the day! The getting ready rooms were perfect and the food was absolutely incredible!! We had so many comments about the food and the venue in general from our guests, everyone absolutely loved it!! Thank you so much, we had the most amazing wedding at the most perfect venue x"
V318,Cooling Castle Barn,"From start to finish, the staff were so friendly and professional! Everything was broken down and made so simple, the app was incredible to help keep track of planning. On the day Becky was honestly everything we could have asked for, she kept us updated on everything that was happening whilst we were getting ready and made everything run so smoothly. Would recommend this venue to anyone, we had so many compliments on our choice and had everything we needed under one roof! Topped off by returning to our room with champagne, cake and chocolates. We cannot say thank you enough!! Mr and Mrs Jeeves x"

V319,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We got married on 17 May 2024 and planned a weekend of celebrations with our family and friends, including a 'We tied the knot' cocktail party in the Brasserie on the 18 May 2024. The hotel has a number of quirky and interesting spaces perfect for adding a different feel to parts of your celebration as well as different photo opportunities. It has a trendy and luxurious feel with lots of unique and modern touches. OWP is also a stones throw away from the historic Pantiles which whilst not only beautiful also had a selection of bars, restaurants and boutique shops to entertain our guests during down time. Many of our guests commented it was like being in Europe and again the surrounding areas are perfect for photos.

Not only is the venue beautiful, but the staff and service are absolutely incredible and I do not say this lightly, the service was second to none and everyone was welcoming and friendly creating a true home away from home experience. Karen our Wedding Co-ordinator was amazing and flexible to our different needs. One of the things that attracted us to OWP was our wedding was treated as an individual celebration something we had not found at other venues which had a fairly set itinerary. The food was amazing with a large choice of options, we opted for a deluxe choice menu and it did not disappoint. It was also great value for money which enabled us to carry out our celebrations over a long weekend whilst also focusing on our entertainment and creating the atmosphere we wanted.

If you want a venue that is modern, trendy, flexible and different from the traditional country house wedding then I highly recommend. We have a weekend of memories at One Warwick Park with our nearest and dearest that we will treasure forever and can't wait to return for our anniversary's.

Thank you to the whole One Warwick Park team! Sarah & Sam"
V319,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We had the pleasure of having our wedding at the Warwick Park Hotel, it was an amazing experience for us as a couple and all our guests. Karen our Event coordinator was great with us, she was very receptive to our ideas and did all she can to make it possible even though our wedding was on short notice.

For the actual day, the whole team was excellent, nothing was too much for them.

They went above and beyond for all our guest, one thing that stood out for me was on the day of the wedding the Club room which was the standard complimentary room for the wedding night was used by my wife to get ready in the morning, to avoid us getting back to the same room and enhance our experience on our big day we were upgraded to the Deluxe Room with other complementaries which just made our day perfect. All our bags were moved for us we didn't even need to touch anything which was a really nice touch for us.

Can't say a thank you big enough to Karen and her excellent team, we were chose Warwick on recommendation and we can boldly say we were not disappointed.

And will definitely recommend Warwick Park Hotel to anyone looking for a top of the range service and venue.

Thank you."
V319,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We had an amazing wedding! The venue allowed us to be flexible with our requirements. We had so many lovely comments about the venue, hotel and food. Service and staff were amazing.
The day went to plan and was perfect in every way.
Our wedding meal was lovely. The function room looked beautiful.
Our room, junior suite was spacious and really enjoyed the 3 nights we was there.
Thank you to Karen and all the staff for making our day so special!!"

The food was lovely and everything was organised well. Thank you OWP."
V319,One Warwick Park Hotel,"One Warwick Park is utterly amazing for a wedding venue!

I cant thank Karen and every staff member at OWP for making our wedding day perfect.

Karen and I connected via emails and calls in the months leading up to the wedding, the communication was perfect. Everything I ever asked for or things we talked about nothing was never a problem, Karen and the OWP team were brilliant to work with.

The venue is so gorgeous, Modern and Elegant. The Room is bright and large with a gorgeous fire place and open brick wall with wooden beams.
The hotel rooms are so sophisticated and modern. We stayed in ‘The House’ and for Bridal party prep this was the perfect location!!! It was dreamy!!! Spacious, comfy beds, gorgeous kitchen and bathrooms. It was so special to stay with bridesmaids & Family members the night before, but each of us having our own bedroom in a house environment, the House is just amazing!

The food was fabulous!
The chef created some gorgeous dishes for 80 guests, many with dietary requirements, this was no trouble at all and each guests feedback about their meal was that it was all delicious! Thank you chef!!
Our evening buffet – the compliments we received were great here too!. Especially the chicken goujons!
The wedding tasting afternoon OWP hosted to sample wedding day food was amazing. We tried all the wines and dishes, it was so lovely to enjoy this day as a pre wedding day date day. Thank you so much!

I popped into the venue multiple times before the wedding day to visualize and ask various questions that I ever had. Any team member I ever met was so friendly, helpful and kind. Nothing was ever a problem for anyone.

Days before our wedding I sent Karen a photo of some cocktails I liked, Karen worked with the food and beverage manager to bring my idea into reality. I was so happy – thank you so much!

On the day of the wedding Karen you popped in and out, and were there to support me from 7am - I loved it so much the way you kept connected with us, thank you!
My emotions were high throughout the day and this didn’t phase you at all, your support was truly appreciated!

We could not be any more happier with the way our wedding day went. We had such amazing feedback from our guests on how gorgeous the venue and the hotel are. And How good the food was!

Thank you so much for everything Karen. You are great at what you do!!
Enjoy every moment of your own wedding very soon! We are sending you all our love!

Please pass our huge thanks to everyone who worked and helped us during our wedding.
It is so very much appreciated. xxxx"
V319,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We will never be able to thank Karen and the whole One Warwick Park team enough. We would highly recommend this beautiful venue to anyone planning their wedding and are truly grateful for the effort that went into ensuring our day was exactly what we wanted. The food was amazing and we had lots of compliments from the guests on how friendly and polite the bar staff were.
Thank you for helping to make us the happiest we’ve ever felt. We can’t wait to come back and stay for our first wedding anniversary."
V319,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We always knew we wanted a boutique venue to suit our modest budget and the moment we saw OWP we fell in love with its chic and simple interior, perfect for putting our own spin on our special day. Karen and the OWP team were fantastic throughout the wedding planning process. No request was too big/ difficult for Karen and she was so attentive to our wants and needs. We had the most magical Christmas wedding and cannot be happier with how it all turned out! Thank you Karen and team for making our special day perfect!"
V319,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We loved this wedding venue the first time we saw it. We wanted a Christmas wedding and the room with the beams, lights and Christmas tree looked amazing. Planning of the wedding was helped by Karen who gave fantastic recommendations. Nothing was too much trouble. We had the most amazing day. Big thank you."
V319,One Warwick Park Hotel,"Cannot thank Karen and the OWP staff enough for our magical day. From the moment we saw the venue we fell in love and everything was so simple and we wanted for nothing.

The venue has a modern class in an area of Old style beauty. The venue can comfortably hold either a large number or a smaller more intimate celebration and will still look magical."
V319,One Warwick Park Hotel,"Where do I even start….

When we first visited the hotel I knew it would make the perfect venue for our wedding. The function room was perfect, modern, perfect size, the bar was amazing. It just ticked all the boxes.

Karen was absolutely amazing, she was there every step of the way answering all my question and giving advice. She helped us organised our day and help us make an idea on paper turn into the most amazing day.

Before the wedding day we got to attend a wedding menu tasting session was great, every dish we tried was lovely and so happy with our choices everyone at the wedding said how amazing the food was.

On the day the help from all the staff was amazing from welcoming our guests and helping all our suppliers, made me feel so calm as the bride as I knew I didn’t have to worry about anything. From start to finish the wedding was perfect and it wouldn’t have happened without the help of Karen and everyone at the hotel - they turned around the rooms so quickly and the service from the bar staff was perfect.

I couldn’t recommend this venue enough they have everything you need and more for the perfect wedding."
V320,Chapel House Estate,"Chapel House Estate and the team were absolutely amazing! We knew from the first time we saw the venue that it was the one - every single location is beautiful and provides stunning photo opportunities. Every person that we spoke to was so helpful, especially Georgia who was our fabulous on-the-day co-ordinator! We did have a few issues with music during dinner but these were promptly rectified by the staff (with the help of the Head Chef's phone!). The food was absolutely fabulous and I think everyone who came to our wedding was absolutely blown away from start to finish. Thank you so much for making our day everything we dreamed it would be!"
V320,Chapel House Estate,"The most amazing, stunningly beautiful wedding venue, catered for our micro wedding with as much care an attention as a big wedding, Jade our wedding co-ordinator was amazing! The food in the no 9 restaurant was as out of this world! Highly recommend!"
V320,Chapel House Estate,"We cannot recommend Chapel House Estate enough. From the very beginning the team here were so helpful and accommodating.

We’ve been to weddings before that have felt a little disorganised and of course, things can happen out of anyone’s control, however, as soon as booked our wedding here we felt like we were in safe hands. Throughout the entire process, we felt so at ease, and that’s thanks for the team. Georgia and the team worked so hard for us and it really showed. The day ran so smoothly.

The grounds in the venue are truly stunning too and offered the perfect backdrop for our special day. We decided to get married in August as we really loved the orchard and gardens, and to top it off we spent the rest of the day in the beautiful courtyard. We have to mention the food too. We opted for the BBQ option and wow. It was so delicious and all our guests really loved it.

In summary, you won’t regret getting married here. The venue is stunning, the team are fantastic and the food is to die for. Thank you so much Chapel House Estate."
V320,Chapel House Estate,"We had our wedding here in the court yard this last Sunday and all I can say is wow - they exceeded our expectations and more .

Every detail was perfect.
The venue is truly breathtaking and all our guests were blown away by how magical it looked.
The food was exquisite which all our guests have continued to talk about.

V320,Chapel House Estate,"We got married at Chapel House Estate in August 2023.

From being shown around the venue by the owner a year earlier, we knew it would be perfect, and indeed, it was!

The grounds are beautifully maintained.

The Chapel House has been finished to an exquisite standard, and the other accommodation on site is great and was loved by our guests.

The whole site was impeccably maintained and as clean as a whistle.

There is ample parking.

The Team went out of their way to accommodate us, with a bespoke menu and served individual alternatives for those with non standard dietary requirements (vegan, veggie and various intolerances!).

The food was of an exceptional standard for over 100 guests and the service was both charming and faultless. It was apparent to us both that the entire team were committed to making our wedding day a resounding success!

In short we were completely blown away by the venue when we first saw it and it overdelivered! What a superb venue!

Special shouts out to Jade, Georgia and the chefs! You are now part of our story!

Would we recommend it?

YES, WE WOULD!"
V320,Chapel House Estate,"If you're dreaming of a wedding that transports you to a faraway destination without leaving the shores of Kent, look no further than Chapel House Estate. This hidden gem is a testament to luxury, elegance, and the promise of an unforgettable wedding experience.

From the moment I stepped onto the grounds, I was whisked away to a Mediterranean haven. The outdoor waiting reception area exuded charm and sophistication, adorned with lush greenery, fragrant blooms, and tasteful decor. The soft rustling of leaves and the gentle breeze lent an air of serenity, setting the perfect tone for the day.

The outdoor wedding setup was nothing short of magical. With sweeping views that seemed to stretch endlessly, it felt as if I was watching the exchanging vows in a private paradise. The attention to detail in the decorations was impeccable, and the natural beauty of the surroundings only enhanced the atmosphere of romance and celebration.

The resort's reception area was a true showstopper. Elegant and opulent, it provided a stunning backdrop for speeches and the main course. The seamless blend of indoor and outdoor spaces allowed us to enjoy the best of both worlds. The expansive glass windows offered uninterrupted views of the picturesque surroundings, while the tasteful interior design added an element of grandeur to the celebration.

The culinary experience was nothing short of extraordinary. The menu showcased a fusion of flavours that left myself raving for more. From delectable appetisers to the exquisite main courses, every dish was a work of art washed down with the very best drop of Rosé. The culinary team's attention to detail and dedication to creating a memorable dining experience was evident in every bite.

The staff at Chapel House Estate were outstanding with a special shout out to Katie for really going above and beyond. Their professionalism, warmth, and attentiveness ensured that every aspect of our special day ran seamlessly. They anticipated my needs before I even realised them, and their genuine smiles and willingness to go above and beyond left a lasting impression on myself and it seemed all guests. A huge kudos to Darren & the force on such an incredible team dynamic.

V320,Chapel House Estate,"This venue is first class. All our guests said it was one of the best wedding venues that they have been to. Our day surpassed all of our expectations. The staff made sure the day was seamless. Food was great, service was amazing and the venue is stunning. Would highly recommend to anyone in a heartbeat. Special thank you to Jade and Georgia for ensuring the day was so special. X"
V320,Chapel House Estate,"A few weeks ago my partner and I had the complete pleasure of attending our dear friends’ wedding at Chapel House Estate.
Of course it was lovely to attend and be part of their day. We had heard good things about the venue, but we were taken back with its fabulousness.
Close by to our home in Broadstairs, we felt we had arrived at a far away country estate far further away than we have travelled.
This set the perfect stage for the quintessential and stylish day of celebrations, which continued with partying and fun into the late evening.
The day was faultless.

Having worked in the wedding and events sector both in the UK and the Middle East, I have been lucky to have experienced many events, both as guest and a professional.
The wedding at CHE was up there with the best, from the F&B to the furnishings and staff.
In fact so good it even made me consider getting married again!"
V321,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"The team at Port Lympne were absolutely phenomenal. Months of planning and working with us to ensure our big day would go off without any issues, and it led to a really stress-free day for the both of us, allowing us to fully enjoy our wedding day.

There are far too many things to mention, it’s simply impossible to fully cover the scope of everything they have done for us as part of our wedding.

Guests were raving about pretty much every aspect of the day, and many said it was the best wedding they’d ever been to and probably will ever go to. Quite a few of the vendors made a point of communicating a similar sentiment to us as well!

Comminication is unparalleled, they will do everything they possible can to accommodate any request you may have, and worked tirelessly to provide us with an amazing experience.

We really did get to have a dream wedding, far beyond anything we could have ever imagined.

An immense thank you to everyone, the staff on-site, logistics team, event coordinators, etc… everyone came together to put us first and make the day the most amazing day of our lives."
V321,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Port Lympne is an incredible venue, such a unique and special location for your special day. We had spent our first weekend away as a couple there so it was great to go back 6 years later to get married.
All of our guests loved the venue and the day, and they still talk about the safari and how incredible it was.
Sadly for us, we were let down by the operations team on the day which caused unnecessary stress. The event team were great in the build up, with a few minor issues due to limited flexibility on their end. We also had about 3 different main points of contact due to staff turnover and therefore the package we agreed to and had changed and led to tense discussions. The issues for us arose on the day where the event team handed over the wedding to the operations team who we hadn't met and it seemed to be the first time they had heard of our wedding. Despite handing them a detailed folder explaining how the tables should be laid out, seating plans and all the other essentials, they made numerous mistakes resulting in the wedding party having to fix many of these just before the bride arrived! A few of our suppliers commented how it felt like the venue mustn't have had many weddings due to some of the issues on the day.

However, despite all of these challenges, everything else was magical. The venue spaces are incredible and the food was exceptional. The safari was a real highlight for us and all the guests."
V321,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"We couldn’t have chosen a more magical venue for our wedding than Port Lympne. The setting was absolutely breathtaking—our guests were in awe of the views and the atmosphere - and that was before the wedding started!

The team at Port Lympne went above and beyond to make sure every detail was perfect, allowing us to enjoy every moment without a worry. The pergola and the orangery looked phenomenal in sun!

provided such a charming space for our reception. The food was exceptional, tailored to our tastes, and so many of our guests commented on how delicious it was.

One of the highlights was incorporating the wildlife reserve into our day. After the meal all of our guests got on trucks for a guided safari, which they absolutely loved—it added such a unique and memorable touch to the whole experience.

We couldn’t recommend Port Lympne enough. It was truly the perfect venue, and we’ll cherish the memories of our special day forever."
V321,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Port Lympne is an absolutely stunning venue, from the moment you arrive, you can feel how special and beautiful it is. The pergola has been designed so beautifully, with faux flowers intertwined all around it. It doesn't need any further decorating, it is stunning. What is great about this too is that the staff can put up Perspex glass over the windows if the weather isn't ideal, or can leave the windows open for a nice breeze if the day is good. The orangery is breath taking. As a bride, the worry about making either of these areas look pretty was a job already completed. Easily, the best and most beautiful venue.

The Wedding Team are incredible from start to finish. Nothing is too much trouble, they respond quickly to emails. I felt so cared for throughout the entire process, both myself and my husband were impressed by them. It is more expensive than other venues, but they are worth it. I'd hire them again in a heartbeat. We changed things close to the wedding day, the team easily accommodated, we asked for a different area for the reception drinks (we had to pay for this), but again, the team said yes and adjusted the scheduling in a thoughtful manner so we had more time by the southern terrace.

Food is amazing. We had lots of compliments about this. They catered for a number of vegetarian and vegan guests with ease. The evening buffet was so good. Plenty of good high quality food. I really was impressed.

We had the safari between the meal and evening reception - it was the best. Guests loved it, we loved it.

Honestly the best venue and staff. I want to attend a PL wedding as a guest now!!"
V321,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Looking for a spectacular, unique venue with exceptional customer service? Look no further than Port Lympne! It's hard to find a better wedding venue. From the staff to the views, the facilities to the accommodation, and the food to the animals, everything is outstanding. Every member of staff goes above and beyond to make everyone feel welcome and to provide unforgettable experiences. Words like ""unbelievable,"" ""breathtaking,"" and ""stunning"" were frequently used by our guests, many of whom claimed it was the best wedding they had ever attended.

Special shout-outs go to…

Ceyda: Thank you for being our incredible wedding coordinator. Your responsiveness to countless emails and your dedication to making our big day exactly what we dreamed of were remarkable. Thank you for altering our function sheet so many times without question and for holding my drinks and fluffing my dress when needed!

Charlotte: Your calming presence and willingness to accommodate every request were invaluable. Thank you for keeping me calm in the morning and for your excellent communication throughout the day, ensuring everything ran seamlessly.

Our glorious toastmasters, Jonathan and Nikki: WOW, what a duo! Thank you for ensuring our day ran smoothly and for guiding our guests flawlessly. We (and our guests) loved both of your outfits, especially the park ranger uniforms.

Harry: Thank you for rescuing me and my bridesmaids when we locked ourselves out of Rhino Lodge.

Wedding breakfast serving staff: Your prompt, well-coordinated, and faultless delivery of our food was exceptional.

The chefs: Thank you for producing a mouthwatering three-course meal that was beautifully presented. Our guests couldn't believe the high standard of food and that all main courses were served hot. Thank you also for accommodating special requests and dietary requirements.

Evening bar staff: Your constant smiles and enthusiasm, especially joining in with the Macarena, added so much fun to our celebration.

Hotel staff: Thank you for assisting our overnight guests with check-in and ensuring their bags were taken to their rooms, allowing them to celebrate without interruption.

Our wedding at Port Lympne was a dream come true, thanks to the incredible team and the breathtaking venue. We highly recommend it to anyone looking for a truly magical wedding experience."
V321,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Venue
We opted for Port Lympne to start with as we were swept away with the beauty of the venue. It’s truly the most beautiful place we visited. The mansion house is a lovely reception area, the pergola and orangery are private so just your guests get to enjoy this section. The pergola is light and beautiful, and perfect backdrop for a ceremony. It’s really easy to dress up with flowers, as it’s already so beautiful it doesn’t take much.
The orangery is amazing, high ceilings, beautiful greenery & rose bushes surround the area. There’s lovely lawns which you have the option to play garden games on & have photos.
The Moroccan courtyard is perfect for photos, and again doesn’t need any extra dressing or decoration to make it look beautiful - it’s simply stunning everywhere!

The Wedding Team
First the venue sweeps you the way, then the staff do! They are extremely helpful, lovely and attentive. I emailed them a couple of times a week leading up to the big day and they replied within a few hours every time.
On the big day they weren’t overbearing, no request was too much & they were there whenever we needed them.
They do multiple walk throughs with you & introduce you to everyone who is working on your wedding so you know who to ask if there’s any additional requests.

Food & Drink
On the lead up, you get to try the wedding food. They also offer a choice of two for starters mains and desserts (in contrast to other venues we viewed which only allowed for one choice).
The food was incredible, rich and yummy (not dry at all which you sometimes find with wedding food).
The queue for the bar was quick all night (and we had over 100 guests who are all big drinkers). There was no draught beer which we were worried about, but it was fine on the day as this meant everyone was served quickly.
The wine they pair the food with was gorgeous - and again you get to try all this before the big day.
They were accommodating to vegetarians and multiple allergies. This was all planned before hand & we had no issues with this on our day.

Safari
We opted for safari and it was a really magical and memorable touch. All our guests loved it!
You also get to use the buggies the day after the wedding (up to 10am) which is a lovely way to recover from the wedding and a fun way to start your first day of marriage bliss!

There’s nothing more we could have asked for! Perfect for 100-150 guests."
V321,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Port Lympne was an outstanding venue the whole team amazing from the events team to the ground staff always welcoming and helpful up to the day and then the wedding itself.
Safari it’s a great added extra guests totally loved. The mansion house was a perfect venue that sold it for us on our first visit. Outstanding accommodation across the site and food across the day was perfect.
Thank you port lympne team."
V321,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Our October wedding at Port Lympne was stunning - we had our ceremony in the Pergola followed by a reception in The Orangery, and the day ran smoothly. The staff are friendly and accommodating, the venue itself is beautiful with very little additional decorations needed, the safari was a huge talking point and we've been told repeatedly that the food was the best anyone had at a wedding all year. We'd definitely recommend booking your wedding here, you won't regret it."
V321,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Port Lympne as it's no normal wedding venue, it's the Disneyland of Kent wedding venues. We would also like to say a big thank you to Stephanie who worked so hard to make sure the day was perfect. She made our dream weddings come true with Georgina, and Olivia, who handled every aspect of the day so well. All our guests were blown away and had the time of their lives. They keep telling us how perfect the venue was. It really does have it all: 5 star food, the most stunning spaces, water features, coastal views, and breathtaking grounds with animals from across the world (which all our guests got to see as part of our day). If you are looking for a venue that ticks all the boxes Port Lympne and the team can and will make this happen.The team managed everything so professionally, and they made our dream come true! Thank you from the bottom of our hearts."
V321,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"We were married at Port Lympne on the August bank holiday 2023 and would thoroughly recommend the venue.

The Port Lympne team were incredibly helpful and responsive throughout. No question or detail was too much for Stephanie and Annie, who provided an excellent standard of service; they were straightforward to deal with and any concerns or queries were dealt with swiftly.
The wedding day itself ran smoothly and was truly memorable for both us and our guests. The combination of the pergola and the orangery provide for a stunning venue. There are also so many locations for beautiful photos!

A key reason we chose Port Lympne was the high-quality food we had experienced on previous visits to the garden room. For our wedding breakfast, we selected the sea bass with brown crab gnocchi, which was delicious and enjoyed by all guests. There is also an option to select a second/alternative main for those who preferred a non-fish dish.

In the evening we surprised our guests with the safari; it is a must-do and made the day truly memorable and unique.

We also had over 50 guests staying at the venue overnight and Stephanie and Annie efficiently co-ordinated the transport and accommodation elements.

Overall, we had a fantastic day and would highly recommend Port Lympne to couples seeking a unique and special wedding day."
V322,Salomons Estate,"I am so happy my (now) husband and I decided to have our wedding here! Everything about our big day was nothing short of perfect. From the moment we looked at this venue, I know it was everything we wanted.

Our day of coordinator, Leah, was absolutely lovely. Not only is she attentive, but she is kind, thoughtful, and incredibly detail-oriented, making every part of the process seamless and stress-free. I can’t be more grateful to have had her by my side.

The venue decorated for the holidays just days before our wedding, providing us with beautiful added decor and magic! My friends and family love the many rooms and areas to explore, including the museum, gardens, bar, terrace, etc.

We opted for afternoon tea for our wedding breakfast and pizza for late night bites and our guests absolutely loved it! They offered options for our friends with gf, veggie, etc dietary requirements, and people raved about their meals! They have options for everyone.

Between the beautiful venue, genuinely lovely staff, and delicious food and drink, I cannot be more grateful to Leah and everyone at Salomons. I got to live out my fairytale dream wedding here, and I am so excited for every couple who chooses to do the same. You will have the best day of your lives."
V322,Salomons Estate,"The venue is absolutely stunning which our guests also commented on, from the impressive driveway entrance to the beautiful decor inside. We had our ceremony in the Gold Room which had so much detail we did not need to decorate too much further. We then moved through to the Drawing Room for our Wedding Breakfast and Evening Reception. This was the perfect size for our wedding and we were able to decorate the whole area (including the bar and lounge area) creating an inviting atmosphere. The staff are absolutely amazing, from the initial enquiry to the planning to the actual day. The Events team were always on hand to answer any questions or emails and the bar staff on the day were so polite and professional. Even after the wedding, the following day, the staff were still happy and helpful. The food is amazing and so tasty, it was served quickly and hot , allergies were very easily accommodated and the prosecco was lovely. There was nothing that was too much trouble and our Wedding Planner Leah could not do enough to make sure everything went well."
V322,Salomons Estate,"Salomons will now hold a special place in our heart forever. Thankyou so much for everything. Erin our coordinator was incredible and I’m so pleased with her ethics, friendliness and experience. Thankyou!"
V322,Salomons Estate,"We had a summer wedding at Salomons and were lucky enough to have an outdoor ceremony and cocktail hour. It was the perfect place to host our guests (we had 140 guests) and there was a lot of space for everyone to explore, sit and walk around.
We had many compliments about the quality of the food. Our suppliers even said it was the best meal they'd had while working! We did the Sharing Roast and having the guests in chef's hat to carve the roast was a very popular part of our day.
I can't compliment the events team at Salomon's enough. In the last month before the wedding, they were so responsive and went above and beyond. We had a few changes in staff on their side and changed our main coordinator but it had 0 impact to the quality of our day.
On the day, our coordinator Willow was exceptional - keeping the show running and making sure that everyone was well looked after.
We were beyond happy with our wedding and Salomon's will always hold a special place in our heart!"
V322,Salomons Estate,"What can I say, this is a beautiful venue for start. We had Willow as our coordinator and she was beyond perfect! She made sure everything was on point and was excellent with communication! The staff on the day were so helpful and friendly, everyone was raving about them. It was just amazing! I wish we could do it again! Our wedding was three weeks ago, so we are still on cloud 9. The venue catered for all our guests dietaries & were amazing with accommodation!"
V322,Salomons Estate,"Salomons Estate was more than I could have asked for. Erin, our coordinator, was so on top of things throughout the day and so helpful. We had to plan this whole thing from abroad and it was quite stressful but Erin was so calm throughout the process and there were no issues whatsoever. The venue was absolutely beautiful and such a great space for hold events - highly highly recommend! Also, the food was excellent!"
V322,Salomons Estate,"I cannot recommend getting married at Salomons Estate enough.

The whole team are amazing to work with and when first visiting I felt so relaxed and at ease in their company - a lot of other venues felt very pushy in comparison looking back.

We absolutely loved that they had so many options in regards to food and drinks packages. We went for their bbq option which was perfect as we didn’t want a 3 course sit down, we wanted something a bit more relaxed. The food was delicious and everyone said they felt really full compared to some other weddings they’d been to!

The grounds themselves are stunning. We were so fortunate that we got married on the terrace, but the back up room inside was also beautiful if the weather hadn’t been on our side! We had our reception in the science theatre that is such a unique room and so beautiful.

Our wedding parties stayed the night before in the gatehouse and the bridal cottage, most of our wedding party also stayed the evening of the wedding in the hotel accommodation. This really extended our wedding celebration and I’m so grateful we could all stay on site in lovely accommodation.

I could go on and on for hours, but to summarise; the venue is not only stunning but is matched in amazing service."
V322,Salomons Estate,"Salomons was a beautiful location for a wedding! We had a winter wedding and chose it because we liked the indoor setup for our wedding for approximately 100 people, and also wanted on site accommodation. However, the grounds are beautiful and we got lucky with the weather and have had many pretty shots taken outside.

The events team helped us pull together our wedding plan and ensured matters ran smoothly on the day. We had a great time with the tasting in the lead up to our wedding. We also used a number of the recommended suppliers from Salomons and together they put together a truly amazing wedding. Erin helped coordinate our day and also chaueffered us around for our photos as the grounds were a bit wet!

The catering team did a top job on the day. Our guests were raving about how good the food was, and how generous the portions were too! Salomons offered a good selection of wines and their F&B team were flexible to try to source drinks that weren't readily available on the menu. If needed, we were able to supply our own bottles and pay corkage.

My father has some health issues, and the team did everything they could to make his experience on the day as comfortable as possible. I'm really grateful to Salomons for this.

In summary, I'd highly recommend Salomons Estate as a venue for anyone considering a wedding venue in Kent."
V322,Salomons Estate,"We knew instantly when we arrived to view the venue that this was where we wanted to get married. We were made to feel at home, and nothing felt like too much bother. The team were constantly on-hand to answer questions throughout the process, and catered to all of our requests. We had never really thought about an outside wedding, but the South Terrace took our breath away when we saw it in person!
Our wedding day was magical, and ran completely smoothly due to the hard work of the team throughout the day. Our guests commented on the service of the team - there was never a queue at the bar, there was always someone on-hand to help out, and our wedding planner (Fiona) had this magic ability of being everywhere at once! The food was outstanding, and our guests were well-fed and watered during the day. We honestly couldn’t have asked for more from the team!"
V322,Salomons Estate,"We got married at Salomons Estate in June 2023 and it was incredible! We literally have zero negatives to write. Everything from Fiona and her team was brilliant. The care and attention to detail, the day went smoothly and perfect.
All of our guests commented on how delicious the canapés and food were.
We will 10000% be returning for our anniversary.
Thank you everyone at Salomons for ensuring we had the most perfect day."
V323,The Castle Westenhanger,"We had our special day here in April 2024 and all we can say is incredible!

The booking process was easy and so personal, the online planning system was so easy to use and the Westenhanger team were always at the end of an email if we needed anything at all - nothing was too much trouble.
The day went perfectly to plan thanks to the wonderful wedding coordinators, the food was amazing, the DJ was brilliant - genuinely there was nothing we would have changed.

We can’t thank the Westenhanger team enough for everything that they have done in making sure that our wedding day was perfect."
V323,The Castle Westenhanger,"We had an incredible day and are still getting so many compliments from our guests and suppliers on how beautiful the different parts of the castle and its grounds are. It was an unusual wedding (queer Jewish/Christian interfaith), but Jackie, Vicky and co helped to make sure that we had all the things that were important to us, from the vegan food and alcohol-free drinks to the gender neutral toilets to getting the dancing going before the meal had even started. The ceremony room was perfect (and a special thank you to the person who went up on a ladder to put a covering over the boar head that's mounted on the wall!), and we had some amazing photos and videos back from our photographers/videographer highlighting the beauty across the entire venue. We also really appreciate that the company running the venue sent many of the key staff members on trans awareness training so that we could have the most gender-affirming day possible. Thank you Westenhanger team!"
V323,The Castle Westenhanger,"This place is a gem and an absolutely stunning setting for special occasions. We had our daughter’s wedding there in June. The staff were attentive from the moment we first visited to look around, to the time we left having packed up everything the morning after the wedding. The food was delicious and generous portions the drinks were flowing. The castle is authentic and steeped in history which gives it a magical atmosphere."
V323,The Castle Westenhanger,"I can honestly say hand on heart that a typical ‘Wedding’ was not a bit of me. However, there is nothing Typical about Westernhanger.

The magic is created as soon as you walk in and even more so on my day as we had snow!! Transported into a winter wonderland with the most beautiful atmosphere and decorations.

The staff were honestly so incredible and I cannot even begin to thank you for guiding me through my day. You took everything out of my hands and I trusted you all. Your professionalism and expertise ensured that our day ran smoothly. Every single guest commented on how amazing the dinner service was and so professional. Also the food was stunning.

The evening DJ was great and although I took a turn for the worst, due to a sickness bug I couldn’t help but get up and boogie. The evening guests shared that the buffet was incredible.

On behalf of my Husband and I we would like to thank you all for creating and being a part of the most magical day. And if you’re anything like me and do not do ‘Typical’ this is the place for you. Westernhanger will always have a place in our hearts and we’ve made our own history in this incredible historical place."
V323,The Castle Westenhanger,"The team at Westenhanger were so warm and welcoming. We had travelled from up north to come down and looked at multiple venues. The castle was the only venue that we got emotional at. It is gorgeous. We had a huge numbers of friends and family travel down for the day, and many have said it's the best wedding they've ever been to. We did find that perhaps coordination was slightly lax for us, but that could be more of a criticism of ourselves. A really, really lovely team of people. Thank you!"
V323,The Castle Westenhanger,"Tania, Jackie and Bex are an absolutely amazing team. We had such a chill wedding day with everything running smoothly. The Castle grounds are beautiful and looked amazing in the October sunshine. The inside of the castle is perfect for the ceremony and the marquee is great for the reception. We really wanted photos in the dovecote and they turned out lovely."
V323,The Castle Westenhanger,"Westenhanger Castle is an absolutely amazing wedding venue! From the moment we set foot on the grounds, we were blown away by its beauty and historical charm. The staff at Westenhanger Castle couldn't have been more helpful throughout the entire wedding planning process. They went above and beyond to ensure that our special day was perfect in every way.

The team at Westenhanger Castle was incredibly accommodating, helping us with every aspect of our wedding, from selecting the ideal ceremony location to assisting with catering and decorating decisions. Their professionalism and dedication to making our day unforgettable were truly remarkable.

Our guests were also captivated by the beauty of the venue and the warmth of the staff. We received numerous compliments about the exceptional service and the incredible ambiance throughout the day.

In conclusion, Westenhanger Castle is not just a wedding venue; it's a fairytale setting where dreams come true. We couldn't have asked for a better place to start our journey together, and we are immensely grateful for the exceptional support we received from the staff. If you're looking for a wedding venue that combines history, beauty, and exceptional service, Westenhanger Castle is the perfect choice"
V323,The Castle Westenhanger,All the staff from start to Finnish and after are amazing. From enquiries to information and service. Spectacular venue. If you’re looking for honestly care love and so much more. This is the venue. No faults here. Food is wonderful. Would highly recommend!! Zach and jo
V323,The Castle Westenhanger,"From our first meeting, the staff were so welcoming, knowledgeable and responsive to any queries we had throughout the planning process. We had a lot of guests with dietary requirements, so the choice of menus was important to us when choosing a venue. There was a great selection of meals to choice from and the chefs were accommodating where we needed to tweak things!

The venue itself is of course stunning and a real stand out feature is the space for both the bridal party and groomsmen to get ready for the big day! All the staff on the day made sure everything went smoothly and we were able to relax and enjoy the day!"
V323,The Castle Westenhanger,"We cannot recommend The Castle at Westenhanger enough. Quite simply the best. A totally professional team who made our day so special. Everyone and everything was perfect and far exceeded our expectations. On top of this, the team really did make us feel more like friends than customers and really did seem as excited as we were about the day. From day one of planning to clearing up our things the day after, we were met with smiles and hugs and made to feel genuinely special. If you want good old fashioned professional service wrapped in the friendliest of company at a venue that looks stunning, then you have found the perfect venue in Westenhanger."
V324,Lympne Castle,"We couldn't be happier with how our wedding turned out. The venue is just stunning - a beautiful castle, lovely grounds, and overlooking the sea. We had a very small wedding of 15 guests, and we were treated like royalty. We had access to the full castle and spent the day wandering between different sections, enjoying every single one. The food (we had a BBQ) was delicious, and the staff were wonderful. It was all coordinated by Joy who was a pleasure to work with. She spent the day seamlessly coordinating everything behind the scenes, whilst looking after and playing with our dog which was such an appreciated touch! We stayed at the cottages on the castle and they were fantastic. Not only big and full of character, but it also made logistics so much easier having our guests at the location. The new castle bistro (the Naughty Dog) also meant everyone had a place to meet, drink and eat inbetween wedding events.

The best thing about the castle is that it caters for all types of weather. So no matter what you get on the day, you'll still have an incredible experience.

Finals things: the photos you'll get will be outstanding. What a backdrop! And the prices are extremely reasonable. We highly highly recommend this venue."
V324,Lympne Castle,"Great venue, beautiful and so many amazing comments from our guests. The different rooms and spaces made it more and gave the variety we wanted

The team also worked very well to be flexible with last minute changes to make it work and I can’t thank them enough for that

The views are stunning"
V324,Lympne Castle,"So we got married in the church (next door) and hired out one of the rooms in the castle for our reception.

I can’t fault the service. It was spectacular and really made our day special. I don’t think I’ve ever had service like that where the staff are so professional, personable and just amazing all round. We were aware that we didn’t hire out the venue or anything like that specifically for our wedding - it was a room in the castle so we didn’t really expect much. But the staff made us feel like we did. They even roped in some of the gardeners to pull smoke bombs for one of our pictures! The staff made every effort. Laura and Mike were great and went beyond expectations. We just have no complaints at all with anything. It was an amazing day.

The castle itself is picture perfect and for us was the perfect setting. It’s rich in history and the attention to details is incredible. There’s multiple rooms of varying sizes. We had a small wedding so hired out one of the smaller rooms but it looks like they can cater to a wedding of any size. We also stayed in one of the cottages within the castle grounds along with the guests which were equally perfect.

Pretty much every wedding I’ve been to the food has been mediocre at best. But the food here was great. Everybody really enjoyed the food. The kitchen obviously know what they’re doing so kudos to them.

This is honestly the best place to have your wedding. You’re in very safe hands with the staff here, the castle is gorgeous (and the views!) and the we couldn’t think of a better place to do it.

Thank you for the special day!"
V324,Lympne Castle,"Our wedding day was absolutely faultless from start to finish! The wedding team were so helpful and knowledgable throughout the planning process and our coordinator Dan looked after us for our wedding day - thank you Dan!
Lympne Castle is such a beautiful venue, and we can't wait to visit again once the castle bedrooms are ready!
Love, Sarah & Tom"
V324,Lympne Castle,"From start to finish, the staff at Lympne Castle were amazing. Professional, courteous, and incredibly helpful. We planned our own wedding, and although I feared it would become overwhelming, Kate made it so easy for us. The day came off without a hitch and everything was just beautiful, from the venue to the food. I am so grateful to all the wonderful staff, Kate and Mike, Joy, and all the sweet and charming servers. You made our wedding perfect!"
V324,Lympne Castle,"Lympne Castle could not have made our wedding day more special, it was a beautiful and intimate occasion from start to finish. We got to decorate the chairs as we liked and having the rooms to get changed in made it very easy in the end. The food was good and the staff very helpful, especially Mike and Laura. Everything was thought about and all ideas welcomed and accommodated where possible. We had the best day and would repeat it in a heartbeat to soak it all up again. The castle was a little bit of history that made the start of our adventure even more magical. Thank you to everyone at Lympne Castle."
V324,Lympne Castle,"Lympne Castle was truly perfect in every way. The Bridal Suite is stunning and was such a great space to enjoy the morning with my bridal party. We were lucky enough to get married on the lawn outside, the view is unbelievable and our guests were wowed! Our wedding breakfast was held in the Great Hall and genuinely felt like something out of a fairytale. The food throughout the day was amazing and the staff were so attentive and accommodating - especially our wedding coordinator Kate (we can’t thank you enough!!). I’d recommend Lympne Castle in a heart beat and our guests still talk about how magical the venue was - can we do it again please?! Love, Mr & Mrs J"
V324,Lympne Castle,"I could not imagine anywhere else more perfect for a wedding. It was our first and only venue viewing, we fell so in love with it that we booked a date there and then. We loved that our ceremony, reception and accommodation (we used the cottages) were all within the grounds plus the added bonus of the new bridal preparation room. We also had the benefit of Christmas trees and log fires which made our winter wedding particularly festive in the castle setting. The building and views are stunning - our guests were in awe! Aimee, our coordinator was first class in communications, expertise and ensuring the preparations and day ran to schedule. Nothing was too much trouble for her, even helping the grooms party with their buttonholes, a kind and personal touch. The staff were fabulous too and made us all smile with their lovely comments about our celebrations. The brilliant chefs offer an impressive menu, catering for all dietary choices and it is both delicious and beautifully presented. Lympne Castle had everything we could have wished for and more, it is a truly special venue, one of a kind."
V324,Lympne Castle,"Lympne Castle is the most perfect wedding venue. Not only is it absolutely stunning, has roaring fires, beautiful grounds and views but you get the whole venue exclusive which for us was a big bonus!

From the moment we booked it as a venue we were assigned a wedding coordinator - ours was Aimee and she was fantastic! Anything we needed she was super quick to reply and so helpful. We visited the castle lots and went to one of their dinner nights (which I highly recommend.) Our wedding day couldn't have been as smooth as it was if it wasn't for Aimee and her staff they made everything so easy for us and she even held my umbrella and helped me across to the church in the morning.

Everything that the staff do is perfect - the food is superb and the whole venue flows nicely for guests. If you are thinking of getting married here look no further or even for a party - it's a fantastic venue and you won't be disappointed."
V324,Lympne Castle,"well what can I say!! an amazing venue with fantastic staff. From beginning to end we were given so much personal service from everyone at the castle but Aimee was amazing!!! from small little touches around the castle to making me and my now husband feel calm before the big moment...Aimee must have had a Mary Poppins bag as she had everything we needed on hand from sewing kits to mints, scissors and glue and we couldn't have asked for a better day. Thank you for making our day so special ...even to the last touch of a hug goodbye this morning ."
V325,Chafford Park,Amazing venue for our wedding in the summer. Alicia and Sarah worked really hard to make sure we had the best day possible. Both the indoor and outdoor ceremony areas are beautiful and the main barn is a perfect setting for food and dancing. Couldn’t recommend highly enough.
V325,Chafford Park,"Chafford Park is a beautiful hidden gem in the glorious English countryside. From the moment we visited, we felt welcomed and really put at ease by the team and the family. The grounds are stunning, with so many opportunities to explore and capture our favourite moments!
With of having use of the two spacious barns to use we were able to really bring our vision to life, and the day panned out perfectly. The venue hire includes the day before your wedding to set everything up, and we booked to stay in the onsite accommodation in the Long Barn (a must!), which really put my nerves at ease knowing that everything was taken care of before the day.

Sarah and the team were extremely helpful, ensuring we had everything we needed for the day. All of our suppliers went above and beyond, the waiting and bar team were super attentive and great fun!

We had so many of our guests commenting on the venue, the service and the day itself, we just couldn't have asked for more.

We honestly couldn't have imagined our day being any better, we are still on a high from the entire day and cannot recommend this venue highly enough. Thank you so much!!"
V325,Chafford Park,"We knew we wanted to hold our big day at Chafford Park as soon as we first visited the previous spring. We always wanted a venue which was a blank canvas that we could put our own stamp on and it was perfect for this, with the two beautiful barns for us to dress and decorate for the ceremony and wedding breakfast and free reign on our choice of cater, but with a emphasis on trying to keep it local which we liked. The journey for the bridal party from the house to the ceremony barn is beautiful too, passed the pond and through the trees.

As we both work in events we loved having the bell tents as the backdrop for our friends to stay in and having the fire pits and festoon at night time gave the outside area a real festival feel.
It was also a big plus that we could stay on site for two nights - we legally got married on the Friday with a small group of family and friends and then cooked a big meal in the house that night.

Alicia and Sarah were helpful and prompt with any queries in the lead up and we’re very grateful to Charlotte who made sure everything ran smoothly for us on the day itself too.

We hope to return one day for a glamping weekend and to reminisce."
V325,Chafford Park,"We recently celebrated our wedding at Chafford Park, and it was an absolute dream!

The team's dedication to making our wedding unforgettable, from the initial planning stages to the last dance, the staff demonstrated a fabulous level of commitment. They took care of every detail, ensuring that our vision came to life seamlessly.

Our guests couldn't stop raving about the stunning venue. The charm of the barns, coupled with the picturesque surroundings, created a warm and romantic atmosphere that perfectly complemented our day. The natural beauty of Chafford Park added an extra layer of magic to our celebration, making the entire weekend feel like a fairytale. Waking up in the long barn was nothing short of glorious. The tranquillity of the setting and the connection with nature created a serene and peaceful atmosphere. It was the perfect way to start our journey as a married couple.

We loved having the use of two barns one for the ceremony and the other for our reception and the transition from one space to another was seamless, and it made the entire event flow effortlessly. We appreciated the thoughtfulness behind this arrangement, allowing us to savour every moment without any stress.

Our experience at Chafford Park was beyond our wildest dreams. If you're looking for a venue that combines natural beauty, thoughtful design, and a dedicated team, Chafford Park is the perfect choice."
V325,Chafford Park,"Could not recommend Chafford Park more. It is such a beautiful venue and the team are constantly improving and adding extra touches to the venue.

I loved the ability to chose our own caterers - I was able to bring in my African heritage by choosing an African caterer and it really made the day feel unique and special to us.

The sound system is unusual but once you are underneath it, it is great. We worked with a recommend DJ and saxophonist from Mint DJs who were really great and got the party started.

The added touch of having rooms on site for the family really made it easier. We were able to have a lovely family dinner the night before and able to enjoy the farm for the full three days.

Really was our dream day and we are so grateful."
V325,Chafford Park,"Where to start...what a beautiful wedding venue. So picturesque and relaxed. The grounds feel luxurious and private without losing the homely aspects we wanted for our special day. We knew when we looked at Chafford Park that it was the perfect place for our wedding. Sarah, Alicia and Catherine are an excellent team who have an eye for detail and really made sure we were looked after throughout the lead up and on the day. All questions are answered promptly and with care. The landscaped area around the stunning barns provide a perfect backdrop for photos and the barns made the most intimate space for our ceremony and reception. We are so grateful for the time and care to make our day so special. Highly recommend to go and view Chafford park and find out why it is just so special."
V325,Chafford Park,"Even though we had torrential rain on the day, Catie and Sarah made the day flow really well. All staff were incredible and so friendly. The grounds are incredible too. We wanted a laid back wedding with a slight rustic vibe and this delivered! Thank you all, I just wish I could do it all again xx"
V325,Chafford Park,"By far the most beautiful wedding location I have been to. The estate owners and staff were so professional and truly went above and beyond to make my sisters wedding the most special day of her life. Thank you Sarah, Alicia and the team! X"
V325,Chafford Park,"Despite the stunning facade of this venue, its owners and managers are incredibly rude, making planning and having a wedding at Chafford Park an uncomfortable experience.

On our first visit before booking, we loved what the venue offered and how beautiful it was. Sarah the owner was pleasant and kind and we consequently booked a week later.
However after booking, there followed 12 months of terrible communication, pulling back on previous promises made and generally being very uncompromising with our plans.
We didn’t feel Sarah or her daughter Alicia were on our side at any point and felt that they were more concerned about keeping their venue pristine than helping people have a beautiful wedding.

We had such a magical wedding day, despite them. Our guests and vendors contributed to an incredible day and I didn’t feel stressed at all. But behind the scenes, our catering staff and wedding coordinator were having to deal with so much hostility from the managers. They came in, in the middle of service to tell the staff that the kitchen area was too messy!! So incredibly rude and completely unprofessional. And this was only one incident amongst many that I heard post wedding where they were rude and disrespectful towards vendors and guests alike.

You are also obliged to partner with Wild Box to serve the drinks when you book this venue - they work closely with Chafford Park so essentially are almost as hostile. There are many things that you can’t do - put up your own decorations, bring your own alcohol or have a campfire past midnight. We luckily found our way around all of this but they made the whole thing so difficult and uncomfortable.

I would encourage anyone to not be lured in by the beautiful surroundings and look elsewhere if you want a more friendly and compromising service."
V325,Chafford Park,"We had the most amazing wedding at Chafford Park! It really is the most stunning venue, especially in June when everything is in full bloom. We really wanted as many of our friends to be able to stay with us across the whole weekend and this venue offered just that. The Glamping tents were a huge hit with our guests and the long barn where we stayed was beautiful (and perfect for getting all the girls glammed up on the big day!) Being able to access the venue from Friday morning until Sunday midday meant we could fully enjoy time with firends and family who had travelled so far to be with us.

Alicia and Sarah were so helpful, making sure everything was just as we wanted it and that the day ran smoothly. We couldn’t have pictured a more perfect place for our wedding and can’t wait to return for some more glamping in the years to come!"
V326,The Ferry House,"Where do we start with this review? Well, if you are looking for a venue that has practically everything this is it. The staff are fantastic, they were brilliant from the day we booked it and even after the event. They were helpful all the way through the journey and on the day the staff we great. Our guests had the most amazing time and all said it was one of the best weddings they had been too. Granted the weather helped, but a mild sunny day in April made it perfect. The food was 10 out of 10, really do recommend the upgrade on the menu choices and wine. The in house DJ was also excellent. In fact everything went to plan, there was nothing negative just the perfect magical day."
V326,The Ferry House,"We got married at the Ferry House last Saturday and had the most amazing magical day and that was all down to the incredible team at The Ferry House.
Sam & Chloe were our wedding coordinators on the day and they were absolutely faultless, the day ran perfectly and that was all down to them both.
The food was incredible and every one of our guests commented on how amazing the food quality was.
The rooms were super comfortable.
The venue overall was just incredible, we would highly recommend anyone getting married to celebrate here.
Thank you all"
V326,The Ferry House,"This venue is a hidden gem, we didn't know about it until we were looking at Venues and we instantly knew this was the place for us. Relaxed, rustic, caring and everything in one place! The venue itself is so warm and inviting with the log burning fires, rustic bar, barn and amazing surroundings. The team go above and beyond to make your day extra special.
The food selection is amazing, we had the hog roast which everyone commented on!
Thank you to everyone at The Ferry House, our day was amazing!"
V326,The Ferry House,"Our winter wedding at The Ferry House was just perfect, and that is all thanks to the amazing team. The care and attention to detail they had to understanding our vibe and making our vision come to life was just second to none. We have so many amazing memories of the day and also the planning stages. The setting was beautiful, the food and drink were amazing, and the staff were all super friendly.
All of our guests loved everything about the day and are still talking about it now.
Thank you so much for making our wedding dreams come true, core memory made!"
V326,The Ferry House,"Our special day tailored to our exact requirements, staff professional from original viewing to the day, cannot thank them enough, what they always say about a good place is the staff make the venue, and they sure do at the ferry house. Beautiful venue in picturesque surroundings worth every penny"
V326,The Ferry House,"The Ferry house is an absolutely amazing , our wedding day was magical .
Our guests all said what a beautiful venue .
The food is outstanding and all the staff are very helpful. From the first planning meeting up to the day of the wedding .
Nothing was to much trouble if I had a query they was always at the end of email .
Myself and the bridal party stayed at the cottages the night before , this really added to the excitement of our wedding day .
The rooms at the Ferry house are decorated to a high standard and are very comfortable. The food is amazing.
We would highly recommend this venue . Our wedding day was perfect ."
V326,The Ferry House,"I don’t even know where to start - the Ferry House was the perfect venue for our big day. Nothing was too much trouble and they made the whole planning process so easy. I have worked at weddings myself and know how venues can sometimes be difficult and reluctant to help with certain things but not the Ferry House!
They decorated the venue with my diy decorations without any issues, they answered my constant emails (crazy quickly!) and even put up with me doing everything last minute!
The actual day itself, they were so helpful, excited for us and just made us feel amazing!
The venue is just absolutely gorgeous - nearly every guest came up to us on the day to tell us how amazing it was and they honestly felt it was the best wedding they had been to! All thanks to the Ferry House. If we could do it all again we would both choose the ferry house again in an instant."
V326,The Ferry House,"We just wanted to say a huge thank you to the whole Ferry House team for all of their hard work, support, kindness and helpfulness in making our day so incredibly perfect. Our guests were so amazed, and keep telling us as much!

It wouldn't have been as wonderful without the team all part of it, and Josh was the best DJ! He played some absolute tunes. Owen took great care of everyone down by the firepit.

Chef and his team put out some absolutely incredible food, everyone has been raving about it since. The food was simply perfect, we're having roast dinner withdrawals at this point....

Katy took care of me and pampered me for six months in the run up to the wedding with the facials, definitely one of the best parts of wedding planning, she got rid of any worries in each session, I will definitely be continuing with those, I miss her already! They should be a must for every bride to be!

Maxine & Georgina, where can we start? They were both the most organised, reassuring, fantastic team, they were truly perfect, being the calming voices of reason, and helping move everything indoors in the morning.

We would write an essay about how amazing each and every one of the Ferry House team are. Every single one of the Ferry House team are truly one in a million, and TFH are very lucky to have them all."
V326,The Ferry House,"Our son has just been married at The ferry house.
From start to finish the staff and wedding team have been incredible!
The attention to detail, care and kindness of all the staff is the best we have ever received. They were simply amazing.
The venue itself, is totally worth the journey .
It was absolutely stunning and took our breath away when we saw it decorated.
We stayed overnight and the rooms were beautiful, clean and really comfortable.
Our buffet breakfast in the morning was delicious, full of fresh produce.
The food did not disappoint, it was the best wedding breakfast meal we have had.
Congratulations on a top star venue and a brilliant team of staff from the washing up lady to the wedding planners (Maxine was especially brilliant and also our assigned host who never stopped smiling despite our requests for this and that).
Thank you one and all for making Harry & Dan’s day totally amazing! We couldn’t have asked for more ."
V326,The Ferry House,"The best team of people you could ask for! Every single person we spoke with was so helpful and lovely to deal with. They made our day so special and run seamlessly! We couldn’t have asked for a better team!
The food and drink is the best around, locally sourced making it all taste so much better! And the views, away from everything so you can really soak in the day with your loved ones with no distractions!
Couldn’t ask for more"
V327,Hayne House,"I fell in love with Hayne House the second we went to our viewing and it only got better from there.
The pre-wedding process with the team at Hayne House was amazing, they were so accommodating and responsive and had answers to all the question that my Type A Bride brain threw at them. Throughout the planning process they were fabulous and it was so nice to find a venue where we could both get ready on site in the morning.
On the day, the Hayne House team (Beth) were absolutely fabulous. Beth kept me calm all morning and made me feel like we were in safe hands. We DIY-ed all our decor and Beth asked my input on the set up before the Groom turned up which really put me at ease. Beth also managed our ceremony music on a phone and it just made me feel so comfortable. Pre-aisle walk, Beth really helped me understand what would happen and really set my nerves at ease. The whole team were incredible and they made our day so so perfect.
We couldn't have asked for more. The venue is stunning and the team are amazing! I would recommend Hayne House to absolutely anyone! We also really loved the sustainability initiative, as we're both conscious of that, and that's what initially made us look at Hayne House. 100000% would recommend!"
V327,Hayne House,"We were married at Hayne House in August 2024, it was one of only 2 venues we selected to view at relatively short notice (we decided to give ourselves only 6 months planning time and were lucky they had availability for our chosen weekend!) - Sam was the first person we met and so welcoming. She really helped us imagine, in the cold of winter, how our summer wedding could be. We absolutely fell in love with the orangery from seeing the photos, but the reality was even better. Our key criteria was a venue that felt like a summer garden party, and you really got a sense of the lovely grounds by being able to see out to them all around you, even from inside the venue.
Becky gave us some great guidance throughout the planning, and Ella and team made the day run very smoothly.
6 months later, our guests are still talking about the beautiful relaxing day - it was everything we imagined - and better!"
V327,Hayne House,"Safe for the children to run around already beautiful so don't need to much decoration, staff couldn't of done any more on the day to help."
V327,Hayne House,"Hayne House was absolutely perfect.
The wedding Co ordinator Ella was so professional. She kept everyone calm and organised throughout the day. Would highly reccomend Hayne House as a wedding venue everything was fantastic!"
V327,Hayne House,"Hayne House was just the most perfect setting for our wedding. It’s private and beautiful surroundings coupled with amazing staff, food and suppliers - we couldn’t have asked for more or had a better day."
V327,Hayne House,We couldn’t have asked for a more superb venue and team! They made sure we had everything we needed on the day and we’re just so kind and helpful leading up to the wedding. They answered all our queries super quickly and the whole day just felt like a breeze!
V327,Hayne House,Hayne House is a beautiful wedding venue with a amazing team of staff! They supported us every step of the way and made sure everything ran smoothly on the day. They go above and beyond to make sure everything is perfect. I would especially recommend Hayne House if you have children as they are free to play the entire day! We had so many comments from guests about how beautiful the venue is and how amazing the staff are.
V327,Hayne House,"The team have curated a flawless operation at Hayne House which is so clear. The team ensured the day ran seamlessly and were amazing throughout the day and also during the lead up to our wedding which made it so stress-free and easy for us! There was not one thing that we needed to worry about on the day, the team handled EVERYTHING!! We had the best day and we're so pleased we chose Hayne House for our wedding, it was perfect!"
V327,Hayne House,"Had our wedding at Hayne House in June 2023- cannot fault a single thing with the team, services or facilities. Am so glad we chose Hayne House and would recommend to anyone wanting to get married stress free with a fantastic team who truly take the pressure off of wedding planning and are extremely flexible with requests and adjustments. Very good value for money and honestly all expectations were exceeded! Everything was well thought of and planned, there were no surprises and communication was excellent from the moment we made initial contact. Was such a special and memorable day due to the efforts and high quality of care and services at Hayne House."
V327,Hayne House,"As soon as we saw Hayne House we knew it was the perfect venue. The team are so welcoming and lovely. To the lead up to the big day they helped with everything. On the big day they may us feel at ease. I cannot recommend this venue enough, all of our guests said what a beautiful venue it is. They made our day so special, we enjoyed every little bit of it, thank you to all the team!"
V328,Bradbourne House,"My son had his wedding at Bradbourne House, the venue was beautiful, the staff were so helpful from start to finish, food was absolutely amazing, the toastmaster was a credit to the venue making this a day him and his new wife will never forget I would thoroughly recommend Bradbourne House for a wedding venue."
V328,Bradbourne House,"We had our reception here from the moment we arrived we were looked after and our guests were well informed. Hannah was fantastic and made our evening run smoothly and nothing was too much for her, she even helped me with my dress before my first dance and always asked if I was okay. Lauren was our first point of contact and she is lovely as is Rebecca. Thank you all so much. I would definitely recommend Bradbourne house not just for its beauty and privacy but for its team too."
V328,Bradbourne House,"On Saturday 27th October 2018 Julie and I had our renewal of Vows celebration at Bradbourne house, from our initial contact with Lauren at the Wedding Fair to the tasting menu to the day itself was a professional and dedicated service.

Bradbourne House has understood our requirements and ensured that the delivery of these were met without fuss or bother.

The food delivered from the Head Chef from Canapes to Wedding Breakfast to the Hog roast in the evening was first class.

The day itself ran like clockwork and the staff were again professional in their duties to ensure that all our guests were looked after.

It was a 5 star experience and we are already booking for our milestone birthdays in the next year or so.

A special thanks to Lauren and Head Chef who went beyond the call of duty to make it that special."
V328,Bradbourne House,"To all the fabulous staff and Bradbourne House, thank you so very much for your wonderful wedding organisation, wine knowledge, kitchen and food skills and ability to put on a great day as a team. You are all fantastic and a real asset to your employers. We are so very glad that we chose you as our venue. A no hassle and pleasant experience from start to finish. Wonderful! Thank you!"
V328,Bradbourne House,"From start to finish, Bradbourne House was wonderful in delivering the most perfect wedding reception for us. The house and gardens are absolutely beautiful and give you a great amount of space. What really made it was the staff. Everyone from the events team who worked with us for months beforehand, to the fantastic team on the day who thought of everything we hadn't and were there whenever we needed them. It meant we were free to enjoy the company of our guests and not worry about a thing. Perfect day and can't recommend it enough for a dream wedding venue."
V328,Bradbourne House,"To all at Bradbourne House.

Just a big thank you for making the Wedding of Paul and David such a memorable day. The venue was delightful and everything you did made it the most wonderful occasion. Everyone said it was the best wedding they had ever attended! The weather, the setting, the staff and the food was absolutely perfect.

So as the mother of Paul i thank you so much for a day to remember, it was absolutely flawless.
Thank you all again."
V328,Bradbourne House,Just a little note to say a big thank you for making our day run so smoothly. It all went perfectly for us and everybody was so complimentary of Bradbourne House.
V328,Bradbourne House,"To all at Bradbourne... thanks so much for making it a super special day for me and Emma. Your whole team was superb, especially Charlotte, and made the day very easy for us. We had so many nice comments from guests about the venue, the food and the staff. A few pics as requested!"
V328,Bradbourne House,"We just wanted to say a massive thank you to all of you and the fantastic team that helped make the day special!
The staff and service were all exceptional and nearly all the guests commented on the high standard of service and professionalism of your team. Food... Amazing!!

Thank you all so much. You took the pressure off before and during the wedding and delivered to us a day that no one will forget for a long time to come."
V328,Bradbourne House,"I attended Bradbourne House on Saturday 18th June for my cousin wedding.

I am unable to eat wheat/gluten so passed this on to the bride and groom beforehand.

I am just getting in touch to say how great your staff were at facilitating my needs! The food was delicious and they made sure it was gluten free for me. In the evening fish and chips and bacon sandwiches were being served. I was unable to have the fish as covered in wheat but a very kind gentleman brought me out two bacon sandwiches in gluten free rolls. This was very much appreciated. I was also advised the chips were gluten free!

Thank you for being so accommodating. It is much appreciated!"
V329,Westerham Golf Club,"We cannot express how grateful and happy we were with Westerham Golf Club. All of the staff were amazing and our event managers made sure we were always kept up to date and incredibly quick to reply (even though we bombarded them with our silly questions!) They made us feel so at ease and took care of all the little details they we didn't even think of! The food was delicious and they ensured that everyone was catered for. If you want a beautiful, seamless wedding experience, Westerham Golf Club is the place to book!"
V329,Westerham Golf Club,"Everything about this venue was just perfect. From our first visit up until our wedding date, the team at Westerham were so helpful and always on hand to answer any questions. On the day, the team had everything under control and the whole day went smoothly - not to mention the incredible views!"
V329,Westerham Golf Club,"We honestly cannot recommend Westerham Golf Club enough as a wedding venue! From the moment we first reached out to inquire, the team made everything so easy and stress-free. The events manager and the coordinating team were absolute professionals, and they went above and beyond to ensure that our big day was flawless.

Everything about the day was incredibly well-organised. From the ceremony to the reception, everything flowed so seamlessly. We didn’t have to worry about a single thing as the team had every detail covered. It was amazing to be able to relax and enjoy the moment, knowing that the entire team had everything under control.

The venue itself is absolutely stunning, with beautiful views and a warm, welcoming atmosphere. The level of care and attention the staff gave us was exceptional. The events manager was always there to offer support and guidance, and they were just so kind and approachable. The entire team worked in perfect harmony, and their professionalism shone through at every step.

Our guests had an unforgettable time, and I’m so grateful to the team at Westerham Golf Club for making our wedding day so memorable. If you’re looking for a wedding venue that offers top-tier service, incredible organisation, and a beautiful setting, Westerham Golf Club is the perfect choice!"
V329,Westerham Golf Club,"We visited many venues before deciding on Westerham. What stood out right away was how lovely and welcoming the staff were on that initial visit, they really made us feel like no question was too silly to ask. And of course the setting - we initially wanted an outdoors wedding but knew that there'd be the risk of bad weather, so it was important any outdoor venue would have a great indoor backup. With Westerham, you can't have an outdoor wedding, but the indoor setting, with wide open windows revealing the beautiful landscaped golf course in all directions, meant it was like an outdoor wedding anyway. And it was just as well because on the actual wedding day, there were quite high winds! The team there were so helpful and patient throughout the whole year of planning, and on the day itself. They really put our minds at ease and were really flexible with some of our requests. The reception rooms are great - the smaller one for the ceremony was just the perfect size for our 100 guests, and the larger room for the wedding breakfast and evening celebration was spacious with room to eat, to dance, and to sit to catch your breath. The golf course is a wonderful setting to go out and get your formal photos and some video shot. It's fun to take some of the golf carts up into the wooded area and a chance to have some private moments with your new spouse. It's such a beautiful setting, we would recommend if you can afford it to include some drone footage, for your wedding video because it allows such a great view of the course, the buildings and water features. The food was excellent, in particular the lamb shank, and such huge portions that we struggled to eat a lot later in the evening at the buffet supper. Well worth paying the small extra supplement to allow 2 menu choices plus a veggie/vegan option. They also managed a few tricky dietary requirements really well including Halal and some fairly unique food allergies. Our formal proceedings were capped off by a fireworks display out on the golf course which made for some amazing pictures and video and if you can afford it, we would recommend it. Many guests said it was their favourite part of the evening and a real surprise. We couldn't be happier with our decision to be married here and it's hard now to imagine us getting married at any of the other venues we looked at. You will have a wonderful day no matter what time of year or whatever your theme."
V329,Westerham Golf Club,Amazing staff and amazing place. Loved every minute of my big day. They put in all the effort in to your big day. They made sure the day was perfect
V329,Westerham Golf Club,"Amazing experience from start to finish!
Fell in love with the venue the day we went and viewed it! It was all we imagined!
Gracie was Amazing the whole way through until the big day for us!
I honestly wish I could relive the day!

The day from start to finish is all we ever dreamed off! And I couldn’t recommend this venue enough and the team!"
V329,Westerham Golf Club,"When we began our wedding venue search, our main criteria were:

- good proximity to airport for international guests
- ceremony and reception at the same place, without the need to exit / reset
- no preferred supplier limitations
- kitchen on site (no need to hire externally)
- natural materials, like wood and brick, barn aesthetic
- indoor space we'd be happy not to leave in bad weather
- can have live music with no formal noise limiter
- experienced & supportive team
- budget

Westerham Golf Club delivered all of this and so much more. As soon as we visited the venue for the first time and spoke to the team we were confident we found our venue.

We were assigned a contact person straight away who answered all of our questions by email and phone conversations and was always unbelievably helpful and quick to respond.

In the lead up to the day we met our wedding day coordinators who we were reassured were very on the ball. We had a lot of personal details and touches throughout the day and never felt that we had to remind any of the team about them, they all understood the vision and knew all the intricate details of the day. They delivered them all without fault.

The venue on the day looked absolutely stunning. The exposed brick and beams in the Valence Suite make this feel like a cozy but expansive barn conversion, but with the benefit of the adjoining rooms, wrap around balcony and excellent facilities of the golf club. The views are spectacular and the tree-lined drive up to the venue really sets a great tone.

Throughout the day everything ran like clockwork, guests commented that the food was incredible and all of our suppliers worked with ease with the staff and facilities.

The team set up all our personal and homemade things for us and packed them all away again for easy collection the next morning - we are so so grateful for this!

The flow of the space is fantastic, we had our ceremony in the Eleanor Suite, then did confetti outside before re-entering the main space where the drinks reception were laid out and musicians performing. The bar area, sofas, dance floor and balcony were perfect for the canapes and drinks reception. We had photos on the grounds as well as in the lovely rose garden at the front of the venue. The dinner set up was there from the morning and had a real wow factor when guests first saw it. While Eleanor Suite was empty the chairs were quickly cleared and this became a breakout space where we laid out board games and guests could relax if they didn't want to be dancing with the band.

We got married in November and had a lot of evening guests, so having a space with plenty of room, without anyone needing to go outside (in case of cold/rain) was key and the venue was perfect in this regard. In the end we had a lovely clear day and guests really enjoyed being on the balcony.

I hope this review is helpful in helping other couples choose their venue. For us it was a dream come true and we cannot thank the team enough for delivering a perfect day!"
V329,Westerham Golf Club,"The lead up the wedding was great, Ella helped us with any little questions and made sure everything was sorted!

The day before we met the on the day manager Brad who talked us through the whole day and made sure we were happy with everything. Also when we walked in one of our suppliers hadn’t done what they were meant to - and the venue got on the phone to them right away to come back and sort it meaning the stress was off me!

The day came and it was a blur, but everything went smoothly, my guests couldn’t stop complimenting the venue and how gorgeous it was. Every detail was perfect and the food was amazing! The wine choices were a big hit and I couldn’t be more complimentary of the staff.

The only hiccup we had was when asking for a cup of tea for my Nan during the welcome drinks, and my brother was told they can’t do that by the bar, but my groom went up and it was sorted quickly.

Thanks westerham for a memorable day - that we will cherish always"
V329,Westerham Golf Club,"Westerham is a beautiful venue. The backdrop of the luscious green golf course and the building itself is amazing. The rose garden is the perfect place for a drinks reception - even the drive into the venue is cool!

Now to come onto the staff. Every single one of them couldn’t do enough for us. The communication at every step was faultless, and they are extremely helpful regardless of who you deal with! They are professional and can accommodate a whole variety of things, for example we asked for halal meat and they sourced it without any issue, no extra costs or anything. Their recommended suppliers are great, and they really make you feel at ease throughout the whole process and on the day.

The food is also VERY good. All of our guests were complimentary of that, as well as the decoration and table layout which is rustic and picturesque.

Having the licensed ceremony room in the same venue was perfect, as your guests can simply walk through the door into the wedding breakfast and evening reception room! The bar is well stocked, the wine selection was well received by our guests too.

We really can’t recommend Westerham enough. A few of my friends who were there are now considering it for their wedding venue, it’s that good and I found beat all others on price too!"
V329,Westerham Golf Club,"We made the best decision choosing Westerham Golf Club for our wedding venue. The staff went above and beyond, there are so many photo opportunities on the immaculately kept grounds, and the food was stunning! We had so many compliments from guests on what a fantastic venue we had chosen. The team made the whole wedding planning experience really straight forward, and were always in hand to answer any questions we had. Couldn’t recommend Westerham Golf Club enough!"
V330,The Old Kent Barn,"I could not be happier than we chose to have our wedding at The Old Kent Barn. The care and attention to detail the entire team put into everything they do is unmatched. The venue is absolutely stunning, and so many of our guests commented on how incredible it was. The food was amazing - so filling, tasted amazing and looked just as good. We had Sam as our wedding coordinator and she went above and beyond to ensure we had the best day of our lives. I'm so grateful that we found this venue - as it provided us with the most unforgettable day. Thank you TOKB!"
V330,The Old Kent Barn,"We had our wedding at The Old Kent Barn and couldn’t be happier with our experience. Everything was incredibly well planned and organised from start to finish. The staff were professional, attentive, and genuinely cared about making our day perfect. The venue itself is stunning, with beautiful grounds and a warm, welcoming atmosphere. It made for the most amazing setting for our ceremony and reception. We felt completely supported throughout the planning process and on the day itself. Highly recommend to any couple looking for a seamless and unforgettable wedding experience."
V330,The Old Kent Barn,"We would just like to give a huge heart felt thank you to all of the team at The Old Kent Barn.

We had our special day on a sun filled day on 3rd January 2025 surrounded by all our family and loved ones.
Our wedding was brought forward with 6 months due to doctors advice to my wife.

They couldn’t of been more helpful. Helped us through every step of the way and guided us through the entire process.

This was an absolute god send to my wife who is regularly in and out of Kings College Hospital.
The team took all the stress and worry from us and were always on hand in with any questions.
They were absolutely awesome. They are extremely well organised and ensured everything went well.

Our fairy tale wedding became a reality and we owe this to all the team.

We’d like to give an extra special shout out to Chloe, our wedding co-ordinator. You were awesome!
If anyone is looking for a venue for their special day then look no further than The Old Kent Barn.

You made our fairy tale wedding a reality and we’ll be forever grateful to you all."
V330,The Old Kent Barn,Myself and my husband married at the stunning Old Kent Barn in October and had the best day of our lives. The staff were amazing throughout the whole process from securing a date all the way to end day after the big day. Our wedding coordinator in particular Claire was just amazing and so helpful and resourceful. We would highly recommend the venue to anyone!
V330,The Old Kent Barn,"We got married at TOKB and it was flawless from the very first moment we’ve signed to the wedding day itself.

The whole process was very smooth and they have thought about every little detail. Their portal is very comprehensive and they help you to plan your wedding and make sure you cover every aspect of your day.

They really do go above and beyond and they run the wedding almost military style (in a good way!). They make sure you are on track without being pushy. Everything is done seamlessly and in the background. You never know they are there!

The venue is fantastic and there’s very little you need to do to decorate. It’s just down to individual themes and table decorations. It allows you to take great photos as the venue and the gardens are beautiful.

The food was great. The portions were massive and it tasted great. You won’t be leaving the wedding being hungry.

All in all, they have thought about everything, including the tiniest details. Even at the end of the night, the have made sure that there was some evening food left for us in our bedroom.

We’ve had a great wedding at TOKB and we are very grateful to the venue and the staff for making it perfect."
V330,The Old Kent Barn,"I would recommend TOKB to every single couple out there! They are more than just a venue - the staff here cater to you as if you are family, and gave us the wedding day of our dreams! Each staff member goes above and beyond to ensure your day is perfect, and you get a wedding coordinator who basically ensures everything on the day goes smoothly. They took all the burden of the stress so my partner and I could just be present and enjoy our day. I’m so glad we chose the Old Kent Barn, as my partner and I know not every venue is as thorough and caring as them (from stories from our friends and family about their weddings). Thank you TOKB - we love you!!"
V330,The Old Kent Barn,We chose TOKB as our wedding venue and never once regretted our decision. They have been incredibly supportive through our plethora of questions and thoroughly looked after us from enquiry and beyond the big day. Every single member of staff works extremely hard - from grounds keepers to kitchen staff to bar staff to wedding coordinators - you name it! Nothing is too much trouble for anyone there as they purely want you to have the most special experience with them. I cannot recommend them enough!
V330,The Old Kent Barn,"The Old Kent Barn was the most perfect venue! From the moment my now husband and I went for our first viewing right through until after the wedding the staff at the venue have been amazing - Ashleigh was our wedding coordinator and could not have been more helpful and on the day she was an absolute star and went well beyond her role in helping do things to ensure the day ran smoothly. The venue is STUNNING and the staff set everything up for you so that you can have the most relaxed wedding morning! Our guests could not speak more highly of the food - it was delicious and the chefs team were really accommodating with special requests and dietary needs and allergies etc! My husband and I had the most special wedding day and I highly recommend The Old Kent Barn, you will not regret choosing this as your wedding venue!"
V330,The Old Kent Barn,"We got married at the Old Kent Barn this week. From the minute we first enquired, to the tour, booking, planning, and wedding day were all perfect and so well organized. The staff all go above and beyond and we could not have been any happier. They make the planning process so easy, and we're always there is we needed assistance. The venue is gorgeous, so well maintained, the gardens especially are always being worked on and are gorgeous, we especially loved the pond and ducks!! I would not have changed a thing. The food was brilliant we went for a BBQ and had SO many compliments from our guests, the canapes, deserts and evening food were all amazing as well. Thank you so much for making our day perfect."
V330,The Old Kent Barn,"A week on from our wedding and I’ve come to the conclusion that there are no sufficient words to describe our experience at the barn.
From the minute we booked, the team have been brilliant. They are so responsive, they never leave you waiting for an answer when you email. They are positive, supportive and, most importantly, kind!

I have listened to the podcast ‘The Unfiltered Bride’ for most of the wedding planning and they encourage booking a ‘day of’ coordinator as wedding venues don’t provide the support you need. I can promise, with all my heart, you do not need one at TOKB. I had worried that we’d made a mistake not booking one, but boy did they prove me wrong.
They had at least two people checking on us throughout the morning as well as someone else for my husband, who helped with ties and getting them ready. Yes they were there to coordinate everything from the venue POV, but I did not feel ignored or that I was missing an extra person to help. They were on hand to help get me into my dress, to make sure my bridesmaids were ready. If you listen specifically to episode 74 of ‘The Unfiltered Bride’, everything listed during that episode as something a ‘day of’ coordinator does, is everything the team at TOKB did.

The food at TOKB is sublime. We had the hog roast for wedding breakfast and pizza for the evening. Our guests loved everything about it all, including the canapés. They took all dietary requirements we had in their stride and no-one went hungry.

I could gush about them for hours, they really are excellent."
V331,Leez Priory,"I never in my life thought I would get married in a place like Leez priory! The whole experience from start to finish was just fantastic. The price breakdown was manageable and there was no pressure to take any upgrades offered. The things we got in our package were phenomenal and having a wedding planner was tremendous - our lady (Leanne) was an absolute god send!
They catered to all our needs and we were made to feel so comfortable and nothing was a problem! I’d highly suggest going to an event there before hand, just to get a feel of what it’s like full of people and enjoy their delicious food. We actually enjoyed their entertainer ( singer) so much we hired him for our wedding ☺️
Lee priory is just so beautiful. I can’t speak highly enough x"
V331,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory on the 7th of September 2024. Considering how long they have been a wedding venue, they were pretty flexible with some of the ideas we had for the venue styling that turned out amazingly!

The staff really made the day something special and couldn't have done enough for us. Special mention must be made for Leanne, our wedding planner, who was amazing!

Highly recommend the venue and the incredible team that helped to make our day so special!"
V331,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in October 2024. This venue is stunning both inside and out with immaculately kept grounds and interior. The hospitality in the lead up to and on the day of the wedding was fantastic. The food was also brilliant. Another great perk of this venue is the amount of on site accommodation.

A couple of drawbacks / experiences during our wedding. There are only a few toilets in the main building which kept blocking and overflowing throughout the evening which led to us taking some guests to the dressing room or honeymoon cottage to use the facilities. You are also restricted by the venue on any external food or drink suppliers and the venues optional extras for this are quite expensive for what they are.

That asaide, we had the best day and evening at Leez Priory and would certainly recommend it!"
V331,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in August 2024- great venue and experience from initial viewing to leaving the morning after the wedding. Leanne acted as our wedding planner and was friendly, professional and helpful throughout. We opted for the classic package and the food was amazing quality with everyone commenting how full they were!
The venue is beautiful with several options for ceremony both inside and out. Accommodation was great too. The whole day ran smoothly with perfect weather - we will have very happy memories of our day!"
V331,Leez Priory,"Perfect venue and very attentive staff, lovely food and great communication from start to finish"
V331,Leez Priory,"Stunning venue. Fantastic Team. Very accommodating toward our unique ""surprise"" strategy. Our guests were truly surprised. Thank you."
V331,Leez Priory,"Leez priory was the 1st and only venue we looked around when we started planning our wedding. From the moment we stepped on the premises, everything just looked so perfect and exactly what we wanted from a wedding venue. When we got assigned our wedding co-ordinator Rachel, she was just absolutely spot on with everything we asked for and nothing was too big an ask for her. She made sure the day ran as smoothly as possible and took care of any issue that arose without me knowing (which I am forever grateful for!!)
The rest of the staff were amazing and very helpful.

The venue itself is just absolutely stunning and we loved that it has the pub area as well as the dance floor so it catered to all of our guests.

All of the rooms were lovely and it was so nice being able to stay in the fisherman’s lodge onsite the night before the wedding.

We genuinely cannot recommend this venue enough and it was 100% worth the money! 10/10!"
V331,Leez Priory,"We got married on a Tuesday in October to maximise the value of what we could get for our money; and honestly, we got everything we wanted and more. Leanne, our Wedding Manager was perfect at bringing an attention to detail and seamless organisation to the big day, and in the lead up. There wasn't one moment of the day where we felt stressed, as Leanne had it covered. In one particular instance, our flowers for the bridal party's hair hadn't arrived. Within five minutes of telling Leanne that we needed this, the flowers were with our hair and make-up suppliers to add the finishing touches.

Leez Priory as a venue is the most stunning setting, and offers an incredible range of areas in which the ceremony and reception can take place. There is also the opportunity for the bridal party to make use of the Fisherman's Cottage the night before the wedding, and for people to stay in the on-site accommodation on the evening of the wedding, making it the perfect venue for people also travelling from further afield.

Leez Priory were very accommodating, welcoming and were happy to work with us to make our day as perfect as possible. The food was incredible, and a total hit with all of our guests, and so many people have commented on how incredible the day was as a whole. You wouldn't be disappointed to choose Leez Priory."
V331,Leez Priory,They catered to our every need. To when we would ask for things they hadn’t been done before they still made sure it went smoothly. Leanne was amazing she made me feel so comfortable from the start. The whole day was stunning. Beautiful venue please go view it as you will not be disappointed
V331,Leez Priory,We got married on the 26 May 2024. This venue was absolutely brilliant! They catered for every need and made sure there was no stress on the day. Leanne was kind and level headed throughout and was always one step ahead! Do not hesitate to book- do it now!
V332,Chilston Park,"It’s taken me a while to write this review because it’s hard to put into words how magical my experience with Chilston Park has been. We originally came to Chilston on a whim knowing they had a wedding fair on. The drive up to the hotel is stunning, we were then greeted by Jane, the loveliest and most helpful bundle of joy, Jane became our wedding co ordinator and held my hand every step of the way, we went to every wedding fair from booking last February until our wedding day New Year’s Eve just gone and every time the staff made us feel like family that was visiting. On our day, unfortunately, Jane couldn’t be there but I knew the whole wedding team by then and had no worries that the day would go swimmingly with the amazing Ella, nothing was too much, nothing was answered with no and potential issues were resolved by the time I heard about them. Ella went above and beyond to ensure our day was flawless. Matt, another wonderful human who made it his business to make sure all guests were fed and watered, completed tasks that arose with the biggest smile and again nothing was too much to ask. Multiple guests commented on the efficiency of the staff and great attitudes. We have since been to a sister hotel of Chilston and it really goes to show that everyone can have the same training but the staff truly make a hotel, Chilston is second to none. The venue speaks for itself but these words are for the team because everyone bounced into work, got excited to see us and made us feel like royalty. Paul is clearly a great manager to his team, an absolute asset to Handpicked hotels and a lovely smiley face who even came in on his day off and wished us well. If you’re reading this and looking for a venue, book it, you won’t regret it! We had exclusive use which was great value for money for what it included. The best experience, the best team and the most beautiful venue x"
V332,Chilston Park,"We were so pleased to have had our wedding at Chilston. As soon as we saw the venue, it felt right for us. Its a beautiful venue inside and out. The staff are all excellently trained. From the reception staff, through to the waiting team, through to our wedding coordinator - everyone we met was excellent. We got married off site at a church and were delayed getting back to start our reception at Chilston, but the team were so flexible and made it seem no bother at all. We had such a wonderful day and are looking at being able to go back and stay and Chilston for our anniversary!"
V332,Chilston Park,"We couldn't have asked for more with our wedding at Chilston Park. From the initial booking to the details meeting and then finally the wedding day, everything was pretty much seamless. The wedding day itself went like clockwork and the staff worked so hard to make sure that everything was in place and everyone was in the right place at the right time! All of our guests loved the setting, the food and thought the staff were wonderful. We had a truly wonderful wedding day and that was thanks to the team at Chilston Park/"
V332,Chilston Park,"We viewed lots of potential wedding venues but from the moment we arrived at Chilston Park we just knew it was the place we wanted to hold our wedding. Chloe Rees guided us through the different room options of where we could hold our wedding ceremony as well as have our reception, no question went unanswered and the hotel was very accommodating in helping us deliver our two day dream wedding. Chloe, Paul The Manager and all the staff were fantastic from the start and on the wedding day. Chef, Ali delivered exquisite food for us and our guests, with friends and family still praising it months after. We have been back a few times for afternoon tea and evening meals with all the staff greeting us with such warmth. We have no hesitation in recommending the Chilston Park wedding team and this stunning country setting."
V332,Chilston Park,"Olly and I just wanted to extend our thanks to everyone at Chilton Park for making our wedding on Friday 7th of March 2025 it was so incredible.


Sophie was the first person we spoke to and she made the booking process seamless. She was so helpful in ensuring everything was arranged before her holiday and we are incredibly grateful for her.

The day before the wedding, I had the pleasure of meeting Ella and Ellie, who went above and beyond to assist us. They were both attending our wedding and were genuinely amazing. Ella made our day so special—she took care of everything from cutting the cake to moving things around, so we didn’t have to worry about a thing. She was truly outstanding. Ellie, working behind the bar, was equally fantastic, always with a smile on her face and everyone absolutely adored her.

We can’t thank them enough for making our day unforgettable. Even the morning after the wedding, when we came down for breakfast, Ella was there to greet us with a big smile and get everything ready for us.

Olly and I are already looking forward to returning to Chilton Park when our little one arrives. What a wonderful way to start March!

Thank you again to everyone at Chilton Park, and we hope to see you all again soon.

Best wishes,

The Yeomans!"
V332,Chilston Park,"We got married at Chilston Park in August, and it was nothing short of perfection. We opted for the exclusive use package, which catered to every need. Most of our guest list were international guests, and being able to host everyone comfortably under one roof for the full weekend was incredible. From the food to the helpful staff and gorgeous grounds, I highly recommend choosing Chilston Park for your wedding if you are looking for English elegance. Thank you to the full team who made our dream wedding weekend possible! Big shout out to Sophie for helping us plan for over a year and a half!"
V332,Chilston Park,"We honestly couldn't have wished for any more.
The professionalism and attention to detail was immaculate.
Even though we were a small wedding we were never made to feel less than anyone else."
V332,Chilston Park,"We have just had our special day, and all I can say is from the moment we looked around to the day after the wedding we was well looked after, we had a designated person to speak about our wedding and all our needs were met with no questions asked. The venue and the grounds are stunning, the bedrooms are beautiful and our day was so perfect, I couldn’t fault anything. I just wish we could do it all over again. I would highly recommend Chilston Park as a wedding venue."
V332,Chilston Park,"If you are considering Chilston Park Hotel for your wedding venue let me put your mind at ease.

We got married in Chilston park hotel on the 14th January 2024 and it was the best day of our lives. All our guests are still messaging and calling us telling us what a fantastic time they had, how beautiful the ceremony and the venue are, how through the day they were never hungry and that the food really was amazing.

Although the venue may be second to none it was the staff for me who really make this venue special, the attention to detail is exceptional. From the moment we attended the venue for an open day Jane our event organiser was amazing, Jane always made time to speak to us and communication was always very prompt and very accommodating where she could be. Jane really made the whole process very easy and stress free even with only having a year to plan it all.

On the day of the wedding the team at the venue were nothing short of exceptional. Matt was our point of contact on the day I approached Matt early that morning with a few tasks and like a mind reader had assured me everything had already been taken care of. The day ran faultlessly, it became clear from the beginning of the day that the staff have it down to a fine art which allowed us to just enjoy the day.

I cannot commend or recommend this venue highly enough, thank you again to Jane and Matt and all the staff at Chilston Park Hotel for the day of our lives."
V332,Chilston Park,"Excellent service, made our wedding day a really special memory. Beautiful food, always willing to help us with advice and effort throughout our day. Would recommend for no fuss professional and enjoyable day."
V333,Eastwell Manor,"My husband and I got married at Eastwell Manor in October 2024, and it was everything we dreamed of and more. From the moment we arrived, we were swept away by the breathtaking grounds, the elegant manor, and the warm, welcoming staff who made us feel like royalty.

The entire day was simply magical. The ceremony setting was so romantic – full of charm and character – and the reception felt like something out of a dream. Every detail was perfectly taken care of, and we didn’t have to worry about a thing. The staff were so friendly and helpful, and they truly went above and beyond to make sure everything ran smoothly.

We can't thank the Eastwell Manor team enough for making our wedding so unforgettable. If you’re thinking about getting married here – do it! It’s the most magical, romantic, and beautiful venue you could ask for.

With all our love,
Mr & Mrs Clarke 💕✨"
V333,Eastwell Manor,"My husband and I married here in April 2024. The venue was stunning and guests were impressed with their rooms. The toast master Jim is highly recommended. He really brought the energy into the wedding.
Highly recommended."
V333,Eastwell Manor,"We got married in August 2024 and we had the most stress-free and beautiful wedding. It was raining on the day and our Plan A was for the ceremony to be outside, but on the day it had to be changed to Plan B. The Eastwell Manor team handled the change of plans with such ease, I didn't have to worry about a thing and the end result was better than our original plan! The wedding coordinators at Eastwell Manor are incredibly organised and professional. Jim, the Toastmaster, is an absolute delight and really brought the crowd together. The food was excellent and the tent outside was beautiful at night. We had a beautiful day and are eternally grateful to the team at Eastwell manor for looking after us so well. The rooms are stunning to stay in and the bridal suite is absolutely gorgeous to get ready in with your bridesmaids."
V333,Eastwell Manor,"We would like to say a massive Thankyou to Eastwell and their fantastic team which made our wedding day truly special and unforgettable!
From the first visit we knew Eastwell was the perfect venue for us, from the great layout of the venue to its fantastic facilities, beautiful rooms and ceremony spaces.
The wedding team were all amazing, professional and so friendly and nothing was too much trouble.
Everything organised quickly yand efficiently through email and were always very accommodating and flexible.
We really appreciate everybody’s hard work which made our day the best of our lives!"
V333,Eastwell Manor,"After getting engaged on my 40th birthday, we decided we wanted a Christmas wedding and wanted to plan it within a year. We had Eastwell Manor as one of our venue choices and after viewing it in December 23 (when it was decorated for Xmas) we completely knew it was ‘the one!’. Throughout the year of planning, Dawn and Helen were amazing. Responded to emails etc quickly, helped wherever needed, and it was lovely to have a menu tasting session in a private room. I stayed in the bridal suite the night before. A few of us had dinner in the bar which was very relaxing. The room/suite was beautiful. The bath was amazing (see photos) and I had a lovely morning getting ready for the day ahead. Our wedding was so special. To be surrounded by our guests in such a fabulous venue so beautifully decorated for Christmas, it was magical. Everyone said how great it was. The food taste delicious and was presented well. All the staff were so friendly and helpful. My husband and I stayed in the bridal suite that night and it was just great. I would 100% recommend this venue. Id also recommend a Christmas wedding as the atmosphere is something else. Thanks again Eastwell Manor, Dawn and the team, you are amazing 🤩 Love Mr & Mrs Smith (22.12.24) 🎄 xx"
V333,Eastwell Manor,"We got married at Eastwell Manor in May and honestly, it was the perfect day from start to finish! The venue is absolutely stunning — the grounds, the house, everything just felt like a fairytale. The staff were incredible and made us feel so relaxed and looked after the entire time. They really went above and beyond to make sure everything ran smoothly. The food was amazing, the setup was beautiful, and all our guests were raving about the whole experience. We couldn’t have picked a better place to say “I do”. Massive thanks to everyone at Eastwell Manor — you helped make our day so special and we’ll treasure it forever!"
V333,Eastwell Manor,"We visited Eastwell Manor when looking for venues and instantly fell in love with it. The grounds are so impressive and the inside very homely and comfortable. The wedding team are extremely helpful and professional and helped make our day perfect. The rooms are all lovely, particularly in the manor house and all guests were very happy with them. Particular thanks to Helen, Dawn, Tracey and Chris for the lead up to our big day and for coordinating our day so well without any issues. The food tasting was amazing and had a real personal touch and the food was very well executed on the day with no delays and again our guests have been saying how much they enjoyed it. Our toastmaster Jim was fantastic and also ensured our day went perfectly. Thank you to all of those behind the scenes in the kitchen and the efficient staff who assisted with the wedding breakfast and bar in the evening. Would highly recommend this venue."
V333,Eastwell Manor,"Really lovely venue, the whole day went really smoothly and big thanks to Jim who did an amazing job MCing and corralling the crowd when needed. Really made the day run smoothly, everyone had an awesome time."
V333,Eastwell Manor,"After postponing our wedding and even losing our original venue due to Covid, we knew that finding an alternative that we loved just as much was going to be tough. Eastwell Manor is every bit as beautiful as the photos suggest, and after visiting, we knew we’d found the perfect place for us immediately.
The Maid’s Garden fit our dreams of an outdoor ceremony perfectly with its ivy-lined walls, manicured lawns, pond and Italian gazebo. The terrace with its views overlooking the endless grounds was the ideal space for our reception drinks and canapés, especially on a blue-skied day in June. The wood-panelled Rose Garden Room made the perfect setting for an intimate wedding breakfast with 80 of our closest friends and family. The room was transformed for the evening reception with fairy lights (put up very kindly, and at short notice, by the venue staff) candles and a DJ, with the neighbouring Chaucer Room serving as our bar and a slightly more relaxed setting for our guests. During the evening we also held a barbecue on the terrace as the sun went down with plenty of food for everyone to enjoy.
It’s worth adding that with so much accommodation available in the Manor House and Mews, it really had the feel of a destination wedding. Friends and family were able to stay on-site for a long weekend, giving us the chance to celebrate with them the night before and all enjoy the fabulous spa facilities the day after.
We can’t emphasise enough that all of this was made possible by the outstanding team at Eastwell Manor, who literally could not have done anything more to ensure that we had the best day of our lives. They really did go above and beyond and made us both feel as if the entire hotel was our home for the day. This extends far beyond the exceptional wedding and events team. From the bar and waiting staff always happy and willing to help, to the reception staff that were on-hand at all hours and the incredible chefs that served the best wedding food we have ever had (our guests still talk about the beef!). Helen and Jasmine were a dream to work with, being flexible with all of our requests and doing everything they could to make sure that all of our ideas were realised on the day. A special mention has to go to Chris - an absolute asset to the Eastwell team, he worked tirelessly to ensure everything went without a hitch on the day, and all while looking cool, calm and collected. You really are in excellent hands with this team!
We cannot thank the whole team at Eastwell Manor enough, they gave us our dream wedding day and we wholeheartedly recommend them to everyone!

V333,Eastwell Manor,"We had the best day! The team are amazing and can’t do enough to help. A special thank you to Helen for all of your help to plan our big day, Chris for all of your hard work on the day and Jim, the toastmaster, who was absolutely brilliant and looked after all of our guests. Harry and Olex also looked after us throughout our stay.
Everything went like clockwork from start to finish, with wonderful food and great rooms.
We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this beautiful venue."
V334,The Barn,"I can not recommened this venue enough! From start to end they have been so helpful and accommodating. Phillippe & Janet made our day so special, we wouldnt have changed a thing. The staff were wonderful, they decorated the venue better than we could have imagined, the food was delicious, the DJ was amazing and all our guests commented on all of these things and more. The venue is perfect, a little oasis for a cosy, pretty wedding. Enjoyed every momement, all ran smoothly and everyone had the best time!"
V334,The Barn,"A HUGE THANK YOU to all the amazing staff at the barn everyone was truly incredible on the day and everything was even more amazing and special than we ever expected ♥️

The food was truly incredible and delicious all came out hot with food portions HUGE !!

The sticky toffee pudding was insane !!!

All the guests said how amazing everything was and couldn’t believe the amount of choices they had too choose from ☺️

Phillipe did an amazing job of making all our ideas come to life and also Janet thank you soo much for helping with the many emails and phone calls due to such a last minute booking you both did amazing and can truly see that yourselves and your staff love what you do ♥️

If you’re looking for somewhere and unsure if this is the place to book I can assure you, you won’t regret it one bit !!! We also used there in house dj which again thank you very much Luke ☺️

V334,The Barn,"Thank you so much for such an amazing day, food was fabulous, over the moon with how things went"
V334,The Barn,Wow!! As soon as I visited The Barn I knew it was the perfect venue for our wedding and I was right! Our day was absolutely perfect and everything went so smoothly thanks to every one at The Barn! Everyone made you feel so comfortable and nothing was ever too much for them! They set up the venue exactly how I had visioned it and all the guests loved the food! We love going back now for a drink or food and they are always so welcoming still!
V334,The Barn,"Amy & I celebrated our marrage at the barn which couldn't have been better.

The staff were very friendly and extremely organised, going out of their way to make sure everything flowed effortlessly.

This put us both and our guests at ease to enjoy every moment."
V334,The Barn,"I cannot thank everyone at The Barn enough for making our wedding day the best day of our lives. It's hard to put into words how perfect everything was. From start to finish every detail was well thought out, every change of plan and sudden request was catered for and throughout you knew you were in safe hands. The venue is beautiful, staff are incredibly friendly, polite and helpful. Food and drink is amazing. The list goes on and on. All I can say again, is Thank You. Cannot recommend highly enough!"
V334,The Barn,"We recently had our wedding at The Barn and from the moment we contacted Philippe we couldn’t have asked for a better experience. With only 4 months between booking and event it was great that communication and planning with Janet was easy, flexible, timely and supportive – from our plans with various music playlists needed on different sound systems to arranging our rehearsal the day before, all the little details were accommodated.

The location of The Barn is really accessible being in the centre of town, with plenty of places for guests to stay nearby, yet it feels very private as it is set away from the main road down a private street with no passing traffic. It is a gorgeous venue, really intimate but with plenty of space for our 70 guests, and the team had done an excellent job of setting up and laying out our table decorations beautifully; it was a wonderful space for us to connect with our guests.

All the staff were professional, friendly and helpful throughout the event; many of our guests commented on how lovely they were, along with how fantastic the venue was.

The food was delicious, guests choose from 4 meals on each course, and every one of them looked amazing, we’ve heard many compliments of every option. Service throughout the meal was excellent, a good level of attentive, efficient and unobtrusive, they served a large room at a good pace.

The whole running of the day was done smoothly, changing areas worked really well, we hardly noticed the hard work going on downstairs while we had our meal.

We can’t thank the team at The Barn enough for helping us have such a wonderful day and we highly recommend this wonderful venue!"
V334,The Barn,"There’s no words to describe the barn or their team. If you haven’t already booked a wedding with them, do it, and don’t think twice!

Philippe and Janet are amazing, from our initial emails and queries, through to the booking and the meeting to discuss our options etc. We were presented with a lovely folder containing all of the information, and some sample menus - given plenty of choices to give to guests (allowed up to 4 of each for adults, and 2 of each for children - loads more flexibility than a lot of other venues)

We dropped off our decorations the day before, and it’s lovely to see local businesses working together to support each other and the area (they supply discount codes for local hotels), and the Hotel were happy for us to leave a car in the car park overnight before.

When I arrived at the venue, the team had decorated it just how we wanted it, with all of our name places out, activity packs, favours etc.

Nothing was too much trouble, we had vegetarians, coeliacs and allergies - all the food was impeccable. Every single person commented on how great their sea bass was, or how tender (and huge!) the rack of lamb was, it’s safe to say they catered for everyone (gluten free ice cream, gluten free bread rolls etc). Even catered for a vegetarian child at short notice !

Their house DJ (Luke Swift) did a great job too, keeping the music flowing and people up on their feet - a real crowd pleaser.

The bar staff, were incredible - smiles all round, enjoying the day as much as we were - making it extra special.

The sweet cart, patisserie selection and cheese tower looked great too (even supplied gluten free crackers for that too)!

Philippe, Janet, Andrew, Jack & Toby (and the rest of the back of house team), thank you so much for making our day so memorable, every single one of our guests said how great they day was, and you’ve even secured a few new restaurant customers (from as far as Greenwich) who are coming back as they want to taste the other food options 😂!!"
V334,The Barn,"We had our wedding here in November & ourselves & all of our guests had the best day. The staff were nothing short of amazing, so attentive & really couldn’t do enough for you. The food was brilliant, everyone said how they enjoyed every course & the evening buffet too! You got to choose out of a big list per course, so you could give your guests 4 options per course to choose from which is very very rare with wedding breakfasts! It really is such a beautiful & intimate venue with exceptional prices. They decorated it perfectly, exactly how we imagined. We dropped 5+ boxes off the night before & a description of how we’d like everything & the staff did it perfectly. Not one thing was wrong. We had outside suppliers for a couple of decor/sweet Cart items who failed to turn up, I found out as I was about to walk down the aisle so was upset and stressed. The Barn staff, especially Phillippe, sorted everything and to my surprise in the evening we had a stocked sweet table decorated downstairs for us & our guests, they really do go above & beyond for you. We have no complaints or reservations at all about this venue & would 100% recommend it to everyone. The ceremony room looked so pretty too, with the chairs covered & the pretty twig trees, we didn’t need any more decor in there than that, the orangery is such a pretty room on its own. As is the rest of the venue with gorgeous wooden beams, it can suit all sorts of wedding themes. Thank you to everyone at The Barn for making our special day, the best day ever!"
V334,The Barn,"Patrick and I had our wedding reception at the Barn on the 31st July 2022 and we could not have chosen a more perfect venue for our special day.
On viewing The Barn, we both instantly fell in love with this beautiful venue which is also in such a perfect location in the centre of Tunbridge Wells, so convenient for our guests, many of who would be staying in nearby hotels. Having a smaller wedding, we were also thrilled that we could have the exclusive use of the venue for the whole day which later proved to add to the relaxing atmosphere of the occasion.
Philippe was so friendly and helpful in guiding us with our choices which made everything so much easier and ensured all ran smoothly on the day.
Throughout the process, Janet was amazing too and always answered my questions promptly, nothing was too much trouble.
Like many couples who get married here, we had our photos taken in Calverley park, which is just across the road from the venue, again so convenient as we did not have to leave our guests for too long.
The food was delicious, and we had many compliments, it was also wonderful to be able to offer our guests individual menus from the various choices available, a feature I would not have previously thought was possible. The welcome canapes and the evening buffet were also very well received.
Luke Swift, the resident DJ, was great too and kept the dancers on their feet.
We are so pleased that we chose The Barn for our wedding and can not recommend this venue highly enough. We thoroughly enjoyed the day and all our guests had a fabulous time.
Dear Janet and Philippe, we so appreciate everything you did to make our day so special and one that we will always remember.
Thank you so much,
Christine & Patrick x"
V335,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","The best choice we made was having our wedding at the oak barn frame farm! Not only is the space gorgeous, but it's eco friendly, has lots of different options depending on preference and weather, and they have beautiful cottages for family and close friends to stay close and the option to spend the whole weekend at the farm! It was exactly what we were looking for! And the best part was the support! Chrystelle was amazing!! She helped us through the whole planning process and gave us the invaluable list of suppliers( who were all amazing!). She is such a professional and a wonderful person! She really went above and beyond making sure we had the best day (weekend) of our lives! Couldn't recommend this place more! If you're looking for a country wedding, you've found your place!"
V335,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","We had our wedding in October 2024 at the Oak Barn Frame Farm and we couldn’t have picked a more perfect venue! From the moment we looked around the barn, we both knew it was the place for us. Having 3 barns meant we were able to keep our 50 guests entertained and still have beautiful spaces. We weren’t sure what to expect with dry-hire, but the barn is so beautiful it could be kept minimal if you’re on a budget, but being able to personalise it to how we wanted it made it extra special for us. The open fields, waterfall and sheep meant we got some amazing photos (from our photographer Matt Birchall) as well as the best memories. Chrystelle couldn’t have been more helpful, from her communication in planning, to the materials provided in the run up to the wedding, and her excellent organisation on the day meaning our wedding ran seamlessly and we didn’t have to worry about anything. The list of trusted suppliers was great too, and we used quite a few who were also great. The accommodation on site was an added bonus for us and family, and all of our friends and family commented on what a perfect venue we’d chosen. Being environmentally focused was also a huge bonus for us, as it really aligned with our values. Thank you to all at the Oak Barn for giving us the happiest day!"
V335,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","It was an absolute joy to have our wedding at the oak barn - we had the most perfect day! The team were so responsive and helpful throughout the process - we loved working with Hayley and Chrystelle!

The spaces were all beautiful and a perfect balance of indoor and outdoor in case of rain! We had so many compliments on the venue throughout the day.

We loved how much we were able to personalise the venue - from setting up the wedding breakfast decorations from scratch to bottling up our own homemade cocktails to serve throughout the day. The onsite accommodation was spotless and felt so luxurious. It was fab for all our nearest and dearest to be so close and turned it from a day to a weekend of celebrations! Thank you so much to the oak barn for making it all so special!"
V335,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","We recently had our wedding at The Oak Barn and it was the perfect place. The barn and surroundings are absolutely beautiful, the fact you can spend the whole weekend there really makes the wedding feel special with plenty of time to set up and relax.
The team are amazing, really supportive in the run up and during the weekend and ready to help with whatever might arise!
Thank you for the best weekend ever."
V335,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","I cannot thank Oak Barn enough - you made everything absolutely PERFECT!!!

Thank you for your constant eye to detail, for keeping us in line and for your creative flare.

You managed expertly to make us all so relaxed on every level. Throughout this entire process you have been so diligent, always going the extra mile and always suggesting the most fun ideas - you really made all my dreams come true.

With our greatest thanks,
Chris and Alice"
V335,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","I honestly cannot stress enough how beautiful this venue is and how amazing the staff are. From the day we went to view the venue (and fell in love the second we drive down the drive) to the moment we left the day after our wedding the staff were always on hand for anything we needed. It’s great having the cottages on site as well, being able to stay the night before our wedding and the night of made life so much easier for us meaning we could get everything done the day before the wedding and I didn’t spend the morning stressing if everything was right. This venue is truly stunning and has so many different places for gorgeous photos. Thank you again Tim and Deana for allowing us to get married at your amazing venue. Emma and Elliot"
V335,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","It was great being able to stay from Friday till Sunday which made us all feel way more relaxed than trying to do everything in a day!
The three barns are wonderful each with its own unique charm and thing to offer.
The cottages were beautifully set out and offered us and our wedding party top end accommodation."
V335,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","From the first visit of the Oak Barn, I knew it was where I wanted to get married and it did not disappoint!
The booking process and the final details meeting run so smoothly, all of the staff are extremely helpful throughout they provide you with so much information to make your organising of the wedding so easy!
We booked Oak Barn for two nights along with Weavers Cottages, it was the best thing we did… our guests were able to settle in the day before and we had everyone round for drinks and nibbles the night before making our wedding so much fun! The cottages are so comfortable with every detail thought of… waking up to the sheep in the fields is just perfect!
Chrystelle was the best, she made sure we was happy at all times and made sure everything run so smoothly even appearing during my sons tantrum (toddler) in the middle of the ceremony with cookies to calm him down. After being awake in the middle of the night replanning our ceremony to be outside due to the fact I had both of my brothers giving me away and also how lucky we were with the fantastic weather!
Both members of staff who were there on the evenings to lock up the barns were so helpful and friendly and made it so easy for us!
The Oak Barn really is the most special venue, it is absolutely stunning down to every little touch! The memories we will have from the perfect wedding here will last forever for both us and our guests! Thank you to everyone at Oak Barn for making it so special!"
V335,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","From the moment we drove down the drive for the first time, until approximately six months later when we said I do, we knew this was the venue for us. We were blessed to have unexpectedly beautiful weather for April, the presence of the young lambs adding to the atmosphere and just the perfect day from start to finish.
We hired the venue for the weekend, to enable our wider family and guests to be part of our celebration and it really did take a huge amount of stress out of the actual day. The cottages are welcoming, of a high standard, and provide all that you need, although never did get to experience the copper bath!
The whole team are hugely supportive, encouraging, making you believe that anything is possible. Each wedding feels individual and personal, limited only by your imagination. We would whole heartedly recommend the Oak Barn and its recommended suppliers."
V335,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","We made the ultimate mistake of visiting this venue first when starting to plan our big day - no where else compared.

The views (& sheep!), the beautiful barn & Byre (a choice of indoor or outdoor ceremonies), well furnished cottages for all to stay & just a the perfect feel for a wedding.

They provided a list of recommended suppliers who have worked (& are trusted) at their venue which gave us a great starting point although they were more than accommodating for anyone new.

Very helpful in the run up in the day with compiling a complete run through of the day - with floor layouts, supplier details (& got in contact with each supplier on our behalf to ensure they were equipped with all the info for the day). Even on the day, Tim was great at resolving any small hiccups that appeared.

Huge thank you to Tim, Deana, Chrystelle, Tembo & all the behind the scenes team for making our day so special."

V337,The Vines of Rochester,"We had the most amazing wedding at The Vines! I would 100% recommend this wedding venue. The food, service, running of the day etc was all exceptional. All of our guests commented on how amazing the venue was"
V337,The Vines of Rochester,"We had the most amazing wedding day at The Vines of Rochester. The venue is absolutely beautiful, with so many gorgeous touches throughout.
The staff on the day and the build up were so helpful and accommodating, which meant the day ran so smoothly from start to finish.
We would definitely recommend anyone looking at The Vines as a potential wedding venue - we couldn't have wished for anything more!"
V337,The Vines of Rochester,"Our special day was perfect, and this is credit to the wonderful Vines venue and the amazing team led by Becky and Holly.

The venue is beautiful. So much character and style. We loved getting married in the tippe, very intimate. The dining room did not need a lot of dressing and flowers, some simple styling and the space looked amazing. We loved that there were multiple spaces for our guests to use, the bar area was lively and great for chatting while the dining rooms transformed to a generous dance floor. Then our closest friends and family were able to stay at the venue with us, to enjoy a yummy breakfast the next day.
The location, venue and setting is just perfect.

The whole experience with the Vines team was very professional and well organised. Questions were answered super promptly, with confidence from the super friendly team.
The supper tasting night was great, we were able to sample multiple starters and desserts, although keep an eye out and book early.
The pre wedding appointment went through every detail. There was nothing that they hadn’t considered and care was taken to tailor to our preferences, nothing was a problem.

On the day Becky and Holly were amazing, so attentive, supportive, brilliant ladies, they absolutely made the day with lots of complements from our guests on the high quality of the team. The food was outstanding, thank you to the culinary team.
The DJ was great, tailored to our music preferences and refused any off piste guest requests! Well looked after by the evening team.

We can’t thank you all enough for such a wonderful day."
V337,The Vines of Rochester,"From the initial visit to The Vines, we knew it was the perfect venue for us. The staff team were always on hand to help with any queries or logistical issues we had, answering all of our questions and the online portal was so easy to use. The pricing is clearly laid out and there aren't any hidden or added on costs later on. We mainly dealt with Holly on the lead up to the wedding, and Becky and Will on the day. They were all so helpful and supportive. They took care of a last minute crisis when the lady bringing our dog to be the ring bearer ended up stuck in traffic. Without us even knowing, they sent someone to go and help bring them to the venue on time. Nothing was too much trouble for them. The drinks...good luck deciding what package you want as they are all so delicious. We opted for the festival wedding which was so laid back, but still organised. The food was so good and the evening buffet was lovely. The DJ included liaised with us on the lead up to the wedding and worked with us to put together an idea of what we wanted and what would get people dancing, which worked perfectly. The rooms....there are so many to choose from to be your wedding suite. We opted for a garden room. We gave the others to guests travelling to the wedding and all of the rooms are so beautiful in their own unique way. Becky and Will were on hand all of our wedding day for us and our guests and anything we needed was taken care of without a fuss. The morning after we all had breakfast with our guests that stayed over and that was such a lovely extra touch to add to the wedding. Even the timings that the planners work out mean there are non rushed transitions of moving your items out and the next wedding bringing items in; you barely notice. Being able to store items there a few days before is a huge help! Also in the lead up to the wedding they invited us to a supper evening where we got to enjoy some of the lovely food on offer. In the portal there is also a section for selling and buying wedding items which is very helpful and convenient.
Honestly we couldnt have been happier with our choice of venue and have recommended it to friends that have since gotten engaged. Amazing venue and team x"
V337,The Vines of Rochester,"We instantly fell in love with The Vines, it was the perfect venue for us and we loved having a relaxed festival style wedding meaning we had more time to mingle with our guests. The wedding coordinators were friendly, accommodating and professional. We were in such good hands and were made to feel so special. It really was the best day. Thank you so much, Alex & Tom."
V337,The Vines of Rochester,"We were lucky enough to have held our wedding day at The Vines on 4th November 2023. From start to finish, the whole process was such a breeze. Their communication was always so speedy and thorough (which is what any bride wants). There were never too many small or big questions I could ask them, as they were always so happy to help. It was honestly such a stress free experience for us and they went above and beyond. I cannot thank them enough for everything. The venue, the rooms, the food, the staff… all faultless! We chose the ‘festival’ style wedding to suit us and our guests and we still have guests commenting now on what a fabulous day and experience it was. It was very different from any wedding we had attended, in the best way possible. If my husband would let me do it all again tomorrow, I would!"
V337,The Vines of Rochester,"We had a wonderful day with our friends and family. The venue is beautiful. Such amazing photo opportunities at the venue but also in Rochester with the castle and cathedral. everyone said how lovely it is. All the wedding co-ordinaters were wonderful, any problem or question was always dealt with promptly and professionally. Our venue will always have brilliant memories of our day."
V337,The Vines of Rochester,"We had our wedding here recently and wow what a venue! It’s such a pretty venue and so many of our guests commented on how lovely it is. It has amazing locations for photos, in the sunshine and rain! And we had a mixture of both on our day. But the best thing about the Vines has to be the team that work there. They couldn’t do enough for you. They made everything seem effortless, they were so kind and accommodating and we are so pleased we chose the Vines as our wedding venue. From Becky our duty manager on the day - who was absolutely fabulous and couldn’t have done more for us - to the bar staff, waiting staff, DJ and just everyone we encountered - they were all fabulous. Thank you so much!"
V337,The Vines of Rochester,"Venue is absolutely stunning.
Staff on the day were good & couldn’t do more.
Was sold on the basis we’d have a wedding portal to help us throughout - this is only for a traditional wedding. If having a festival wedding there is nothing.
Personally I felt alone & wasn’t confident until the meeting 8weeks before to go through plans for the day- I felt if anything was not ok it was late to make amendments.
As a second wedding I knew what I wanted but was chilled, however for some this may not be a good experience.

On the day - we had pre arranged a tab with conditions, thus didn’t seem to be adhered too. I had several decorations go missing & I got no response.

We received no contact after the wedding to ask for feedback or to ask if everything was ok"
V338,Solton Manor,"Solton Manor had everything that we dreamed of for our special day. The grounds are just beautiful, the Manor House is full of character and charm and the Dutch Barn definitely has the wow factor.
The team at Solton Manor deserve a special mention. From start to finish, Karen, Jackie and the team were professional, friendly, helpful, extremely hard working and nothing was ever too much trouble. They welcomed our sausage dog, Frankie who was a very important part of our day. A big 'woof' of thanks from him!!
Our guests loved staying in the Manor House and the pretty Dovecote Cottage. The facilities allowed us to make breakfast for our guests the day after which was an added bonus! The games room with a table tennis table was a real hit too!
Highly recommend this fantastic venue!"
V338,Solton Manor,"Our wedding was everything we wanted.
Karen and Jackie were there to help and had lots of ideas to make our dream come true.
We stayed in the Manor House and the Bridal Suite is stunning. The boys used the Games Room to get ready and the girls had the whole Dovecote to themselves.
Food was delicious too!
It was wonderful, thank you so much.
Lena and Christian"
V338,Solton Manor,"Solton Manor was the perfect setting for our special day in October 2023.
Karen and Jackie made us feel at ease and were super responsive with all the planning right from our very first contact.
The day itself was everything that we wanted it to be and would absolutely recommend this venue. Thank you, Abi and Josh"
V338,Solton Manor,"From the moment we arrived at Solton Manor, we knew it was the venue for us. We were met at the door of the historic Manor House and had a fabulous time hearing stories about the house, walking around the gorgeous gardens and visiting the wonderful Dutch Barn - we were already wedding planning!
Our Wedding was such a special weekend and we loved every minute of it.
The venue is magical and you have thought of everything to make it perfect.
Your attention to detail was incredible and your help was so supportive every step of the way.
It was as important to you as it was to us that the day was the day of our dreams and we just cannot believe how perfect it was. Thank you so much for everything. Mandy and Kevin"
V338,Solton Manor,From the booking o the planning to the actual wedding was all so amazing! The team truly went out of their way to make my day the most perfect day ever!
V338,Solton Manor,"From start to finish, the venue were brilliant. Always prompt to respond, ready with help and ideas, flexible and just perfect on our Special Day. What amazing memories we made that day"
V338,Solton Manor,Shelley is so kind and helpful! The venue is stunning and I loved every minute of our wedding day there!
V338,Solton Manor,"We had our wedding in Oct2021 & Solton Manor was the perfect setting for our special day. Shelly handled the whole process from start to finish in such a friendly, helpful & efficient manner. Our wedding was postponed by 1 year due to COVID but Shelly made the whole process stress-free and she was always super responsive. We would thoroughly recommend this wedding venue!"
V339,The Darenth,"Our wedding experience was absolutely perfect! Everything was so well organised, and the staff went above and beyond to accommodate us. Communication throughout the entire process was excellent, making the day completely stress-free. Highly recommended!"
V339,The Darenth,"I cannot recommend the Darenth more. The staff were absolutely incredible, we could not have wanted for more on our day. We were never without a drink, and nothing was too much of an ask. The staff were so friendly to our guests, and really created a relaxed environment. Leading up to the ceremony they made us feel so relaxed and they were very informative. Jason, Kerry, Sarah, Louise and everyone at the Darenth, thank you so much for making our day so special!"
V339,The Darenth,"We found The Darenth when looking for a venue for our twilight wedding. We wanted our wedding to truly reflect us as a couple and where we could be flexible with how the day would go.

When we went to see The Darenth, not only was the venue stunningly beautiful, inside and out, there was a warmth to the place and the team were so friendly and very helpful. From the moment we contacted the team, Lucy was our main contact and couldn’t help us enough. Despite the number of weddings held here, we felt special throughout as if our special day was the main focus for them all. Lucy was great with all the details, understanding what we wanted and offering help and support without pushing anything.

On the day, Jason was amazing at managing the day - making sure we had time to ourselves but that the day ran exactly as we wanted. He was also very supportive and did a great job putting us at ease when we were nervous leading up to the ceremony. The whole team were thoughtful and looked after us all day, making sure we had food and drink and anything else we needed. All our guests commented on how wonderful the staff were and it allowed us to truly focus on enjoying our day. Leigh and Kerry were also fantastic on the day, couldn’t be more helpful.

We had an amazing day, everything went exactly as we hoped and better. A massive part of that was down to The Darenth and their incredible team - we couldn’t recommend highly enough!"
V339,The Darenth,"From the moment you walk into The Darenth we were made to feel comfortable. We were taken on a tour of the venue and booked there and then In October 2022 for September 2023. The staff were knowledgable and professional which is what made us book this venue.

Communication was always good throughout, we visited several times with different family members and the staff were alway welcoming. As an older couple we wanted that relaxed but professional day and this is what we got.

The venue is amazedly clean and beautiful with views of the golf course. We was lucky even to get married outside and the outside area is amazing but the staff make this place and your day the best it could be.

We dealt with Kerrie and Jason mainly but everyone we had dealings with were great. Jason ran the day and he was brilliant, I love a bit of banter and he was excellent and even made it fun when I was so nervous 😊 there was also a lady that run the evening (sorry I can’t remember her name) she was also really good making sure everything was ok and stayed until the last guest left. One thing they did do was made sure the bride and groom kept topped up with drinks all day and night again a nice touch, I didn’t visit the bar once 😀

The food was amazing and everyone commenting on how good the food was. We had 9 children and they even did a 3 course for them with milk or lemonade for the toast which was a lovely little touch and made the children part of the day.

The only thing I would have liked would be to have a dressing room on site for the wedding day rather than travelling from elsewhere but that’s my personal view.

Thank you to everyone involved in our day ❤️"
V339,The Darenth,"We got married at this beautiful venue 11.08.23 and cannot recommend enough!! Everyone commented saying how perfect the day was, and every detail was covered by the amazing staff!! Nothing is ever too much to ask - we want to do it all over again!! Massive thanks especially to Jason, Kirsty & Kerry!! My go to people on the day and leading up to the wedding! But every member of staff were just amazing and on the ball with everything. Thank you from a very happy couple 🤍"
V339,The Darenth,I couldn’t recommend this venue enough. From the day we walked into the darenth to view this venue we have always felt so welcomed and wanted. They couldn’t do anymore to help us as they went above and beyond. The venue is absolutely stunning from the outside to the inside 💕 myself and my husband would like the thank each and everyone of the staff here at the darenth no words can explain how much you made our dream become a reality 💕 we shall be booking to come back for our yearly anniversary. Highly recommend this venue*5
V339,The Darenth,"My Wife & I would firstly like to thank Jason for his professionalism, humour, and his skill in dealing with things in real time which put both of us at ease as well as all of our guests.

The catering staff on the day were magnificent and very caring towards us all.

Another plus was the generous of food which all guests appreciated, from the Canopes, Wedding Breakfast & Evening Buffet.

The only issue we did have is that it was agreed that we would have Jallof Rice with the Curry Goat & Fried Fish, but ending up having Rice & Peas with the Curry Goat.

The Jallof Rice being an African dish & Curry Goat being Carribean would have been excellent as we had them at our planning meeting 5 weeks before the Wedding.

The big disappointment was the performance of the in house DJ (Chelmer Discos).

The fact that we could not select our own DJ made us nervous about the music, hence we kept confirming whether the DJ had experience of performing for a mainly Afro Caribbean crowd.

We were advised that this was not an issue, and it turns out according to DJ that he lacks expertise with Afro Beats, Soco & Reggae.

We also asked for the love sign to be displayed as a backdrop in the Ballroom before the Wedding Ceremony commenced which was agreed upon by Chelmer Discos, however it arrived after 19.00.

When we tried to ascertain why the love sign was not delivered at the time agreed, and also, why the music was not mixed as appose to just playing tracks that we emailed to him.

In response we received a rude & threatening email from the in house DJ - Jimmy.

We both loved having our Wedding at The Darenth and all our guests have all commented on how brilliant it was & they loved Jason.

Regards. Mr & Mrs Hutton-Young"
V339,The Darenth,"We celebrated our wedding day at the darenth on Thursday 25th may.
I can not fault our experience at all. From start to finish Jason/Kerry & the team made our day perfect."
V339,The Darenth,Just had my wedding at The Darenth and what an amazing experience it was from start to finish. The staff are all fantastic they made me feel very special on my day. They kept us informed throughout the day with everything that was happening and are all so good at their jobs. The food was amazing and got so many compliments from our guests as did the stunning venue. Special shout out to Jason who was our rock during the day.
V339,The Darenth,"Fabulous venue, immaculately decorated. Kerry, Jason and the team were so kind and professional. I have worked at most venues being a wedding florist, but The Darenth was my choice. We had a beautiful day and they treated my guests like family. I will be recommending them to all my brides"
V340,The Spa Hotel,"We are absolutely overjoyed with how our religious wedding ceremony (Nikah) at the Spa Hotel turned out- truly, it felt like a dream come true. From the moment we began planning, the entire experience exceeded our expectations. Despite the tight timeline of just under four months, Emily Phipps, who I believe is any extremely talented Events and Wedding Coordinator worked tirelessly to bring our vision to life. I had so many ideas, most quite unconventional, but Emily welcomed them with open arms and went above and beyond to make it all happen.

Emily brought so much warmth, dedication, and joy to the table, and thanks to her, our religious ceremony was nothing short of magical. It’s rare to find genuine and skilful individuals in the wedding industry who can truly capture the essence of your dreams and make them a reality, but Emily did just that! We could not have asked for a more perfect day and now four months on, we find ourselves reminiscing over how perfect it was.

To Emily, Tina and Mate, we feel that you have become an extension of our own family! You were not only professional but genuinely caring, your hard work and attention to detail ensured that every moment on the day was flawless. We are so grateful for your contribution to making our wedding feel like a scene from a fairy tale. You are all an asset to The Spa Hotel Events Team!!

For anyone looking to host their special day at the Spa Hotel, we wholeheartedly recommend it. The staff are beyond talented and will treat your celebration with the utmost care and respect. They made our day unforgettable, and we will always be grateful to them for giving us memories that we will cherish forever.

Thank you, Spa Hotel, for making our dreams come true. You will always be a part of our hearts and wedding story."
V340,The Spa Hotel,"When our initial venue unexpectedly closed, we were feeling disheartened; however, we viewed The Spa Hotel and immediately fell in love with its natural beauty, especially its gorgeous Spa Temple. Our coordinator, Emily, was a star and helped us to plan our day to perfection. She was always on hand to answer any queries we had, and she also helped to set up on the day which was very kind of her! We ideally wanted an outdoor ceremony and the weather really came through for us, so we were able to marry surrounded by flowers! The day was an incredible experience from start to finish. David was our wedding coordinator on the day and he went above and beyond to ensure that everything ran smoothly. The team made the process fun and my partner and I were able to enjoy the wedding without any stress or anxiety. Thank you, The Spa Hotel team, for making our day so special."
V340,The Spa Hotel,"We couldn't be happier with our decision to celebrate our marriage at The Spa Hotel.

From beginning to end the service and attention has been incredible. From the moment I arrived to set up our decorations to breakfast in bed and clearing down the room.

We were made to feel special and so were our guests, anything that we needed was delivered.

The suites are beautiful as are the grounds, we felt so lucky to have them as a backdrop to our day.

Our meal was 5*, incredible, we received so many compliments, and food was a big part of the day for us. Delicious!

Thank you, to everyone."
V340,The Spa Hotel,"My husband and I got married and celebrated our wedding reception at the Spa Hotel in December 2023. The day was a dream from start to finish and the team at the Spa did absolutely everything to give us an unforgettable day. Tasha, our wedding coordinated, worked with us from the moment we started planning with the Spa and was available via email and phone regularly to help us work out the details of the day & evening. The setting is beautiful at the Spa, especially at Christmas with all the trees, lights, and decorations. The food was fantastic, everyone commented on how tasty the wedding breakfast & canapes were. The team were so responsive & helpful with the fact that I do not drink, so had all my alternatives to hand all throughout the day. What a perfect place to get married and celebrate our wedding, thank you so much to Tasha and all the team at the Spa Hotel!"
V340,The Spa Hotel,"Beautiful venue, amazing food, the best personable service from the first meeting to the last drink on the day! Thank you so much to Emily and David at the Spa hotel"
V340,The Spa Hotel,"Thank you so much! We had such a great day. For us the best day of our lives so far!

I could not fault the hospitality of you and your staff. If something wasn’t there you guys were straight on it. Nothing was too much to ask. Maty really put our minds at ease. Making sure I didn’t fall down the stairs and having water ready for us when he knew we’d be shaking before starting the ceremony!

It was like a well oiled machine and we didn’t have to lift a finger which took all stress away completely.

A lovely touch was adding the petals in the room and tidying up before we came upstairs. Made us relax so well.

Everyone was so helpful. I’d also like to mention how helpful one of your staff was. I’m not sure of his name, he had red hair. He could see I was panicking in the morning and reassured me by telling me everything was being set up for the ceremony. He was very accommodating and I’m sure he’ll go far in your industry!

Also thank you to Emily. Everything went so well and that’s all down to her coordination. Every staff member knew what needed to be done.

Again thank you so so much!! I’m sure we’ll be back again and of course we will be recommending you guys to everyone we know!!"
V340,The Spa Hotel,"We cannot thank the spa hotel enough, they were so incredible and the whole process made us at ease throughout. Our guests were so impressed at the quality of service, food and drink. We even had guests with sensitive allergies at our day and they had no issues. Everything went perfectly thanks to all the staff.
I couldn’t recommend them more to anyone. So thank you the spa hotel for making our dream wedding."
V340,The Spa Hotel,"We are so happy that we chose to have our wedding day at the Spa Hotel! Right from the beginning, you were so fantastic - fielding questions, keeping us on schedule with jobs and always being a very lovely friendly face to speak to whenever we needed. We so, so appreciate you.

The wedding venue was so beautiful - the photographs have come out so well! The backdrop is absolutely stunning. I’ve just forwarded you our wedding video tease and I’ll send some photos separately. Please feel free to use on any social media.

Your team on the day were great too, so lovely and kind to us."
V340,The Spa Hotel,We got married earlier this summer at The Spa Hotel and it was fabulous. Everybody there is so professional and are experts at what they do. Everybody was so accommodating and helped make our day so incredibly special. The organisation from everybody was amazing (in particular Natasha) and we had the best day. The day went without a hitch and was everything we dreamed of and more. Our guests had a great time and the food was incredible. I can't recommend The Spa Hotel as a wedding venue more!
V340,The Spa Hotel,"After months of planning, discussions and decisions we were finally married at The Spa Hotel, Royal Tunbridge Wells on Saturday.

Thank you to Tasha, David, Jake and the whole team for helping us on the way and delivering a perfect day (despite the weather) with superb and attentive service as well as everything we requested meeting and exceeding our expectations."
V341,Winters Barns,"This was the first venue we visited in person and knew from the moment we walked in the door, walked through the grounds and spoke with the team (Sophie) - this is where we want to get married.

The pre planning process, the correspondence, the queries, the multiple visits - nothing was too much trouble and everything was addressed promptly and in a detailed manner (if it was easier to explain something over the phone rather than email, thats exactly what they would do).

The venue was perfect for guests to explore and roam (& children) but can be contained in a safe surrounding.

On the day, I think it was summed up perfectly by our videographer ""the team are fantastic here, and if anything does go wrong on the day you wont even notice - they are so professional"". We can contest to this - it was perfect!

Thank you Sophie and the Team
x"
V341,Winters Barns,"This venue gives 10/10 for everything. We had looked at four venues before this one. As soon as we walked in we knew it was exactly what we wanted for our winter wedding and the need for onsite accommodation. The service was second to none, we didn’t have to lift a finger on the day and didn’t need to check anything or worry about anything. The caterers were five star, the service was exceptional, all of our guests remarked on the extremely professional service and amazing food. I would give it all 10 out of 10. The band, The Redfords were also superb, in the evening. Sally looked after everything superbly. If you want a magical stress free day that runs like clockwork - book it!"
V341,Winters Barns,"Winters Barns was the perfect setting for our wedding.
We had the most amazing day and could not recommend it highly enough.
Lizzie was absolutely amazing and made the whole process so easy for us.
Everyone was there to help but they were not intrusive at all.
All our guests were blown away by the service and the food - everyone has made great memories.
We have some amazing photos from the grounds and it was so easy having everything all in one place - from getting ready to staying overnight.
Even the set up and taking down was done for us so we didn't have to think about anything - we could just enjoy it all.
I could not have wished for a better venue and they exceeded our expectations by far!"
V341,Winters Barns,"For a venue as busy as Winters Barns, they truly made us feel like the only people getting married, remembering the small details and providing invaluable advice throughout planning and coordination. Getting excited with us during the planning, liaising with our vendors and giving us helpful prompts as we got closer to the day. We never once struggled to get in contact with the venue or get a clear answer on our questions… and there was a few!
On our final meeting where we ran through all the little details, we were met with suggestions and solid guidance which left us feeling confident our dream day was going to come to life as we imagined.
Sally is a SUPERSTAR and our day was run to perfection thanks to her. She pays attention to detail and run us on time to the minute, but she also had lots of fun with it. Popping in to check on us all getting ready always with a big smile and some sound advice and a little time check! Sally put us both as ease as we knew if there was an issue she would resolve it.
Our day at the venue was perfect, from getting ready and building up to the ceremony, it was faultless. The call button in the getting ready spaces is brilliant, this saved the men who were all struggling with their pocket squares and needed super Sally to come and save them!
The accommodation was beautiful and the perfect way to extend the celebrations a bit longer with a recovery breakfast with our families the next morning.
We honestly had the perfect day, as did our guests and have received endless compliments on the venue; the service and everything in between. If we were to relive the day we would not change a single thing.
Thank you so much to the winters barns team and Sally, we couldn’t have done it without you!"
V341,Winters Barns,"Right from the first appointment we knew the venue was gorgeous and it was the one for us! Since booking the staff were always so helpful over emails for any queries whilst I was planning! On the big day we had Lizzie look after us, she is truly the best at what she does!!
I was so set on having an outdoor ceremony but due to weather it had to be inside, however I wasn’t disappointed! It was beautiful inside especially with the fresh new hops (September wedding). Everything went smoothly and we couldn’t have had a better day. We used all the accommodation on site too which was great, clean and comfortable!"
V341,Winters Barns,"Winters Barns is an incredible venue. It has a beautiful rustic charm, from the exposed beams in the bar, wedding breakfast and dance floor areas, to the dried hops hanging from the ceiling. The courtyard is stunning and was well used by our guests well into the evening. The pond with the bridge makes for beautiful pictures and was a huge selling point for us.
The staff were truly amazing. I cannot fault them. They’re incredibly warm and friendly and really do make you feel special. They never once gave the impression they do this every day, rather that yours is the most important day in the world!
We absolutely loved our day - it was truly unforgettable, largely thanks to the brilliant team at Winters Barns."
V341,Winters Barns,"A truly stunning venue! We cannot thank Winters Barns enough for making our day so incredibly special. The staff are so friendly, welcoming and professional, nothing is too much to ask of them and they ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible. We were able to fully enjoy our day knowing everything was being dealt with behind the scenes.
The venue and its grounds are beautiful, the perfect setting for some stunning wedding pictures! The facilities at this venue are amazing from the garden, the barn itself, the salon and pump room to get ready in the morning of the wedding. The accommodation is beautiful and so incredibly clean!
If you’re looking for a barn wedding, I cannot recommend Winters Barns enough! You will not be disappointed! Thank you once again!"
V341,Winters Barns,"We would to thank Sally and her team at Winters Barns for making our special day come to life. This venue is absolutely beautiful allowing for some stunning photos. All our guests commented on its cutsie barn vibes and well maintained grounds.
The food was exactly what we wanted with our 3 course meal and evening food, all delivered with amazing service.
We couldn’t praise or recommend this venue enough!
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
V341,Winters Barns,"Our wedding at Winters Barns was a dream come true. From the moment we arrived, we were captivated by the enchanting atmosphere and timeless charm. The stunning surroundings and well-maintained grounds created the perfect backdrop for our special day.

The staff at Winters Barns went above and beyond to ensure every detail was perfect. Their professionalism and warm hospitality made us feel truly special. From the seamless coordination to the meticulous attention to detail, the entire day ran smoothly, allowing us to relax and fully enjoy each moment.

The ceremony area, with its rustic elegance and intimate setting, created an unforgettable experience. The reception space was equally impressive, with charming decor and a spacious layout that comfortably accommodated our guests. The lighting and ambiance added a touch of romance, making the evening even more magical.

We can’t rate Winters Barns highly enough. It exceeded our expectations in every way, providing us with cherished memories that will last a lifetime. If you’re looking for a wedding venue that combines beauty, elegance, and exceptional service, Winters Barns is the perfect choice."
V341,Winters Barns,"This is a fabulous location with great flexible spaces both indoor and outdoor options.
Sophie and the team were great communicators. Incredibly organised, and took all the stress of the away allowing us to enjoy the best day of our lives. 😍🥂"
V342,Cooling Castle Barn,"Cooling Castle Barn really was our perfect wedding venue. We fell in love instantly and it was the only venue we looked at for our wedding and booked immediately before we even left! The price of the venue and what is included is incredible, it was worth every single penny and we’d highly recommend. Every single staff member we came into contact with couldn’t have helped enough! Out toastmaster (Steve) was absolutely amazing and co-ordinator on the day (Chelsea) was so so helpful with everything that we needed and made sure that everything was sorted and we didn’t have to think of a thing on the day! The getting ready rooms were perfect and the food was absolutely incredible!! We had so many comments about the food and the venue in general from our guests, everyone absolutely loved it!! Thank you so much, we had the most amazing wedding at the most perfect venue x"
V342,Cooling Castle Barn,"From start to finish, the staff were so friendly and professional! Everything was broken down and made so simple, the app was incredible to help keep track of planning. On the day Becky was honestly everything we could have asked for, she kept us updated on everything that was happening whilst we were getting ready and made everything run so smoothly. Would recommend this venue to anyone, we had so many compliments on our choice and had everything we needed under one roof! Topped off by returning to our room with champagne, cake and chocolates. We cannot say thank you enough!! Mr and Mrs Jeeves x"

V343,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We got married on 17 May 2024 and planned a weekend of celebrations with our family and friends, including a 'We tied the knot' cocktail party in the Brasserie on the 18 May 2024. The hotel has a number of quirky and interesting spaces perfect for adding a different feel to parts of your celebration as well as different photo opportunities. It has a trendy and luxurious feel with lots of unique and modern touches. OWP is also a stones throw away from the historic Pantiles which whilst not only beautiful also had a selection of bars, restaurants and boutique shops to entertain our guests during down time. Many of our guests commented it was like being in Europe and again the surrounding areas are perfect for photos.

Not only is the venue beautiful, but the staff and service are absolutely incredible and I do not say this lightly, the service was second to none and everyone was welcoming and friendly creating a true home away from home experience. Karen our Wedding Co-ordinator was amazing and flexible to our different needs. One of the things that attracted us to OWP was our wedding was treated as an individual celebration something we had not found at other venues which had a fairly set itinerary. The food was amazing with a large choice of options, we opted for a deluxe choice menu and it did not disappoint. It was also great value for money which enabled us to carry out our celebrations over a long weekend whilst also focusing on our entertainment and creating the atmosphere we wanted.

If you want a venue that is modern, trendy, flexible and different from the traditional country house wedding then I highly recommend. We have a weekend of memories at One Warwick Park with our nearest and dearest that we will treasure forever and can't wait to return for our anniversary's.

Thank you to the whole One Warwick Park team! Sarah & Sam"
V343,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We had the pleasure of having our wedding at the Warwick Park Hotel, it was an amazing experience for us as a couple and all our guests. Karen our Event coordinator was great with us, she was very receptive to our ideas and did all she can to make it possible even though our wedding was on short notice.

For the actual day, the whole team was excellent, nothing was too much for them.

They went above and beyond for all our guest, one thing that stood out for me was on the day of the wedding the Club room which was the standard complimentary room for the wedding night was used by my wife to get ready in the morning, to avoid us getting back to the same room and enhance our experience on our big day we were upgraded to the Deluxe Room with other complementaries which just made our day perfect. All our bags were moved for us we didn't even need to touch anything which was a really nice touch for us.

Can't say a thank you big enough to Karen and her excellent team, we were chose Warwick on recommendation and we can boldly say we were not disappointed.

And will definitely recommend Warwick Park Hotel to anyone looking for a top of the range service and venue.

Thank you."
V343,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We had an amazing wedding! The venue allowed us to be flexible with our requirements. We had so many lovely comments about the venue, hotel and food. Service and staff were amazing.
The day went to plan and was perfect in every way.
Our wedding meal was lovely. The function room looked beautiful.
Our room, junior suite was spacious and really enjoyed the 3 nights we was there.
Thank you to Karen and all the staff for making our day so special!!"
V343,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We had a lovely day at One Warwick Park for our wedding. Karen was very helpful and stayed the entire wedding day. Finn and Alice are 2 amazing members of staff.
The food was lovely and everything was organised well. Thank you OWP."
V343,One Warwick Park Hotel,"One Warwick Park is utterly amazing for a wedding venue!

I cant thank Karen and every staff member at OWP for making our wedding day perfect.

Karen and I connected via emails and calls in the months leading up to the wedding, the communication was perfect. Everything I ever asked for or things we talked about nothing was never a problem, Karen and the OWP team were brilliant to work with.

The venue is so gorgeous, Modern and Elegant. The Room is bright and large with a gorgeous fire place and open brick wall with wooden beams.
The hotel rooms are so sophisticated and modern. We stayed in ‘The House’ and for Bridal party prep this was the perfect location!!! It was dreamy!!! Spacious, comfy beds, gorgeous kitchen and bathrooms. It was so special to stay with bridesmaids & Family members the night before, but each of us having our own bedroom in a house environment, the House is just amazing!

The food was fabulous!
The chef created some gorgeous dishes for 80 guests, many with dietary requirements, this was no trouble at all and each guests feedback about their meal was that it was all delicious! Thank you chef!!
Our evening buffet – the compliments we received were great here too!. Especially the chicken goujons!
The wedding tasting afternoon OWP hosted to sample wedding day food was amazing. We tried all the wines and dishes, it was so lovely to enjoy this day as a pre wedding day date day. Thank you so much!

I popped into the venue multiple times before the wedding day to visualize and ask various questions that I ever had. Any team member I ever met was so friendly, helpful and kind. Nothing was ever a problem for anyone.

Days before our wedding I sent Karen a photo of some cocktails I liked, Karen worked with the food and beverage manager to bring my idea into reality. I was so happy – thank you so much!

On the day of the wedding Karen you popped in and out, and were there to support me from 7am - I loved it so much the way you kept connected with us, thank you!
My emotions were high throughout the day and this didn’t phase you at all, your support was truly appreciated!

We could not be any more happier with the way our wedding day went. We had such amazing feedback from our guests on how gorgeous the venue and the hotel are. And How good the food was!

Thank you so much for everything Karen. You are great at what you do!!
Enjoy every moment of your own wedding very soon! We are sending you all our love!

Please pass our huge thanks to everyone who worked and helped us during our wedding.
It is so very much appreciated. xxxx"
V343,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We will never be able to thank Karen and the whole One Warwick Park team enough. We would highly recommend this beautiful venue to anyone planning their wedding and are truly grateful for the effort that went into ensuring our day was exactly what we wanted. The food was amazing and we had lots of compliments from the guests on how friendly and polite the bar staff were.
Thank you for helping to make us the happiest we’ve ever felt. We can’t wait to come back and stay for our first wedding anniversary."
V343,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We always knew we wanted a boutique venue to suit our modest budget and the moment we saw OWP we fell in love with its chic and simple interior, perfect for putting our own spin on our special day. Karen and the OWP team were fantastic throughout the wedding planning process. No request was too big/ difficult for Karen and she was so attentive to our wants and needs. We had the most magical Christmas wedding and cannot be happier with how it all turned out! Thank you Karen and team for making our special day perfect!"
V343,One Warwick Park Hotel,"We loved this wedding venue the first time we saw it. We wanted a Christmas wedding and the room with the beams, lights and Christmas tree looked amazing. Planning of the wedding was helped by Karen who gave fantastic recommendations. Nothing was too much trouble. We had the most amazing day. Big thank you."
V343,One Warwick Park Hotel,"Cannot thank Karen and the OWP staff enough for our magical day. From the moment we saw the venue we fell in love and everything was so simple and we wanted for nothing.

The venue has a modern class in an area of Old style beauty. The venue can comfortably hold either a large number or a smaller more intimate celebration and will still look magical."
V343,One Warwick Park Hotel,"Where do I even start….

When we first visited the hotel I knew it would make the perfect venue for our wedding. The function room was perfect, modern, perfect size, the bar was amazing. It just ticked all the boxes.

Karen was absolutely amazing, she was there every step of the way answering all my question and giving advice. She helped us organised our day and help us make an idea on paper turn into the most amazing day.

Before the wedding day we got to attend a wedding menu tasting session was great, every dish we tried was lovely and so happy with our choices everyone at the wedding said how amazing the food was.

On the day the help from all the staff was amazing from welcoming our guests and helping all our suppliers, made me feel so calm as the bride as I knew I didn’t have to worry about anything. From start to finish the wedding was perfect and it wouldn’t have happened without the help of Karen and everyone at the hotel - they turned around the rooms so quickly and the service from the bar staff was perfect.

I couldn’t recommend this venue enough they have everything you need and more for the perfect wedding."
V344,Chapel House Estate,"Chapel House Estate and the team were absolutely amazing! We knew from the first time we saw the venue that it was the one - every single location is beautiful and provides stunning photo opportunities. Every person that we spoke to was so helpful, especially Georgia who was our fabulous on-the-day co-ordinator! We did have a few issues with music during dinner but these were promptly rectified by the staff (with the help of the Head Chef's phone!). The food was absolutely fabulous and I think everyone who came to our wedding was absolutely blown away from start to finish. Thank you so much for making our day everything we dreamed it would be!"
V344,Chapel House Estate,"The most amazing, stunningly beautiful wedding venue, catered for our micro wedding with as much care an attention as a big wedding, Jade our wedding co-ordinator was amazing! The food in the no 9 restaurant was as out of this world! Highly recommend!"
V344,Chapel House Estate,"We cannot recommend Chapel House Estate enough. From the very beginning the team here were so helpful and accommodating.

We’ve been to weddings before that have felt a little disorganised and of course, things can happen out of anyone’s control, however, as soon as booked our wedding here we felt like we were in safe hands. Throughout the entire process, we felt so at ease, and that’s thanks for the team. Georgia and the team worked so hard for us and it really showed. The day ran so smoothly.

The grounds in the venue are truly stunning too and offered the perfect backdrop for our special day. We decided to get married in August as we really loved the orchard and gardens, and to top it off we spent the rest of the day in the beautiful courtyard. We have to mention the food too. We opted for the BBQ option and wow. It was so delicious and all our guests really loved it.

In summary, you won’t regret getting married here. The venue is stunning, the team are fantastic and the food is to die for. Thank you so much Chapel House Estate."
V344,Chapel House Estate,"We had our wedding here in the court yard this last Sunday and all I can say is wow - they exceeded our expectations and more .

V344,Chapel House Estate,"My husband and I got married here in August and had the most magical day. All the team, particularly Georgia, Lori, Jade and Sam, were incredible in organising our day and ensuring the day went seamlessly.
Every detail was perfect.
The venue is truly breathtaking and all our guests were blown away by how magical it looked.
The food was exquisite which all our guests have continued to talk about.
We couldn’t have asked for a better day and will continue to visit for our anniversaries.

V344,Chapel House Estate,"We got married at Chapel House Estate in August 2023.

From being shown around the venue by the owner a year earlier, we knew it would be perfect, and indeed, it was!

The grounds are beautifully maintained.

The Chapel House has been finished to an exquisite standard, and the other accommodation on site is great and was loved by our guests.

The whole site was impeccably maintained and as clean as a whistle.

There is ample parking.

The Team went out of their way to accommodate us, with a bespoke menu and served individual alternatives for those with non standard dietary requirements (vegan, veggie and various intolerances!).

The food was of an exceptional standard for over 100 guests and the service was both charming and faultless. It was apparent to us both that the entire team were committed to making our wedding day a resounding success!

In short we were completely blown away by the venue when we first saw it and it overdelivered! What a superb venue!

Special shouts out to Jade, Georgia and the chefs! You are now part of our story!

Would we recommend it?

YES, WE WOULD!"
V344,Chapel House Estate,"If you're dreaming of a wedding that transports you to a faraway destination without leaving the shores of Kent, look no further than Chapel House Estate. This hidden gem is a testament to luxury, elegance, and the promise of an unforgettable wedding experience.

From the moment I stepped onto the grounds, I was whisked away to a Mediterranean haven. The outdoor waiting reception area exuded charm and sophistication, adorned with lush greenery, fragrant blooms, and tasteful decor. The soft rustling of leaves and the gentle breeze lent an air of serenity, setting the perfect tone for the day.

The outdoor wedding setup was nothing short of magical. With sweeping views that seemed to stretch endlessly, it felt as if I was watching the exchanging vows in a private paradise. The attention to detail in the decorations was impeccable, and the natural beauty of the surroundings only enhanced the atmosphere of romance and celebration.

The resort's reception area was a true showstopper. Elegant and opulent, it provided a stunning backdrop for speeches and the main course. The seamless blend of indoor and outdoor spaces allowed us to enjoy the best of both worlds. The expansive glass windows offered uninterrupted views of the picturesque surroundings, while the tasteful interior design added an element of grandeur to the celebration.

The culinary experience was nothing short of extraordinary. The menu showcased a fusion of flavours that left myself raving for more. From delectable appetisers to the exquisite main courses, every dish was a work of art washed down with the very best drop of Rosé. The culinary team's attention to detail and dedication to creating a memorable dining experience was evident in every bite.

The staff at Chapel House Estate were outstanding with a special shout out to Katie for really going above and beyond. Their professionalism, warmth, and attentiveness ensured that every aspect of our special day ran seamlessly. They anticipated my needs before I even realised them, and their genuine smiles and willingness to go above and beyond left a lasting impression on myself and it seemed all guests. A huge kudos to Darren & the force on such an incredible team dynamic.

In conclusion, Chapel House Estate is a true gem in Kent, offering a wedding experience that rivals the most exotic destinations abroad. The combination of breathtaking outdoor spaces, luxurious indoor settings, world-class cuisine, and exceptional service creates a truly unforgettable celebration. If you're seeking a wedding venue that transcends the ordinary, Chapel House Estate is the perfect choice. My heart is filled with gratitude for the memories that were created in this enchanting oasis."
V344,Chapel House Estate,"This venue is first class. All our guests said it was one of the best wedding venues that they have been to. Our day surpassed all of our expectations. The staff made sure the day was seamless. Food was great, service was amazing and the venue is stunning. Would highly recommend to anyone in a heartbeat. Special thank you to Jade and Georgia for ensuring the day was so special. X"
V344,Chapel House Estate,"A few weeks ago my partner and I had the complete pleasure of attending our dear friends’ wedding at Chapel House Estate.
Of course it was lovely to attend and be part of their day. We had heard good things about the venue, but we were taken back with its fabulousness.
Close by to our home in Broadstairs, we felt we had arrived at a far away country estate far further away than we have travelled.
This set the perfect stage for the quintessential and stylish day of celebrations, which continued with partying and fun into the late evening.
The day was faultless.

Having worked in the wedding and events sector both in the UK and the Middle East, I have been lucky to have experienced many events, both as guest and a professional.
The wedding at CHE was up there with the best, from the F&B to the furnishings and staff.
In fact so good it even made me consider getting married again!"
V345,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"The team at Port Lympne were absolutely phenomenal. Months of planning and working with us to ensure our big day would go off without any issues, and it led to a really stress-free day for the both of us, allowing us to fully enjoy our wedding day.

There are far too many things to mention, it’s simply impossible to fully cover the scope of everything they have done for us as part of our wedding.

Guests were raving about pretty much every aspect of the day, and many said it was the best wedding they’d ever been to and probably will ever go to. Quite a few of the vendors made a point of communicating a similar sentiment to us as well!

Comminication is unparalleled, they will do everything they possible can to accommodate any request you may have, and worked tirelessly to provide us with an amazing experience.

We really did get to have a dream wedding, far beyond anything we could have ever imagined.

An immense thank you to everyone, the staff on-site, logistics team, event coordinators, etc… everyone came together to put us first and make the day the most amazing day of our lives."
V345,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Port Lympne is an incredible venue, such a unique and special location for your special day. We had spent our first weekend away as a couple there so it was great to go back 6 years later to get married.
All of our guests loved the venue and the day, and they still talk about the safari and how incredible it was.
Sadly for us, we were let down by the operations team on the day which caused unnecessary stress. The event team were great in the build up, with a few minor issues due to limited flexibility on their end. We also had about 3 different main points of contact due to staff turnover and therefore the package we agreed to and had changed and led to tense discussions. The issues for us arose on the day where the event team handed over the wedding to the operations team who we hadn't met and it seemed to be the first time they had heard of our wedding. Despite handing them a detailed folder explaining how the tables should be laid out, seating plans and all the other essentials, they made numerous mistakes resulting in the wedding party having to fix many of these just before the bride arrived! A few of our suppliers commented how it felt like the venue mustn't have had many weddings due to some of the issues on the day.

However, despite all of these challenges, everything else was magical. The venue spaces are incredible and the food was exceptional. The safari was a real highlight for us and all the guests."
V345,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"We couldn’t have chosen a more magical venue for our wedding than Port Lympne. The setting was absolutely breathtaking—our guests were in awe of the views and the atmosphere - and that was before the wedding started!

The team at Port Lympne went above and beyond to make sure every detail was perfect, allowing us to enjoy every moment without a worry. The pergola and the orangery looked phenomenal in sun!

provided such a charming space for our reception. The food was exceptional, tailored to our tastes, and so many of our guests commented on how delicious it was.

One of the highlights was incorporating the wildlife reserve into our day. After the meal all of our guests got on trucks for a guided safari, which they absolutely loved—it added such a unique and memorable touch to the whole experience.

We couldn’t recommend Port Lympne enough. It was truly the perfect venue, and we’ll cherish the memories of our special day forever."
V345,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Port Lympne is an absolutely stunning venue, from the moment you arrive, you can feel how special and beautiful it is. The pergola has been designed so beautifully, with faux flowers intertwined all around it. It doesn't need any further decorating, it is stunning. What is great about this too is that the staff can put up Perspex glass over the windows if the weather isn't ideal, or can leave the windows open for a nice breeze if the day is good. The orangery is breath taking. As a bride, the worry about making either of these areas look pretty was a job already completed. Easily, the best and most beautiful venue.

The Wedding Team are incredible from start to finish. Nothing is too much trouble, they respond quickly to emails. I felt so cared for throughout the entire process, both myself and my husband were impressed by them. It is more expensive than other venues, but they are worth it. I'd hire them again in a heartbeat. We changed things close to the wedding day, the team easily accommodated, we asked for a different area for the reception drinks (we had to pay for this), but again, the team said yes and adjusted the scheduling in a thoughtful manner so we had more time by the southern terrace.

Food is amazing. We had lots of compliments about this. They catered for a number of vegetarian and vegan guests with ease. The evening buffet was so good. Plenty of good high quality food. I really was impressed.

We had the safari between the meal and evening reception - it was the best. Guests loved it, we loved it.

Honestly the best venue and staff. I want to attend a PL wedding as a guest now!!"
V345,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Looking for a spectacular, unique venue with exceptional customer service? Look no further than Port Lympne! It's hard to find a better wedding venue. From the staff to the views, the facilities to the accommodation, and the food to the animals, everything is outstanding. Every member of staff goes above and beyond to make everyone feel welcome and to provide unforgettable experiences. Words like ""unbelievable,"" ""breathtaking,"" and ""stunning"" were frequently used by our guests, many of whom claimed it was the best wedding they had ever attended.

Special shout-outs go to…

Ceyda: Thank you for being our incredible wedding coordinator. Your responsiveness to countless emails and your dedication to making our big day exactly what we dreamed of were remarkable. Thank you for altering our function sheet so many times without question and for holding my drinks and fluffing my dress when needed!

Charlotte: Your calming presence and willingness to accommodate every request were invaluable. Thank you for keeping me calm in the morning and for your excellent communication throughout the day, ensuring everything ran seamlessly.

Our glorious toastmasters, Jonathan and Nikki: WOW, what a duo! Thank you for ensuring our day ran smoothly and for guiding our guests flawlessly. We (and our guests) loved both of your outfits, especially the park ranger uniforms.

Harry: Thank you for rescuing me and my bridesmaids when we locked ourselves out of Rhino Lodge.

Wedding breakfast serving staff: Your prompt, well-coordinated, and faultless delivery of our food was exceptional.

The chefs: Thank you for producing a mouthwatering three-course meal that was beautifully presented. Our guests couldn't believe the high standard of food and that all main courses were served hot. Thank you also for accommodating special requests and dietary requirements.

Evening bar staff: Your constant smiles and enthusiasm, especially joining in with the Macarena, added so much fun to our celebration.

Hotel staff: Thank you for assisting our overnight guests with check-in and ensuring their bags were taken to their rooms, allowing them to celebrate without interruption.

Our wedding at Port Lympne was a dream come true, thanks to the incredible team and the breathtaking venue. We highly recommend it to anyone looking for a truly magical wedding experience."
V345,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Venue
We opted for Port Lympne to start with as we were swept away with the beauty of the venue. It’s truly the most beautiful place we visited. The mansion house is a lovely reception area, the pergola and orangery are private so just your guests get to enjoy this section. The pergola is light and beautiful, and perfect backdrop for a ceremony. It’s really easy to dress up with flowers, as it’s already so beautiful it doesn’t take much.
The orangery is amazing, high ceilings, beautiful greenery & rose bushes surround the area. There’s lovely lawns which you have the option to play garden games on & have photos.
The Moroccan courtyard is perfect for photos, and again doesn’t need any extra dressing or decoration to make it look beautiful - it’s simply stunning everywhere!

The Wedding Team
First the venue sweeps you the way, then the staff do! They are extremely helpful, lovely and attentive. I emailed them a couple of times a week leading up to the big day and they replied within a few hours every time.
On the big day they weren’t overbearing, no request was too much & they were there whenever we needed them.
They do multiple walk throughs with you & introduce you to everyone who is working on your wedding so you know who to ask if there’s any additional requests.

Food & Drink
On the lead up, you get to try the wedding food. They also offer a choice of two for starters mains and desserts (in contrast to other venues we viewed which only allowed for one choice).
The food was incredible, rich and yummy (not dry at all which you sometimes find with wedding food).
The queue for the bar was quick all night (and we had over 100 guests who are all big drinkers). There was no draught beer which we were worried about, but it was fine on the day as this meant everyone was served quickly.
The wine they pair the food with was gorgeous - and again you get to try all this before the big day.
They were accommodating to vegetarians and multiple allergies. This was all planned before hand & we had no issues with this on our day.

Safari
We opted for safari and it was a really magical and memorable touch. All our guests loved it!
You also get to use the buggies the day after the wedding (up to 10am) which is a lovely way to recover from the wedding and a fun way to start your first day of marriage bliss!

There’s nothing more we could have asked for! Perfect for 100-150 guests."
V345,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Port Lympne was an outstanding venue the whole team amazing from the events team to the ground staff always welcoming and helpful up to the day and then the wedding itself.
Safari it’s a great added extra guests totally loved. The mansion house was a perfect venue that sold it for us on our first visit. Outstanding accommodation across the site and food across the day was perfect.
Thank you port lympne team."
V345,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Our October wedding at Port Lympne was stunning - we had our ceremony in the Pergola followed by a reception in The Orangery, and the day ran smoothly. The staff are friendly and accommodating, the venue itself is beautiful with very little additional decorations needed, the safari was a huge talking point and we've been told repeatedly that the food was the best anyone had at a wedding all year. We'd definitely recommend booking your wedding here, you won't regret it."
V345,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"Port Lympne as it's no normal wedding venue, it's the Disneyland of Kent wedding venues. We would also like to say a big thank you to Stephanie who worked so hard to make sure the day was perfect. She made our dream weddings come true with Georgina, and Olivia, who handled every aspect of the day so well. All our guests were blown away and had the time of their lives. They keep telling us how perfect the venue was. It really does have it all: 5 star food, the most stunning spaces, water features, coastal views, and breathtaking grounds with animals from across the world (which all our guests got to see as part of our day). If you are looking for a venue that ticks all the boxes Port Lympne and the team can and will make this happen.The team managed everything so professionally, and they made our dream come true! Thank you from the bottom of our hearts."
V345,Port Lympne Hotel & Reserve,"We were married at Port Lympne on the August bank holiday 2023 and would thoroughly recommend the venue.

The Port Lympne team were incredibly helpful and responsive throughout. No question or detail was too much for Stephanie and Annie, who provided an excellent standard of service; they were straightforward to deal with and any concerns or queries were dealt with swiftly.
The wedding day itself ran smoothly and was truly memorable for both us and our guests. The combination of the pergola and the orangery provide for a stunning venue. There are also so many locations for beautiful photos!

A key reason we chose Port Lympne was the high-quality food we had experienced on previous visits to the garden room. For our wedding breakfast, we selected the sea bass with brown crab gnocchi, which was delicious and enjoyed by all guests. There is also an option to select a second/alternative main for those who preferred a non-fish dish.

In the evening we surprised our guests with the safari; it is a must-do and made the day truly memorable and unique.

We also had over 50 guests staying at the venue overnight and Stephanie and Annie efficiently co-ordinated the transport and accommodation elements.

Overall, we had a fantastic day and would highly recommend Port Lympne to couples seeking a unique and special wedding day."
V346,Salomons Estate,"I am so happy my (now) husband and I decided to have our wedding here! Everything about our big day was nothing short of perfect. From the moment we looked at this venue, I know it was everything we wanted.

Our day of coordinator, Leah, was absolutely lovely. Not only is she attentive, but she is kind, thoughtful, and incredibly detail-oriented, making every part of the process seamless and stress-free. I can’t be more grateful to have had her by my side.

The venue decorated for the holidays just days before our wedding, providing us with beautiful added decor and magic! My friends and family love the many rooms and areas to explore, including the museum, gardens, bar, terrace, etc.

We opted for afternoon tea for our wedding breakfast and pizza for late night bites and our guests absolutely loved it! They offered options for our friends with gf, veggie, etc dietary requirements, and people raved about their meals! They have options for everyone.

Between the beautiful venue, genuinely lovely staff, and delicious food and drink, I cannot be more grateful to Leah and everyone at Salomons. I got to live out my fairytale dream wedding here, and I am so excited for every couple who chooses to do the same. You will have the best day of your lives."
V346,Salomons Estate,"The venue is absolutely stunning which our guests also commented on, from the impressive driveway entrance to the beautiful decor inside. We had our ceremony in the Gold Room which had so much detail we did not need to decorate too much further. We then moved through to the Drawing Room for our Wedding Breakfast and Evening Reception. This was the perfect size for our wedding and we were able to decorate the whole area (including the bar and lounge area) creating an inviting atmosphere. The staff are absolutely amazing, from the initial enquiry to the planning to the actual day. The Events team were always on hand to answer any questions or emails and the bar staff on the day were so polite and professional. Even after the wedding, the following day, the staff were still happy and helpful. The food is amazing and so tasty, it was served quickly and hot , allergies were very easily accommodated and the prosecco was lovely. There was nothing that was too much trouble and our Wedding Planner Leah could not do enough to make sure everything went well."
V346,Salomons Estate,"Salomons will now hold a special place in our heart forever. Thankyou so much for everything. Erin our coordinator was incredible and I’m so pleased with her ethics, friendliness and experience. Thankyou!"
V346,Salomons Estate,"We had a summer wedding at Salomons and were lucky enough to have an outdoor ceremony and cocktail hour. It was the perfect place to host our guests (we had 140 guests) and there was a lot of space for everyone to explore, sit and walk around.
We had many compliments about the quality of the food. Our suppliers even said it was the best meal they'd had while working! We did the Sharing Roast and having the guests in chef's hat to carve the roast was a very popular part of our day.
I can't compliment the events team at Salomon's enough. In the last month before the wedding, they were so responsive and went above and beyond. We had a few changes in staff on their side and changed our main coordinator but it had 0 impact to the quality of our day.
On the day, our coordinator Willow was exceptional - keeping the show running and making sure that everyone was well looked after.
We were beyond happy with our wedding and Salomon's will always hold a special place in our heart!"
V346,Salomons Estate,"What can I say, this is a beautiful venue for start. We had Willow as our coordinator and she was beyond perfect! She made sure everything was on point and was excellent with communication! The staff on the day were so helpful and friendly, everyone was raving about them. It was just amazing! I wish we could do it again! Our wedding was three weeks ago, so we are still on cloud 9. The venue catered for all our guests dietaries & were amazing with accommodation!"
V346,Salomons Estate,"Salomons Estate was more than I could have asked for. Erin, our coordinator, was so on top of things throughout the day and so helpful. We had to plan this whole thing from abroad and it was quite stressful but Erin was so calm throughout the process and there were no issues whatsoever. The venue was absolutely beautiful and such a great space for hold events - highly highly recommend! Also, the food was excellent!"
V346,Salomons Estate,"I cannot recommend getting married at Salomons Estate enough.

The whole team are amazing to work with and when first visiting I felt so relaxed and at ease in their company - a lot of other venues felt very pushy in comparison looking back.

We absolutely loved that they had so many options in regards to food and drinks packages. We went for their bbq option which was perfect as we didn’t want a 3 course sit down, we wanted something a bit more relaxed. The food was delicious and everyone said they felt really full compared to some other weddings they’d been to!

The grounds themselves are stunning. We were so fortunate that we got married on the terrace, but the back up room inside was also beautiful if the weather hadn’t been on our side! We had our reception in the science theatre that is such a unique room and so beautiful.

Our wedding parties stayed the night before in the gatehouse and the bridal cottage, most of our wedding party also stayed the evening of the wedding in the hotel accommodation. This really extended our wedding celebration and I’m so grateful we could all stay on site in lovely accommodation.

I could go on and on for hours, but to summarise; the venue is not only stunning but is matched in amazing service."
V346,Salomons Estate,"Salomons was a beautiful location for a wedding! We had a winter wedding and chose it because we liked the indoor setup for our wedding for approximately 100 people, and also wanted on site accommodation. However, the grounds are beautiful and we got lucky with the weather and have had many pretty shots taken outside.

The events team helped us pull together our wedding plan and ensured matters ran smoothly on the day. We had a great time with the tasting in the lead up to our wedding. We also used a number of the recommended suppliers from Salomons and together they put together a truly amazing wedding. Erin helped coordinate our day and also chaueffered us around for our photos as the grounds were a bit wet!

The catering team did a top job on the day. Our guests were raving about how good the food was, and how generous the portions were too! Salomons offered a good selection of wines and their F&B team were flexible to try to source drinks that weren't readily available on the menu. If needed, we were able to supply our own bottles and pay corkage.

My father has some health issues, and the team did everything they could to make his experience on the day as comfortable as possible. I'm really grateful to Salomons for this.

In summary, I'd highly recommend Salomons Estate as a venue for anyone considering a wedding venue in Kent."
V346,Salomons Estate,"We knew instantly when we arrived to view the venue that this was where we wanted to get married. We were made to feel at home, and nothing felt like too much bother. The team were constantly on-hand to answer questions throughout the process, and catered to all of our requests. We had never really thought about an outside wedding, but the South Terrace took our breath away when we saw it in person!
Our wedding day was magical, and ran completely smoothly due to the hard work of the team throughout the day. Our guests commented on the service of the team - there was never a queue at the bar, there was always someone on-hand to help out, and our wedding planner (Fiona) had this magic ability of being everywhere at once! The food was outstanding, and our guests were well-fed and watered during the day. We honestly couldn’t have asked for more from the team!"
V346,Salomons Estate,"We got married at Salomons Estate in June 2023 and it was incredible! We literally have zero negatives to write. Everything from Fiona and her team was brilliant. The care and attention to detail, the day went smoothly and perfect.
All of our guests commented on how delicious the canapés and food were.
We will 10000% be returning for our anniversary.
Thank you everyone at Salomons for ensuring we had the most perfect day."
V347,The Castle Westenhanger,"We had our special day here in April 2024 and all we can say is incredible!

The booking process was easy and so personal, the online planning system was so easy to use and the Westenhanger team were always at the end of an email if we needed anything at all - nothing was too much trouble.
The day went perfectly to plan thanks to the wonderful wedding coordinators, the food was amazing, the DJ was brilliant - genuinely there was nothing we would have changed.

We can’t thank the Westenhanger team enough for everything that they have done in making sure that our wedding day was perfect."
V347,The Castle Westenhanger,"We had an incredible day and are still getting so many compliments from our guests and suppliers on how beautiful the different parts of the castle and its grounds are. It was an unusual wedding (queer Jewish/Christian interfaith), but Jackie, Vicky and co helped to make sure that we had all the things that were important to us, from the vegan food and alcohol-free drinks to the gender neutral toilets to getting the dancing going before the meal had even started. The ceremony room was perfect (and a special thank you to the person who went up on a ladder to put a covering over the boar head that's mounted on the wall!), and we had some amazing photos and videos back from our photographers/videographer highlighting the beauty across the entire venue. We also really appreciate that the company running the venue sent many of the key staff members on trans awareness training so that we could have the most gender-affirming day possible. Thank you Westenhanger team!"
V347,The Castle Westenhanger,"This place is a gem and an absolutely stunning setting for special occasions. We had our daughter’s wedding there in June. The staff were attentive from the moment we first visited to look around, to the time we left having packed up everything the morning after the wedding. The food was delicious and generous portions the drinks were flowing. The castle is authentic and steeped in history which gives it a magical atmosphere."
V347,The Castle Westenhanger,"I can honestly say hand on heart that a typical ‘Wedding’ was not a bit of me. However, there is nothing Typical about Westernhanger.

The magic is created as soon as you walk in and even more so on my day as we had snow!! Transported into a winter wonderland with the most beautiful atmosphere and decorations.

The staff were honestly so incredible and I cannot even begin to thank you for guiding me through my day. You took everything out of my hands and I trusted you all. Your professionalism and expertise ensured that our day ran smoothly. Every single guest commented on how amazing the dinner service was and so professional. Also the food was stunning.

The evening DJ was great and although I took a turn for the worst, due to a sickness bug I couldn’t help but get up and boogie. The evening guests shared that the buffet was incredible.

On behalf of my Husband and I we would like to thank you all for creating and being a part of the most magical day. And if you’re anything like me and do not do ‘Typical’ this is the place for you. Westernhanger will always have a place in our hearts and we’ve made our own history in this incredible historical place."
V347,The Castle Westenhanger,"The team at Westenhanger were so warm and welcoming. We had travelled from up north to come down and looked at multiple venues. The castle was the only venue that we got emotional at. It is gorgeous. We had a huge numbers of friends and family travel down for the day, and many have said it's the best wedding they've ever been to. We did find that perhaps coordination was slightly lax for us, but that could be more of a criticism of ourselves. A really, really lovely team of people. Thank you!"
V347,The Castle Westenhanger,"Tania, Jackie and Bex are an absolutely amazing team. We had such a chill wedding day with everything running smoothly. The Castle grounds are beautiful and looked amazing in the October sunshine. The inside of the castle is perfect for the ceremony and the marquee is great for the reception. We really wanted photos in the dovecote and they turned out lovely."
V347,The Castle Westenhanger,"Westenhanger Castle is an absolutely amazing wedding venue! From the moment we set foot on the grounds, we were blown away by its beauty and historical charm. The staff at Westenhanger Castle couldn't have been more helpful throughout the entire wedding planning process. They went above and beyond to ensure that our special day was perfect in every way.

The team at Westenhanger Castle was incredibly accommodating, helping us with every aspect of our wedding, from selecting the ideal ceremony location to assisting with catering and decorating decisions. Their professionalism and dedication to making our day unforgettable were truly remarkable.

Our guests were also captivated by the beauty of the venue and the warmth of the staff. We received numerous compliments about the exceptional service and the incredible ambiance throughout the day.

In conclusion, Westenhanger Castle is not just a wedding venue; it's a fairytale setting where dreams come true. We couldn't have asked for a better place to start our journey together, and we are immensely grateful for the exceptional support we received from the staff. If you're looking for a wedding venue that combines history, beauty, and exceptional service, Westenhanger Castle is the perfect choice"
V347,The Castle Westenhanger,All the staff from start to Finnish and after are amazing. From enquiries to information and service. Spectacular venue. If you’re looking for honestly care love and so much more. This is the venue. No faults here. Food is wonderful. Would highly recommend!! Zach and jo
V347,The Castle Westenhanger,"From our first meeting, the staff were so welcoming, knowledgeable and responsive to any queries we had throughout the planning process. We had a lot of guests with dietary requirements, so the choice of menus was important to us when choosing a venue. There was a great selection of meals to choice from and the chefs were accommodating where we needed to tweak things!

The venue itself is of course stunning and a real stand out feature is the space for both the bridal party and groomsmen to get ready for the big day! All the staff on the day made sure everything went smoothly and we were able to relax and enjoy the day!"
V347,The Castle Westenhanger,"We cannot recommend The Castle at Westenhanger enough. Quite simply the best. A totally professional team who made our day so special. Everyone and everything was perfect and far exceeded our expectations. On top of this, the team really did make us feel more like friends than customers and really did seem as excited as we were about the day. From day one of planning to clearing up our things the day after, we were met with smiles and hugs and made to feel genuinely special. If you want good old fashioned professional service wrapped in the friendliest of company at a venue that looks stunning, then you have found the perfect venue in Westenhanger."
V348,Lympne Castle,"We couldn't be happier with how our wedding turned out. The venue is just stunning - a beautiful castle, lovely grounds, and overlooking the sea. We had a very small wedding of 15 guests, and we were treated like royalty. We had access to the full castle and spent the day wandering between different sections, enjoying every single one. The food (we had a BBQ) was delicious, and the staff were wonderful. It was all coordinated by Joy who was a pleasure to work with. She spent the day seamlessly coordinating everything behind the scenes, whilst looking after and playing with our dog which was such an appreciated touch! We stayed at the cottages on the castle and they were fantastic. Not only big and full of character, but it also made logistics so much easier having our guests at the location. The new castle bistro (the Naughty Dog) also meant everyone had a place to meet, drink and eat inbetween wedding events.

The best thing about the castle is that it caters for all types of weather. So no matter what you get on the day, you'll still have an incredible experience.

Finals things: the photos you'll get will be outstanding. What a backdrop! And the prices are extremely reasonable. We highly highly recommend this venue."
V348,Lympne Castle,"Great venue, beautiful and so many amazing comments from our guests. The different rooms and spaces made it more and gave the variety we wanted

The team also worked very well to be flexible with last minute changes to make it work and I can’t thank them enough for that

The views are stunning"
V348,Lympne Castle,"So we got married in the church (next door) and hired out one of the rooms in the castle for our reception.

I can’t fault the service. It was spectacular and really made our day special. I don’t think I’ve ever had service like that where the staff are so professional, personable and just amazing all round. We were aware that we didn’t hire out the venue or anything like that specifically for our wedding - it was a room in the castle so we didn’t really expect much. But the staff made us feel like we did. They even roped in some of the gardeners to pull smoke bombs for one of our pictures! The staff made every effort. Laura and Mike were great and went beyond expectations. We just have no complaints at all with anything. It was an amazing day.

The castle itself is picture perfect and for us was the perfect setting. It’s rich in history and the attention to details is incredible. There’s multiple rooms of varying sizes. We had a small wedding so hired out one of the smaller rooms but it looks like they can cater to a wedding of any size. We also stayed in one of the cottages within the castle grounds along with the guests which were equally perfect.

Pretty much every wedding I’ve been to the food has been mediocre at best. But the food here was great. Everybody really enjoyed the food. The kitchen obviously know what they’re doing so kudos to them.

This is honestly the best place to have your wedding. You’re in very safe hands with the staff here, the castle is gorgeous (and the views!) and the we couldn’t think of a better place to do it.

Thank you for the special day!"
V348,Lympne Castle,"Our wedding day was absolutely faultless from start to finish! The wedding team were so helpful and knowledgable throughout the planning process and our coordinator Dan looked after us for our wedding day - thank you Dan!
Lympne Castle is such a beautiful venue, and we can't wait to visit again once the castle bedrooms are ready!
Love, Sarah & Tom"
V348,Lympne Castle,"From start to finish, the staff at Lympne Castle were amazing. Professional, courteous, and incredibly helpful. We planned our own wedding, and although I feared it would become overwhelming, Kate made it so easy for us. The day came off without a hitch and everything was just beautiful, from the venue to the food. I am so grateful to all the wonderful staff, Kate and Mike, Joy, and all the sweet and charming servers. You made our wedding perfect!"
V348,Lympne Castle,"Lympne Castle could not have made our wedding day more special, it was a beautiful and intimate occasion from start to finish. We got to decorate the chairs as we liked and having the rooms to get changed in made it very easy in the end. The food was good and the staff very helpful, especially Mike and Laura. Everything was thought about and all ideas welcomed and accommodated where possible. We had the best day and would repeat it in a heartbeat to soak it all up again. The castle was a little bit of history that made the start of our adventure even more magical. Thank you to everyone at Lympne Castle."
V348,Lympne Castle,"Lympne Castle was truly perfect in every way. The Bridal Suite is stunning and was such a great space to enjoy the morning with my bridal party. We were lucky enough to get married on the lawn outside, the view is unbelievable and our guests were wowed! Our wedding breakfast was held in the Great Hall and genuinely felt like something out of a fairytale. The food throughout the day was amazing and the staff were so attentive and accommodating - especially our wedding coordinator Kate (we can’t thank you enough!!). I’d recommend Lympne Castle in a heart beat and our guests still talk about how magical the venue was - can we do it again please?! Love, Mr & Mrs J"
V348,Lympne Castle,"I could not imagine anywhere else more perfect for a wedding. It was our first and only venue viewing, we fell so in love with it that we booked a date there and then. We loved that our ceremony, reception and accommodation (we used the cottages) were all within the grounds plus the added bonus of the new bridal preparation room. We also had the benefit of Christmas trees and log fires which made our winter wedding particularly festive in the castle setting. The building and views are stunning - our guests were in awe! Aimee, our coordinator was first class in communications, expertise and ensuring the preparations and day ran to schedule. Nothing was too much trouble for her, even helping the grooms party with their buttonholes, a kind and personal touch. The staff were fabulous too and made us all smile with their lovely comments about our celebrations. The brilliant chefs offer an impressive menu, catering for all dietary choices and it is both delicious and beautifully presented. Lympne Castle had everything we could have wished for and more, it is a truly special venue, one of a kind."
V348,Lympne Castle,"Lympne Castle is the most perfect wedding venue. Not only is it absolutely stunning, has roaring fires, beautiful grounds and views but you get the whole venue exclusive which for us was a big bonus!

From the moment we booked it as a venue we were assigned a wedding coordinator - ours was Aimee and she was fantastic! Anything we needed she was super quick to reply and so helpful. We visited the castle lots and went to one of their dinner nights (which I highly recommend.) Our wedding day couldn't have been as smooth as it was if it wasn't for Aimee and her staff they made everything so easy for us and she even held my umbrella and helped me across to the church in the morning.

Everything that the staff do is perfect - the food is superb and the whole venue flows nicely for guests. If you are thinking of getting married here look no further or even for a party - it's a fantastic venue and you won't be disappointed."
V348,Lympne Castle,"well what can I say!! an amazing venue with fantastic staff. From beginning to end we were given so much personal service from everyone at the castle but Aimee was amazing!!! from small little touches around the castle to making me and my now husband feel calm before the big moment...Aimee must have had a Mary Poppins bag as she had everything we needed on hand from sewing kits to mints, scissors and glue and we couldn't have asked for a better day. Thank you for making our day so special ...even to the last touch of a hug goodbye this morning ."
V349,Chafford Park,Amazing venue for our wedding in the summer. Alicia and Sarah worked really hard to make sure we had the best day possible. Both the indoor and outdoor ceremony areas are beautiful and the main barn is a perfect setting for food and dancing. Couldn’t recommend highly enough.
V349,Chafford Park,"Chafford Park is a beautiful hidden gem in the glorious English countryside. From the moment we visited, we felt welcomed and really put at ease by the team and the family. The grounds are stunning, with so many opportunities to explore and capture our favourite moments!
With of having use of the two spacious barns to use we were able to really bring our vision to life, and the day panned out perfectly. The venue hire includes the day before your wedding to set everything up, and we booked to stay in the onsite accommodation in the Long Barn (a must!), which really put my nerves at ease knowing that everything was taken care of before the day.

Sarah and the team were extremely helpful, ensuring we had everything we needed for the day. All of our suppliers went above and beyond, the waiting and bar team were super attentive and great fun!

We had so many of our guests commenting on the venue, the service and the day itself, we just couldn't have asked for more.

We honestly couldn't have imagined our day being any better, we are still on a high from the entire day and cannot recommend this venue highly enough. Thank you so much!!"
V349,Chafford Park,"We knew we wanted to hold our big day at Chafford Park as soon as we first visited the previous spring. We always wanted a venue which was a blank canvas that we could put our own stamp on and it was perfect for this, with the two beautiful barns for us to dress and decorate for the ceremony and wedding breakfast and free reign on our choice of cater, but with a emphasis on trying to keep it local which we liked. The journey for the bridal party from the house to the ceremony barn is beautiful too, passed the pond and through the trees.

As we both work in events we loved having the bell tents as the backdrop for our friends to stay in and having the fire pits and festoon at night time gave the outside area a real festival feel.
It was also a big plus that we could stay on site for two nights - we legally got married on the Friday with a small group of family and friends and then cooked a big meal in the house that night.

Alicia and Sarah were helpful and prompt with any queries in the lead up and we’re very grateful to Charlotte who made sure everything ran smoothly for us on the day itself too.

We hope to return one day for a glamping weekend and to reminisce."
V349,Chafford Park,"We recently celebrated our wedding at Chafford Park, and it was an absolute dream!

The team's dedication to making our wedding unforgettable, from the initial planning stages to the last dance, the staff demonstrated a fabulous level of commitment. They took care of every detail, ensuring that our vision came to life seamlessly.

Our guests couldn't stop raving about the stunning venue. The charm of the barns, coupled with the picturesque surroundings, created a warm and romantic atmosphere that perfectly complemented our day. The natural beauty of Chafford Park added an extra layer of magic to our celebration, making the entire weekend feel like a fairytale. Waking up in the long barn was nothing short of glorious. The tranquillity of the setting and the connection with nature created a serene and peaceful atmosphere. It was the perfect way to start our journey as a married couple.

We loved having the use of two barns one for the ceremony and the other for our reception and the transition from one space to another was seamless, and it made the entire event flow effortlessly. We appreciated the thoughtfulness behind this arrangement, allowing us to savour every moment without any stress.

Our experience at Chafford Park was beyond our wildest dreams. If you're looking for a venue that combines natural beauty, thoughtful design, and a dedicated team, Chafford Park is the perfect choice."
V349,Chafford Park,"Could not recommend Chafford Park more. It is such a beautiful venue and the team are constantly improving and adding extra touches to the venue.

I loved the ability to chose our own caterers - I was able to bring in my African heritage by choosing an African caterer and it really made the day feel unique and special to us.

The sound system is unusual but once you are underneath it, it is great. We worked with a recommend DJ and saxophonist from Mint DJs who were really great and got the party started.

The added touch of having rooms on site for the family really made it easier. We were able to have a lovely family dinner the night before and able to enjoy the farm for the full three days.

Really was our dream day and we are so grateful."
V349,Chafford Park,"Where to start...what a beautiful wedding venue. So picturesque and relaxed. The grounds feel luxurious and private without losing the homely aspects we wanted for our special day. We knew when we looked at Chafford Park that it was the perfect place for our wedding. Sarah, Alicia and Catherine are an excellent team who have an eye for detail and really made sure we were looked after throughout the lead up and on the day. All questions are answered promptly and with care. The landscaped area around the stunning barns provide a perfect backdrop for photos and the barns made the most intimate space for our ceremony and reception. We are so grateful for the time and care to make our day so special. Highly recommend to go and view Chafford park and find out why it is just so special."
V349,Chafford Park,"Even though we had torrential rain on the day, Catie and Sarah made the day flow really well. All staff were incredible and so friendly. The grounds are incredible too. We wanted a laid back wedding with a slight rustic vibe and this delivered! Thank you all, I just wish I could do it all again xx"
V349,Chafford Park,"By far the most beautiful wedding location I have been to. The estate owners and staff were so professional and truly went above and beyond to make my sisters wedding the most special day of her life. Thank you Sarah, Alicia and the team! X"
V349,Chafford Park,"Despite the stunning facade of this venue, its owners and managers are incredibly rude, making planning and having a wedding at Chafford Park an uncomfortable experience.

On our first visit before booking, we loved what the venue offered and how beautiful it was. Sarah the owner was pleasant and kind and we consequently booked a week later.
However after booking, there followed 12 months of terrible communication, pulling back on previous promises made and generally being very uncompromising with our plans.
We didn’t feel Sarah or her daughter Alicia were on our side at any point and felt that they were more concerned about keeping their venue pristine than helping people have a beautiful wedding.

We had such a magical wedding day, despite them. Our guests and vendors contributed to an incredible day and I didn’t feel stressed at all. But behind the scenes, our catering staff and wedding coordinator were having to deal with so much hostility from the managers. They came in, in the middle of service to tell the staff that the kitchen area was too messy!! So incredibly rude and completely unprofessional. And this was only one incident amongst many that I heard post wedding where they were rude and disrespectful towards vendors and guests alike.

You are also obliged to partner with Wild Box to serve the drinks when you book this venue - they work closely with Chafford Park so essentially are almost as hostile. There are many things that you can’t do - put up your own decorations, bring your own alcohol or have a campfire past midnight. We luckily found our way around all of this but they made the whole thing so difficult and uncomfortable.

I would encourage anyone to not be lured in by the beautiful surroundings and look elsewhere if you want a more friendly and compromising service."
V349,Chafford Park,"We had the most amazing wedding at Chafford Park! It really is the most stunning venue, especially in June when everything is in full bloom. We really wanted as many of our friends to be able to stay with us across the whole weekend and this venue offered just that. The Glamping tents were a huge hit with our guests and the long barn where we stayed was beautiful (and perfect for getting all the girls glammed up on the big day!) Being able to access the venue from Friday morning until Sunday midday meant we could fully enjoy time with firends and family who had travelled so far to be with us.

Alicia and Sarah were so helpful, making sure everything was just as we wanted it and that the day ran smoothly. We couldn’t have pictured a more perfect place for our wedding and can’t wait to return for some more glamping in the years to come!"
V350,The Ferry House,"Where do we start with this review? Well, if you are looking for a venue that has practically everything this is it. The staff are fantastic, they were brilliant from the day we booked it and even after the event. They were helpful all the way through the journey and on the day the staff we great. Our guests had the most amazing time and all said it was one of the best weddings they had been too. Granted the weather helped, but a mild sunny day in April made it perfect. The food was 10 out of 10, really do recommend the upgrade on the menu choices and wine. The in house DJ was also excellent. In fact everything went to plan, there was nothing negative just the perfect magical day."
V350,The Ferry House,"We got married at the Ferry House last Saturday and had the most amazing magical day and that was all down to the incredible team at The Ferry House.
Sam & Chloe were our wedding coordinators on the day and they were absolutely faultless, the day ran perfectly and that was all down to them both.
The food was incredible and every one of our guests commented on how amazing the food quality was.
The rooms were super comfortable.
The venue overall was just incredible, we would highly recommend anyone getting married to celebrate here.
Thank you all"
V350,The Ferry House,"This venue is a hidden gem, we didn't know about it until we were looking at Venues and we instantly knew this was the place for us. Relaxed, rustic, caring and everything in one place! The venue itself is so warm and inviting with the log burning fires, rustic bar, barn and amazing surroundings. The team go above and beyond to make your day extra special.
The food selection is amazing, we had the hog roast which everyone commented on!
Thank you to everyone at The Ferry House, our day was amazing!"
V350,The Ferry House,"Our winter wedding at The Ferry House was just perfect, and that is all thanks to the amazing team. The care and attention to detail they had to understanding our vibe and making our vision come to life was just second to none. We have so many amazing memories of the day and also the planning stages. The setting was beautiful, the food and drink were amazing, and the staff were all super friendly.
All of our guests loved everything about the day and are still talking about it now.
Thank you so much for making our wedding dreams come true, core memory made!"
V350,The Ferry House,"Our special day tailored to our exact requirements, staff professional from original viewing to the day, cannot thank them enough, what they always say about a good place is the staff make the venue, and they sure do at the ferry house. Beautiful venue in picturesque surroundings worth every penny"
V350,The Ferry House,"The Ferry house is an absolutely amazing , our wedding day was magical .
Our guests all said what a beautiful venue .
The food is outstanding and all the staff are very helpful. From the first planning meeting up to the day of the wedding .
Nothing was to much trouble if I had a query they was always at the end of email .
Myself and the bridal party stayed at the cottages the night before , this really added to the excitement of our wedding day .
The rooms at the Ferry house are decorated to a high standard and are very comfortable. The food is amazing.
We would highly recommend this venue . Our wedding day was perfect ."
V350,The Ferry House,"I don’t even know where to start - the Ferry House was the perfect venue for our big day. Nothing was too much trouble and they made the whole planning process so easy. I have worked at weddings myself and know how venues can sometimes be difficult and reluctant to help with certain things but not the Ferry House!
They decorated the venue with my diy decorations without any issues, they answered my constant emails (crazy quickly!) and even put up with me doing everything last minute!
The actual day itself, they were so helpful, excited for us and just made us feel amazing!
The venue is just absolutely gorgeous - nearly every guest came up to us on the day to tell us how amazing it was and they honestly felt it was the best wedding they had been to! All thanks to the Ferry House. If we could do it all again we would both choose the ferry house again in an instant."
V350,The Ferry House,"We just wanted to say a huge thank you to the whole Ferry House team for all of their hard work, support, kindness and helpfulness in making our day so incredibly perfect. Our guests were so amazed, and keep telling us as much!

It wouldn't have been as wonderful without the team all part of it, and Josh was the best DJ! He played some absolute tunes. Owen took great care of everyone down by the firepit.

Chef and his team put out some absolutely incredible food, everyone has been raving about it since. The food was simply perfect, we're having roast dinner withdrawals at this point....

Katy took care of me and pampered me for six months in the run up to the wedding with the facials, definitely one of the best parts of wedding planning, she got rid of any worries in each session, I will definitely be continuing with those, I miss her already! They should be a must for every bride to be!

Maxine & Georgina, where can we start? They were both the most organised, reassuring, fantastic team, they were truly perfect, being the calming voices of reason, and helping move everything indoors in the morning.

We would write an essay about how amazing each and every one of the Ferry House team are. Every single one of the Ferry House team are truly one in a million, and TFH are very lucky to have them all."
V350,The Ferry House,"Our son has just been married at The ferry house.
From start to finish the staff and wedding team have been incredible!
The attention to detail, care and kindness of all the staff is the best we have ever received. They were simply amazing.
The venue itself, is totally worth the journey .
It was absolutely stunning and took our breath away when we saw it decorated.
We stayed overnight and the rooms were beautiful, clean and really comfortable.
Our buffet breakfast in the morning was delicious, full of fresh produce.
The food did not disappoint, it was the best wedding breakfast meal we have had.
Congratulations on a top star venue and a brilliant team of staff from the washing up lady to the wedding planners (Maxine was especially brilliant and also our assigned host who never stopped smiling despite our requests for this and that).
Thank you one and all for making Harry & Dan’s day totally amazing! We couldn’t have asked for more ."
V350,The Ferry House,"The best team of people you could ask for! Every single person we spoke with was so helpful and lovely to deal with. They made our day so special and run seamlessly! We couldn’t have asked for a better team!
The food and drink is the best around, locally sourced making it all taste so much better! And the views, away from everything so you can really soak in the day with your loved ones with no distractions!
Couldn’t ask for more"
V351,Hayne House,"I fell in love with Hayne House the second we went to our viewing and it only got better from there.
The pre-wedding process with the team at Hayne House was amazing, they were so accommodating and responsive and had answers to all the question that my Type A Bride brain threw at them. Throughout the planning process they were fabulous and it was so nice to find a venue where we could both get ready on site in the morning.
On the day, the Hayne House team (Beth) were absolutely fabulous. Beth kept me calm all morning and made me feel like we were in safe hands. We DIY-ed all our decor and Beth asked my input on the set up before the Groom turned up which really put me at ease. Beth also managed our ceremony music on a phone and it just made me feel so comfortable. Pre-aisle walk, Beth really helped me understand what would happen and really set my nerves at ease. The whole team were incredible and they made our day so so perfect.
We couldn't have asked for more. The venue is stunning and the team are amazing! I would recommend Hayne House to absolutely anyone! We also really loved the sustainability initiative, as we're both conscious of that, and that's what initially made us look at Hayne House. 100000% would recommend!"
V351,Hayne House,"We were married at Hayne House in August 2024, it was one of only 2 venues we selected to view at relatively short notice (we decided to give ourselves only 6 months planning time and were lucky they had availability for our chosen weekend!) - Sam was the first person we met and so welcoming. She really helped us imagine, in the cold of winter, how our summer wedding could be. We absolutely fell in love with the orangery from seeing the photos, but the reality was even better. Our key criteria was a venue that felt like a summer garden party, and you really got a sense of the lovely grounds by being able to see out to them all around you, even from inside the venue.
Becky gave us some great guidance throughout the planning, and Ella and team made the day run very smoothly.
6 months later, our guests are still talking about the beautiful relaxing day - it was everything we imagined - and better!"
V351,Hayne House,"Safe for the children to run around already beautiful so don't need to much decoration, staff couldn't of done any more on the day to help."
V351,Hayne House,"Hayne House was absolutely perfect.
The wedding Co ordinator Ella was so professional. She kept everyone calm and organised throughout the day. Would highly reccomend Hayne House as a wedding venue everything was fantastic!"
V351,Hayne House,"Hayne House was just the most perfect setting for our wedding. It’s private and beautiful surroundings coupled with amazing staff, food and suppliers - we couldn’t have asked for more or had a better day."
V351,Hayne House,We couldn’t have asked for a more superb venue and team! They made sure we had everything we needed on the day and we’re just so kind and helpful leading up to the wedding. They answered all our queries super quickly and the whole day just felt like a breeze!
V351,Hayne House,Hayne House is a beautiful wedding venue with a amazing team of staff! They supported us every step of the way and made sure everything ran smoothly on the day. They go above and beyond to make sure everything is perfect. I would especially recommend Hayne House if you have children as they are free to play the entire day! We had so many comments from guests about how beautiful the venue is and how amazing the staff are.
V351,Hayne House,"The team have curated a flawless operation at Hayne House which is so clear. The team ensured the day ran seamlessly and were amazing throughout the day and also during the lead up to our wedding which made it so stress-free and easy for us! There was not one thing that we needed to worry about on the day, the team handled EVERYTHING!! We had the best day and we're so pleased we chose Hayne House for our wedding, it was perfect!"
V351,Hayne House,"Had our wedding at Hayne House in June 2023- cannot fault a single thing with the team, services or facilities. Am so glad we chose Hayne House and would recommend to anyone wanting to get married stress free with a fantastic team who truly take the pressure off of wedding planning and are extremely flexible with requests and adjustments. Very good value for money and honestly all expectations were exceeded! Everything was well thought of and planned, there were no surprises and communication was excellent from the moment we made initial contact. Was such a special and memorable day due to the efforts and high quality of care and services at Hayne House."
V351,Hayne House,"As soon as we saw Hayne House we knew it was the perfect venue. The team are so welcoming and lovely. To the lead up to the big day they helped with everything. On the big day they may us feel at ease. I cannot recommend this venue enough, all of our guests said what a beautiful venue it is. They made our day so special, we enjoyed every little bit of it, thank you to all the team!"
V352,Bradbourne House,"My son had his wedding at Bradbourne House, the venue was beautiful, the staff were so helpful from start to finish, food was absolutely amazing, the toastmaster was a credit to the venue making this a day him and his new wife will never forget I would thoroughly recommend Bradbourne House for a wedding venue."
V352,Bradbourne House,"We had our reception here from the moment we arrived we were looked after and our guests were well informed. Hannah was fantastic and made our evening run smoothly and nothing was too much for her, she even helped me with my dress before my first dance and always asked if I was okay. Lauren was our first point of contact and she is lovely as is Rebecca. Thank you all so much. I would definitely recommend Bradbourne house not just for its beauty and privacy but for its team too."
V352,Bradbourne House,"On Saturday 27th October 2018 Julie and I had our renewal of Vows celebration at Bradbourne house, from our initial contact with Lauren at the Wedding Fair to the tasting menu to the day itself was a professional and dedicated service.

Bradbourne House has understood our requirements and ensured that the delivery of these were met without fuss or bother.

The food delivered from the Head Chef from Canapes to Wedding Breakfast to the Hog roast in the evening was first class.

The day itself ran like clockwork and the staff were again professional in their duties to ensure that all our guests were looked after.

It was a 5 star experience and we are already booking for our milestone birthdays in the next year or so.

A special thanks to Lauren and Head Chef who went beyond the call of duty to make it that special."
V352,Bradbourne House,"To all the fabulous staff and Bradbourne House, thank you so very much for your wonderful wedding organisation, wine knowledge, kitchen and food skills and ability to put on a great day as a team. You are all fantastic and a real asset to your employers. We are so very glad that we chose you as our venue. A no hassle and pleasant experience from start to finish. Wonderful! Thank you!"
V352,Bradbourne House,"From start to finish, Bradbourne House was wonderful in delivering the most perfect wedding reception for us. The house and gardens are absolutely beautiful and give you a great amount of space. What really made it was the staff. Everyone from the events team who worked with us for months beforehand, to the fantastic team on the day who thought of everything we hadn't and were there whenever we needed them. It meant we were free to enjoy the company of our guests and not worry about a thing. Perfect day and can't recommend it enough for a dream wedding venue."
V352,Bradbourne House,"To all at Bradbourne House.

Just a big thank you for making the Wedding of Paul and David such a memorable day. The venue was delightful and everything you did made it the most wonderful occasion. Everyone said it was the best wedding they had ever attended! The weather, the setting, the staff and the food was absolutely perfect.

So as the mother of Paul i thank you so much for a day to remember, it was absolutely flawless.
Thank you all again."
V352,Bradbourne House,Just a little note to say a big thank you for making our day run so smoothly. It all went perfectly for us and everybody was so complimentary of Bradbourne House.
V352,Bradbourne House,"To all at Bradbourne... thanks so much for making it a super special day for me and Emma. Your whole team was superb, especially Charlotte, and made the day very easy for us. We had so many nice comments from guests about the venue, the food and the staff. A few pics as requested!"
V352,Bradbourne House,"We just wanted to say a massive thank you to all of you and the fantastic team that helped make the day special!
The staff and service were all exceptional and nearly all the guests commented on the high standard of service and professionalism of your team. Food... Amazing!!

Thank you all so much. You took the pressure off before and during the wedding and delivered to us a day that no one will forget for a long time to come."
V352,Bradbourne House,"I attended Bradbourne House on Saturday 18th June for my cousin wedding.

I am unable to eat wheat/gluten so passed this on to the bride and groom beforehand.

I am just getting in touch to say how great your staff were at facilitating my needs! The food was delicious and they made sure it was gluten free for me. In the evening fish and chips and bacon sandwiches were being served. I was unable to have the fish as covered in wheat but a very kind gentleman brought me out two bacon sandwiches in gluten free rolls. This was very much appreciated. I was also advised the chips were gluten free!

Thank you for being so accommodating. It is much appreciated!"
V353,Westerham Golf Club,"We cannot express how grateful and happy we were with Westerham Golf Club. All of the staff were amazing and our event managers made sure we were always kept up to date and incredibly quick to reply (even though we bombarded them with our silly questions!) They made us feel so at ease and took care of all the little details they we didn't even think of! The food was delicious and they ensured that everyone was catered for. If you want a beautiful, seamless wedding experience, Westerham Golf Club is the place to book!"
V353,Westerham Golf Club,"Everything about this venue was just perfect. From our first visit up until our wedding date, the team at Westerham were so helpful and always on hand to answer any questions. On the day, the team had everything under control and the whole day went smoothly - not to mention the incredible views!"
V353,Westerham Golf Club,"We honestly cannot recommend Westerham Golf Club enough as a wedding venue! From the moment we first reached out to inquire, the team made everything so easy and stress-free. The events manager and the coordinating team were absolute professionals, and they went above and beyond to ensure that our big day was flawless.

Everything about the day was incredibly well-organised. From the ceremony to the reception, everything flowed so seamlessly. We didn’t have to worry about a single thing as the team had every detail covered. It was amazing to be able to relax and enjoy the moment, knowing that the entire team had everything under control.

The venue itself is absolutely stunning, with beautiful views and a warm, welcoming atmosphere. The level of care and attention the staff gave us was exceptional. The events manager was always there to offer support and guidance, and they were just so kind and approachable. The entire team worked in perfect harmony, and their professionalism shone through at every step.

Our guests had an unforgettable time, and I’m so grateful to the team at Westerham Golf Club for making our wedding day so memorable. If you’re looking for a wedding venue that offers top-tier service, incredible organisation, and a beautiful setting, Westerham Golf Club is the perfect choice!"
V353,Westerham Golf Club,"We visited many venues before deciding on Westerham. What stood out right away was how lovely and welcoming the staff were on that initial visit, they really made us feel like no question was too silly to ask. And of course the setting - we initially wanted an outdoors wedding but knew that there'd be the risk of bad weather, so it was important any outdoor venue would have a great indoor backup. With Westerham, you can't have an outdoor wedding, but the indoor setting, with wide open windows revealing the beautiful landscaped golf course in all directions, meant it was like an outdoor wedding anyway. And it was just as well because on the actual wedding day, there were quite high winds! The team there were so helpful and patient throughout the whole year of planning, and on the day itself. They really put our minds at ease and were really flexible with some of our requests. The reception rooms are great - the smaller one for the ceremony was just the perfect size for our 100 guests, and the larger room for the wedding breakfast and evening celebration was spacious with room to eat, to dance, and to sit to catch your breath. The golf course is a wonderful setting to go out and get your formal photos and some video shot. It's fun to take some of the golf carts up into the wooded area and a chance to have some private moments with your new spouse. It's such a beautiful setting, we would recommend if you can afford it to include some drone footage, for your wedding video because it allows such a great view of the course, the buildings and water features. The food was excellent, in particular the lamb shank, and such huge portions that we struggled to eat a lot later in the evening at the buffet supper. Well worth paying the small extra supplement to allow 2 menu choices plus a veggie/vegan option. They also managed a few tricky dietary requirements really well including Halal and some fairly unique food allergies. Our formal proceedings were capped off by a fireworks display out on the golf course which made for some amazing pictures and video and if you can afford it, we would recommend it. Many guests said it was their favourite part of the evening and a real surprise. We couldn't be happier with our decision to be married here and it's hard now to imagine us getting married at any of the other venues we looked at. You will have a wonderful day no matter what time of year or whatever your theme."
V353,Westerham Golf Club,Amazing staff and amazing place. Loved every minute of my big day. They put in all the effort in to your big day. They made sure the day was perfect
V353,Westerham Golf Club,"Amazing experience from start to finish!
Fell in love with the venue the day we went and viewed it! It was all we imagined!
Gracie was Amazing the whole way through until the big day for us!
I honestly wish I could relive the day!

The day from start to finish is all we ever dreamed off! And I couldn’t recommend this venue enough and the team!"
V353,Westerham Golf Club,"When we began our wedding venue search, our main criteria were:

- good proximity to airport for international guests
- ceremony and reception at the same place, without the need to exit / reset
- no preferred supplier limitations
- kitchen on site (no need to hire externally)
- natural materials, like wood and brick, barn aesthetic
- indoor space we'd be happy not to leave in bad weather
- can have live music with no formal noise limiter
- experienced & supportive team
- budget

Westerham Golf Club delivered all of this and so much more. As soon as we visited the venue for the first time and spoke to the team we were confident we found our venue.

We were assigned a contact person straight away who answered all of our questions by email and phone conversations and was always unbelievably helpful and quick to respond.

In the lead up to the day we met our wedding day coordinators who we were reassured were very on the ball. We had a lot of personal details and touches throughout the day and never felt that we had to remind any of the team about them, they all understood the vision and knew all the intricate details of the day. They delivered them all without fault.

The venue on the day looked absolutely stunning. The exposed brick and beams in the Valence Suite make this feel like a cozy but expansive barn conversion, but with the benefit of the adjoining rooms, wrap around balcony and excellent facilities of the golf club. The views are spectacular and the tree-lined drive up to the venue really sets a great tone.

Throughout the day everything ran like clockwork, guests commented that the food was incredible and all of our suppliers worked with ease with the staff and facilities.

The team set up all our personal and homemade things for us and packed them all away again for easy collection the next morning - we are so so grateful for this!

The flow of the space is fantastic, we had our ceremony in the Eleanor Suite, then did confetti outside before re-entering the main space where the drinks reception were laid out and musicians performing. The bar area, sofas, dance floor and balcony were perfect for the canapes and drinks reception. We had photos on the grounds as well as in the lovely rose garden at the front of the venue. The dinner set up was there from the morning and had a real wow factor when guests first saw it. While Eleanor Suite was empty the chairs were quickly cleared and this became a breakout space where we laid out board games and guests could relax if they didn't want to be dancing with the band.

We got married in November and had a lot of evening guests, so having a space with plenty of room, without anyone needing to go outside (in case of cold/rain) was key and the venue was perfect in this regard. In the end we had a lovely clear day and guests really enjoyed being on the balcony.

I hope this review is helpful in helping other couples choose their venue. For us it was a dream come true and we cannot thank the team enough for delivering a perfect day!"
V353,Westerham Golf Club,"The lead up the wedding was great, Ella helped us with any little questions and made sure everything was sorted!

The day before we met the on the day manager Brad who talked us through the whole day and made sure we were happy with everything. Also when we walked in one of our suppliers hadn’t done what they were meant to - and the venue got on the phone to them right away to come back and sort it meaning the stress was off me!

The day came and it was a blur, but everything went smoothly, my guests couldn’t stop complimenting the venue and how gorgeous it was. Every detail was perfect and the food was amazing! The wine choices were a big hit and I couldn’t be more complimentary of the staff.

The only hiccup we had was when asking for a cup of tea for my Nan during the welcome drinks, and my brother was told they can’t do that by the bar, but my groom went up and it was sorted quickly.

Thanks westerham for a memorable day - that we will cherish always"
V353,Westerham Golf Club,"Westerham is a beautiful venue. The backdrop of the luscious green golf course and the building itself is amazing. The rose garden is the perfect place for a drinks reception - even the drive into the venue is cool!

Now to come onto the staff. Every single one of them couldn’t do enough for us. The communication at every step was faultless, and they are extremely helpful regardless of who you deal with! They are professional and can accommodate a whole variety of things, for example we asked for halal meat and they sourced it without any issue, no extra costs or anything. Their recommended suppliers are great, and they really make you feel at ease throughout the whole process and on the day.

The food is also VERY good. All of our guests were complimentary of that, as well as the decoration and table layout which is rustic and picturesque.

Having the licensed ceremony room in the same venue was perfect, as your guests can simply walk through the door into the wedding breakfast and evening reception room! The bar is well stocked, the wine selection was well received by our guests too.

We really can’t recommend Westerham enough. A few of my friends who were there are now considering it for their wedding venue, it’s that good and I found beat all others on price too!"
V353,Westerham Golf Club,"We made the best decision choosing Westerham Golf Club for our wedding venue. The staff went above and beyond, there are so many photo opportunities on the immaculately kept grounds, and the food was stunning! We had so many compliments from guests on what a fantastic venue we had chosen. The team made the whole wedding planning experience really straight forward, and were always in hand to answer any questions we had. Couldn’t recommend Westerham Golf Club enough!"
V354,The Old Kent Barn,"I could not be happier than we chose to have our wedding at The Old Kent Barn. The care and attention to detail the entire team put into everything they do is unmatched. The venue is absolutely stunning, and so many of our guests commented on how incredible it was. The food was amazing - so filling, tasted amazing and looked just as good. We had Sam as our wedding coordinator and she went above and beyond to ensure we had the best day of our lives. I'm so grateful that we found this venue - as it provided us with the most unforgettable day. Thank you TOKB!"
V354,The Old Kent Barn,"We had our wedding at The Old Kent Barn and couldn’t be happier with our experience. Everything was incredibly well planned and organised from start to finish. The staff were professional, attentive, and genuinely cared about making our day perfect. The venue itself is stunning, with beautiful grounds and a warm, welcoming atmosphere. It made for the most amazing setting for our ceremony and reception. We felt completely supported throughout the planning process and on the day itself. Highly recommend to any couple looking for a seamless and unforgettable wedding experience."
V354,The Old Kent Barn,"We would just like to give a huge heart felt thank you to all of the team at The Old Kent Barn.

We had our special day on a sun filled day on 3rd January 2025 surrounded by all our family and loved ones.
Our wedding was brought forward with 6 months due to doctors advice to my wife.

They couldn’t of been more helpful. Helped us through every step of the way and guided us through the entire process.

This was an absolute god send to my wife who is regularly in and out of Kings College Hospital.
The team took all the stress and worry from us and were always on hand in with any questions.
They were absolutely awesome. They are extremely well organised and ensured everything went well.

Our fairy tale wedding became a reality and we owe this to all the team.

We’d like to give an extra special shout out to Chloe, our wedding co-ordinator. You were awesome!
If anyone is looking for a venue for their special day then look no further than The Old Kent Barn.

You made our fairy tale wedding a reality and we’ll be forever grateful to you all."
V354,The Old Kent Barn,Myself and my husband married at the stunning Old Kent Barn in October and had the best day of our lives. The staff were amazing throughout the whole process from securing a date all the way to end day after the big day. Our wedding coordinator in particular Claire was just amazing and so helpful and resourceful. We would highly recommend the venue to anyone!
V354,The Old Kent Barn,"We got married at TOKB and it was flawless from the very first moment we’ve signed to the wedding day itself.

The whole process was very smooth and they have thought about every little detail. Their portal is very comprehensive and they help you to plan your wedding and make sure you cover every aspect of your day.

They really do go above and beyond and they run the wedding almost military style (in a good way!). They make sure you are on track without being pushy. Everything is done seamlessly and in the background. You never know they are there!

The venue is fantastic and there’s very little you need to do to decorate. It’s just down to individual themes and table decorations. It allows you to take great photos as the venue and the gardens are beautiful.

The food was great. The portions were massive and it tasted great. You won’t be leaving the wedding being hungry.

All in all, they have thought about everything, including the tiniest details. Even at the end of the night, the have made sure that there was some evening food left for us in our bedroom.

We’ve had a great wedding at TOKB and we are very grateful to the venue and the staff for making it perfect."
V354,The Old Kent Barn,"I would recommend TOKB to every single couple out there! They are more than just a venue - the staff here cater to you as if you are family, and gave us the wedding day of our dreams! Each staff member goes above and beyond to ensure your day is perfect, and you get a wedding coordinator who basically ensures everything on the day goes smoothly. They took all the burden of the stress so my partner and I could just be present and enjoy our day. I’m so glad we chose the Old Kent Barn, as my partner and I know not every venue is as thorough and caring as them (from stories from our friends and family about their weddings). Thank you TOKB - we love you!!"
V354,The Old Kent Barn,We chose TOKB as our wedding venue and never once regretted our decision. They have been incredibly supportive through our plethora of questions and thoroughly looked after us from enquiry and beyond the big day. Every single member of staff works extremely hard - from grounds keepers to kitchen staff to bar staff to wedding coordinators - you name it! Nothing is too much trouble for anyone there as they purely want you to have the most special experience with them. I cannot recommend them enough!
V354,The Old Kent Barn,"The Old Kent Barn was the most perfect venue! From the moment my now husband and I went for our first viewing right through until after the wedding the staff at the venue have been amazing - Ashleigh was our wedding coordinator and could not have been more helpful and on the day she was an absolute star and went well beyond her role in helping do things to ensure the day ran smoothly. The venue is STUNNING and the staff set everything up for you so that you can have the most relaxed wedding morning! Our guests could not speak more highly of the food - it was delicious and the chefs team were really accommodating with special requests and dietary needs and allergies etc! My husband and I had the most special wedding day and I highly recommend The Old Kent Barn, you will not regret choosing this as your wedding venue!"
V354,The Old Kent Barn,"We got married at the Old Kent Barn this week. From the minute we first enquired, to the tour, booking, planning, and wedding day were all perfect and so well organized. The staff all go above and beyond and we could not have been any happier. They make the planning process so easy, and we're always there is we needed assistance. The venue is gorgeous, so well maintained, the gardens especially are always being worked on and are gorgeous, we especially loved the pond and ducks!! I would not have changed a thing. The food was brilliant we went for a BBQ and had SO many compliments from our guests, the canapes, deserts and evening food were all amazing as well. Thank you so much for making our day perfect."
V354,The Old Kent Barn,"A week on from our wedding and I’ve come to the conclusion that there are no sufficient words to describe our experience at the barn.
From the minute we booked, the team have been brilliant. They are so responsive, they never leave you waiting for an answer when you email. They are positive, supportive and, most importantly, kind!

I have listened to the podcast ‘The Unfiltered Bride’ for most of the wedding planning and they encourage booking a ‘day of’ coordinator as wedding venues don’t provide the support you need. I can promise, with all my heart, you do not need one at TOKB. I had worried that we’d made a mistake not booking one, but boy did they prove me wrong.
They had at least two people checking on us throughout the morning as well as someone else for my husband, who helped with ties and getting them ready. Yes they were there to coordinate everything from the venue POV, but I did not feel ignored or that I was missing an extra person to help. They were on hand to help get me into my dress, to make sure my bridesmaids were ready. If you listen specifically to episode 74 of ‘The Unfiltered Bride’, everything listed during that episode as something a ‘day of’ coordinator does, is everything the team at TOKB did.

The food at TOKB is sublime. We had the hog roast for wedding breakfast and pizza for the evening. Our guests loved everything about it all, including the canapés. They took all dietary requirements we had in their stride and no-one went hungry.

I could gush about them for hours, they really are excellent."
V355,Leez Priory,"I never in my life thought I would get married in a place like Leez priory! The whole experience from start to finish was just fantastic. The price breakdown was manageable and there was no pressure to take any upgrades offered. The things we got in our package were phenomenal and having a wedding planner was tremendous - our lady (Leanne) was an absolute god send!
They catered to all our needs and we were made to feel so comfortable and nothing was a problem! I’d highly suggest going to an event there before hand, just to get a feel of what it’s like full of people and enjoy their delicious food. We actually enjoyed their entertainer ( singer) so much we hired him for our wedding ☺️
Lee priory is just so beautiful. I can’t speak highly enough x"
V355,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory on the 7th of September 2024. Considering how long they have been a wedding venue, they were pretty flexible with some of the ideas we had for the venue styling that turned out amazingly!

The staff really made the day something special and couldn't have done enough for us. Special mention must be made for Leanne, our wedding planner, who was amazing!

Highly recommend the venue and the incredible team that helped to make our day so special!"
V355,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in October 2024. This venue is stunning both inside and out with immaculately kept grounds and interior. The hospitality in the lead up to and on the day of the wedding was fantastic. The food was also brilliant. Another great perk of this venue is the amount of on site accommodation.

A couple of drawbacks / experiences during our wedding. There are only a few toilets in the main building which kept blocking and overflowing throughout the evening which led to us taking some guests to the dressing room or honeymoon cottage to use the facilities. You are also restricted by the venue on any external food or drink suppliers and the venues optional extras for this are quite expensive for what they are.

That asaide, we had the best day and evening at Leez Priory and would certainly recommend it!"
V355,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in August 2024- great venue and experience from initial viewing to leaving the morning after the wedding. Leanne acted as our wedding planner and was friendly, professional and helpful throughout. We opted for the classic package and the food was amazing quality with everyone commenting how full they were!
The venue is beautiful with several options for ceremony both inside and out. Accommodation was great too. The whole day ran smoothly with perfect weather - we will have very happy memories of our day!"
V355,Leez Priory,"Perfect venue and very attentive staff, lovely food and great communication from start to finish"
V355,Leez Priory,"Stunning venue. Fantastic Team. Very accommodating toward our unique ""surprise"" strategy. Our guests were truly surprised. Thank you."
V355,Leez Priory,"Leez priory was the 1st and only venue we looked around when we started planning our wedding. From the moment we stepped on the premises, everything just looked so perfect and exactly what we wanted from a wedding venue. When we got assigned our wedding co-ordinator Rachel, she was just absolutely spot on with everything we asked for and nothing was too big an ask for her. She made sure the day ran as smoothly as possible and took care of any issue that arose without me knowing (which I am forever grateful for!!)
The rest of the staff were amazing and very helpful.

The venue itself is just absolutely stunning and we loved that it has the pub area as well as the dance floor so it catered to all of our guests.

All of the rooms were lovely and it was so nice being able to stay in the fisherman’s lodge onsite the night before the wedding.

We genuinely cannot recommend this venue enough and it was 100% worth the money! 10/10!"
V355,Leez Priory,"We got married on a Tuesday in October to maximise the value of what we could get for our money; and honestly, we got everything we wanted and more. Leanne, our Wedding Manager was perfect at bringing an attention to detail and seamless organisation to the big day, and in the lead up. There wasn't one moment of the day where we felt stressed, as Leanne had it covered. In one particular instance, our flowers for the bridal party's hair hadn't arrived. Within five minutes of telling Leanne that we needed this, the flowers were with our hair and make-up suppliers to add the finishing touches.

Leez Priory as a venue is the most stunning setting, and offers an incredible range of areas in which the ceremony and reception can take place. There is also the opportunity for the bridal party to make use of the Fisherman's Cottage the night before the wedding, and for people to stay in the on-site accommodation on the evening of the wedding, making it the perfect venue for people also travelling from further afield.

Leez Priory were very accommodating, welcoming and were happy to work with us to make our day as perfect as possible. The food was incredible, and a total hit with all of our guests, and so many people have commented on how incredible the day was as a whole. You wouldn't be disappointed to choose Leez Priory."
V355,Leez Priory,They catered to our every need. To when we would ask for things they hadn’t been done before they still made sure it went smoothly. Leanne was amazing she made me feel so comfortable from the start. The whole day was stunning. Beautiful venue please go view it as you will not be disappointed
V355,Leez Priory,We got married on the 26 May 2024. This venue was absolutely brilliant! They catered for every need and made sure there was no stress on the day. Leanne was kind and level headed throughout and was always one step ahead! Do not hesitate to book- do it now!
V356,Chilston Park,"It’s taken me a while to write this review because it’s hard to put into words how magical my experience with Chilston Park has been. We originally came to Chilston on a whim knowing they had a wedding fair on. The drive up to the hotel is stunning, we were then greeted by Jane, the loveliest and most helpful bundle of joy, Jane became our wedding co ordinator and held my hand every step of the way, we went to every wedding fair from booking last February until our wedding day New Year’s Eve just gone and every time the staff made us feel like family that was visiting. On our day, unfortunately, Jane couldn’t be there but I knew the whole wedding team by then and had no worries that the day would go swimmingly with the amazing Ella, nothing was too much, nothing was answered with no and potential issues were resolved by the time I heard about them. Ella went above and beyond to ensure our day was flawless. Matt, another wonderful human who made it his business to make sure all guests were fed and watered, completed tasks that arose with the biggest smile and again nothing was too much to ask. Multiple guests commented on the efficiency of the staff and great attitudes. We have since been to a sister hotel of Chilston and it really goes to show that everyone can have the same training but the staff truly make a hotel, Chilston is second to none. The venue speaks for itself but these words are for the team because everyone bounced into work, got excited to see us and made us feel like royalty. Paul is clearly a great manager to his team, an absolute asset to Handpicked hotels and a lovely smiley face who even came in on his day off and wished us well. If you’re reading this and looking for a venue, book it, you won’t regret it! We had exclusive use which was great value for money for what it included. The best experience, the best team and the most beautiful venue x"
V356,Chilston Park,"We were so pleased to have had our wedding at Chilston. As soon as we saw the venue, it felt right for us. Its a beautiful venue inside and out. The staff are all excellently trained. From the reception staff, through to the waiting team, through to our wedding coordinator - everyone we met was excellent. We got married off site at a church and were delayed getting back to start our reception at Chilston, but the team were so flexible and made it seem no bother at all. We had such a wonderful day and are looking at being able to go back and stay and Chilston for our anniversary!"
V356,Chilston Park,"We couldn't have asked for more with our wedding at Chilston Park. From the initial booking to the details meeting and then finally the wedding day, everything was pretty much seamless. The wedding day itself went like clockwork and the staff worked so hard to make sure that everything was in place and everyone was in the right place at the right time! All of our guests loved the setting, the food and thought the staff were wonderful. We had a truly wonderful wedding day and that was thanks to the team at Chilston Park/"
V356,Chilston Park,"We viewed lots of potential wedding venues but from the moment we arrived at Chilston Park we just knew it was the place we wanted to hold our wedding. Chloe Rees guided us through the different room options of where we could hold our wedding ceremony as well as have our reception, no question went unanswered and the hotel was very accommodating in helping us deliver our two day dream wedding. Chloe, Paul The Manager and all the staff were fantastic from the start and on the wedding day. Chef, Ali delivered exquisite food for us and our guests, with friends and family still praising it months after. We have been back a few times for afternoon tea and evening meals with all the staff greeting us with such warmth. We have no hesitation in recommending the Chilston Park wedding team and this stunning country setting."
V356,Chilston Park,"Olly and I just wanted to extend our thanks to everyone at Chilton Park for making our wedding on Friday 7th of March 2025 it was so incredible.


Sophie was the first person we spoke to and she made the booking process seamless. She was so helpful in ensuring everything was arranged before her holiday and we are incredibly grateful for her.

The day before the wedding, I had the pleasure of meeting Ella and Ellie, who went above and beyond to assist us. They were both attending our wedding and were genuinely amazing. Ella made our day so special—she took care of everything from cutting the cake to moving things around, so we didn’t have to worry about a thing. She was truly outstanding. Ellie, working behind the bar, was equally fantastic, always with a smile on her face and everyone absolutely adored her.

We can’t thank them enough for making our day unforgettable. Even the morning after the wedding, when we came down for breakfast, Ella was there to greet us with a big smile and get everything ready for us.

Olly and I are already looking forward to returning to Chilton Park when our little one arrives. What a wonderful way to start March!

Thank you again to everyone at Chilton Park, and we hope to see you all again soon.

Best wishes,

The Yeomans!"
V356,Chilston Park,"We got married at Chilston Park in August, and it was nothing short of perfection. We opted for the exclusive use package, which catered to every need. Most of our guest list were international guests, and being able to host everyone comfortably under one roof for the full weekend was incredible. From the food to the helpful staff and gorgeous grounds, I highly recommend choosing Chilston Park for your wedding if you are looking for English elegance. Thank you to the full team who made our dream wedding weekend possible! Big shout out to Sophie for helping us plan for over a year and a half!"
V356,Chilston Park,"We honestly couldn't have wished for any more.
The professionalism and attention to detail was immaculate.
Even though we were a small wedding we were never made to feel less than anyone else."
V356,Chilston Park,"We have just had our special day, and all I can say is from the moment we looked around to the day after the wedding we was well looked after, we had a designated person to speak about our wedding and all our needs were met with no questions asked. The venue and the grounds are stunning, the bedrooms are beautiful and our day was so perfect, I couldn’t fault anything. I just wish we could do it all over again. I would highly recommend Chilston Park as a wedding venue."
V356,Chilston Park,"If you are considering Chilston Park Hotel for your wedding venue let me put your mind at ease.

We got married in Chilston park hotel on the 14th January 2024 and it was the best day of our lives. All our guests are still messaging and calling us telling us what a fantastic time they had, how beautiful the ceremony and the venue are, how through the day they were never hungry and that the food really was amazing.

Although the venue may be second to none it was the staff for me who really make this venue special, the attention to detail is exceptional. From the moment we attended the venue for an open day Jane our event organiser was amazing, Jane always made time to speak to us and communication was always very prompt and very accommodating where she could be. Jane really made the whole process very easy and stress free even with only having a year to plan it all.

On the day of the wedding the team at the venue were nothing short of exceptional. Matt was our point of contact on the day I approached Matt early that morning with a few tasks and like a mind reader had assured me everything had already been taken care of. The day ran faultlessly, it became clear from the beginning of the day that the staff have it down to a fine art which allowed us to just enjoy the day.

I cannot commend or recommend this venue highly enough, thank you again to Jane and Matt and all the staff at Chilston Park Hotel for the day of our lives."
V356,Chilston Park,"Excellent service, made our wedding day a really special memory. Beautiful food, always willing to help us with advice and effort throughout our day. Would recommend for no fuss professional and enjoyable day."
V357,Eastwell Manor,"My husband and I got married at Eastwell Manor in October 2024, and it was everything we dreamed of and more. From the moment we arrived, we were swept away by the breathtaking grounds, the elegant manor, and the warm, welcoming staff who made us feel like royalty.

The entire day was simply magical. The ceremony setting was so romantic – full of charm and character – and the reception felt like something out of a dream. Every detail was perfectly taken care of, and we didn’t have to worry about a thing. The staff were so friendly and helpful, and they truly went above and beyond to make sure everything ran smoothly.

We can't thank the Eastwell Manor team enough for making our wedding so unforgettable. If you’re thinking about getting married here – do it! It’s the most magical, romantic, and beautiful venue you could ask for.

With all our love,
Mr & Mrs Clarke 💕✨"
V357,Eastwell Manor,"My husband and I married here in April 2024. The venue was stunning and guests were impressed with their rooms. The toast master Jim is highly recommended. He really brought the energy into the wedding.
Highly recommended."
V357,Eastwell Manor,"We got married in August 2024 and we had the most stress-free and beautiful wedding. It was raining on the day and our Plan A was for the ceremony to be outside, but on the day it had to be changed to Plan B. The Eastwell Manor team handled the change of plans with such ease, I didn't have to worry about a thing and the end result was better than our original plan! The wedding coordinators at Eastwell Manor are incredibly organised and professional. Jim, the Toastmaster, is an absolute delight and really brought the crowd together. The food was excellent and the tent outside was beautiful at night. We had a beautiful day and are eternally grateful to the team at Eastwell manor for looking after us so well. The rooms are stunning to stay in and the bridal suite is absolutely gorgeous to get ready in with your bridesmaids."
V357,Eastwell Manor,"We would like to say a massive Thankyou to Eastwell and their fantastic team which made our wedding day truly special and unforgettable!
From the first visit we knew Eastwell was the perfect venue for us, from the great layout of the venue to its fantastic facilities, beautiful rooms and ceremony spaces.
The wedding team were all amazing, professional and so friendly and nothing was too much trouble.
Everything organised quickly yand efficiently through email and were always very accommodating and flexible.
We really appreciate everybody’s hard work which made our day the best of our lives!"
V357,Eastwell Manor,"After getting engaged on my 40th birthday, we decided we wanted a Christmas wedding and wanted to plan it within a year. We had Eastwell Manor as one of our venue choices and after viewing it in December 23 (when it was decorated for Xmas) we completely knew it was ‘the one!’. Throughout the year of planning, Dawn and Helen were amazing. Responded to emails etc quickly, helped wherever needed, and it was lovely to have a menu tasting session in a private room. I stayed in the bridal suite the night before. A few of us had dinner in the bar which was very relaxing. The room/suite was beautiful. The bath was amazing (see photos) and I had a lovely morning getting ready for the day ahead. Our wedding was so special. To be surrounded by our guests in such a fabulous venue so beautifully decorated for Christmas, it was magical. Everyone said how great it was. The food taste delicious and was presented well. All the staff were so friendly and helpful. My husband and I stayed in the bridal suite that night and it was just great. I would 100% recommend this venue. Id also recommend a Christmas wedding as the atmosphere is something else. Thanks again Eastwell Manor, Dawn and the team, you are amazing 🤩 Love Mr & Mrs Smith (22.12.24) 🎄 xx"
V357,Eastwell Manor,"We got married at Eastwell Manor in May and honestly, it was the perfect day from start to finish! The venue is absolutely stunning — the grounds, the house, everything just felt like a fairytale. The staff were incredible and made us feel so relaxed and looked after the entire time. They really went above and beyond to make sure everything ran smoothly. The food was amazing, the setup was beautiful, and all our guests were raving about the whole experience. We couldn’t have picked a better place to say “I do”. Massive thanks to everyone at Eastwell Manor — you helped make our day so special and we’ll treasure it forever!"
V357,Eastwell Manor,"We visited Eastwell Manor when looking for venues and instantly fell in love with it. The grounds are so impressive and the inside very homely and comfortable. The wedding team are extremely helpful and professional and helped make our day perfect. The rooms are all lovely, particularly in the manor house and all guests were very happy with them. Particular thanks to Helen, Dawn, Tracey and Chris for the lead up to our big day and for coordinating our day so well without any issues. The food tasting was amazing and had a real personal touch and the food was very well executed on the day with no delays and again our guests have been saying how much they enjoyed it. Our toastmaster Jim was fantastic and also ensured our day went perfectly. Thank you to all of those behind the scenes in the kitchen and the efficient staff who assisted with the wedding breakfast and bar in the evening. Would highly recommend this venue."
V357,Eastwell Manor,"Really lovely venue, the whole day went really smoothly and big thanks to Jim who did an amazing job MCing and corralling the crowd when needed. Really made the day run smoothly, everyone had an awesome time."
V357,Eastwell Manor,"After postponing our wedding and even losing our original venue due to Covid, we knew that finding an alternative that we loved just as much was going to be tough. Eastwell Manor is every bit as beautiful as the photos suggest, and after visiting, we knew we’d found the perfect place for us immediately.
The Maid’s Garden fit our dreams of an outdoor ceremony perfectly with its ivy-lined walls, manicured lawns, pond and Italian gazebo. The terrace with its views overlooking the endless grounds was the ideal space for our reception drinks and canapés, especially on a blue-skied day in June. The wood-panelled Rose Garden Room made the perfect setting for an intimate wedding breakfast with 80 of our closest friends and family. The room was transformed for the evening reception with fairy lights (put up very kindly, and at short notice, by the venue staff) candles and a DJ, with the neighbouring Chaucer Room serving as our bar and a slightly more relaxed setting for our guests. During the evening we also held a barbecue on the terrace as the sun went down with plenty of food for everyone to enjoy.
It’s worth adding that with so much accommodation available in the Manor House and Mews, it really had the feel of a destination wedding. Friends and family were able to stay on-site for a long weekend, giving us the chance to celebrate with them the night before and all enjoy the fabulous spa facilities the day after.
We can’t emphasise enough that all of this was made possible by the outstanding team at Eastwell Manor, who literally could not have done anything more to ensure that we had the best day of our lives. They really did go above and beyond and made us both feel as if the entire hotel was our home for the day. This extends far beyond the exceptional wedding and events team. From the bar and waiting staff always happy and willing to help, to the reception staff that were on-hand at all hours and the incredible chefs that served the best wedding food we have ever had (our guests still talk about the beef!). Helen and Jasmine were a dream to work with, being flexible with all of our requests and doing everything they could to make sure that all of our ideas were realised on the day. A special mention has to go to Chris - an absolute asset to the Eastwell team, he worked tirelessly to ensure everything went without a hitch on the day, and all while looking cool, calm and collected. You really are in excellent hands with this team!
We cannot thank the whole team at Eastwell Manor enough, they gave us our dream wedding day and we wholeheartedly recommend them to everyone!

V357,Eastwell Manor,"We had the best day! The team are amazing and can’t do enough to help. A special thank you to Helen for all of your help to plan our big day, Chris for all of your hard work on the day and Jim, the toastmaster, who was absolutely brilliant and looked after all of our guests. Harry and Olex also looked after us throughout our stay.
Everything went like clockwork from start to finish, with wonderful food and great rooms.
We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this beautiful venue."
V358,The Barn,"I can not recommened this venue enough! From start to end they have been so helpful and accommodating. Phillippe & Janet made our day so special, we wouldnt have changed a thing. The staff were wonderful, they decorated the venue better than we could have imagined, the food was delicious, the DJ was amazing and all our guests commented on all of these things and more.

V358,The Barn,"Thank you so much for such an amazing day, food was fabulous, over the moon with how things went"
V358,The Barn,Wow!! As soon as I visited The Barn I knew it was the perfect venue for our wedding and I was right! Our day was absolutely perfect and everything went so smoothly thanks to every one at The Barn! Everyone made you feel so comfortable and nothing was ever too much for them! They set up the venue exactly how I had visioned it and all the guests loved the food! We love going back now for a drink or food and they are always so welcoming still!
V358,The Barn,"Amy & I celebrated our marrage at the barn which couldn't have been better.

The staff were very friendly and extremely organised, going out of their way to make sure everything flowed effortlessly.

This put us both and our guests at ease to enjoy every moment."
V358,The Barn,"I cannot thank everyone at The Barn enough for making our wedding day the best day of our lives. It's hard to put into words how perfect everything was. From start to finish every detail was well thought out, every change of plan and sudden request was catered for and throughout you knew you were in safe hands. The venue is beautiful, staff are incredibly friendly, polite and helpful. Food and drink is amazing. The list goes on and on. All I can say again, is Thank You. Cannot recommend highly enough!"
V358,The Barn,"We recently had our wedding at The Barn and from the moment we contacted Philippe we couldn’t have asked for a better experience. With only 4 months between booking and event it was great that communication and planning with Janet was easy, flexible, timely and supportive – from our plans with various music playlists needed on different sound systems to arranging our rehearsal the day before, all the little details were accommodated.

The location of The Barn is really accessible being in the centre of town, with plenty of places for guests to stay nearby, yet it feels very private as it is set away from the main road down a private street with no passing traffic. It is a gorgeous venue, really intimate but with plenty of space for our 70 guests, and the team had done an excellent job of setting up and laying out our table decorations beautifully; it was a wonderful space for us to connect with our guests.

All the staff were professional, friendly and helpful throughout the event; many of our guests commented on how lovely they were, along with how fantastic the venue was.

The food was delicious, guests choose from 4 meals on each course, and every one of them looked amazing, we’ve heard many compliments of every option. Service throughout the meal was excellent, a good level of attentive, efficient and unobtrusive, they served a large room at a good pace.

The whole running of the day was done smoothly, changing areas worked really well, we hardly noticed the hard work going on downstairs while we had our meal.

We can’t thank the team at The Barn enough for helping us have such a wonderful day and we highly recommend this wonderful venue!"
V358,The Barn,"There’s no words to describe the barn or their team. If you haven’t already booked a wedding with them, do it, and don’t think twice!

Philippe and Janet are amazing, from our initial emails and queries, through to the booking and the meeting to discuss our options etc. We were presented with a lovely folder containing all of the information, and some sample menus - given plenty of choices to give to guests (allowed up to 4 of each for adults, and 2 of each for children - loads more flexibility than a lot of other venues)

We dropped off our decorations the day before, and it’s lovely to see local businesses working together to support each other and the area (they supply discount codes for local hotels), and the Hotel were happy for us to leave a car in the car park overnight before.

When I arrived at the venue, the team had decorated it just how we wanted it, with all of our name places out, activity packs, favours etc.

Nothing was too much trouble, we had vegetarians, coeliacs and allergies - all the food was impeccable. Every single person commented on how great their sea bass was, or how tender (and huge!) the rack of lamb was, it’s safe to say they catered for everyone (gluten free ice cream, gluten free bread rolls etc). Even catered for a vegetarian child at short notice !

Their house DJ (Luke Swift) did a great job too, keeping the music flowing and people up on their feet - a real crowd pleaser.

The bar staff, were incredible - smiles all round, enjoying the day as much as we were - making it extra special.

The sweet cart, patisserie selection and cheese tower looked great too (even supplied gluten free crackers for that too)!

Philippe, Janet, Andrew, Jack & Toby (and the rest of the back of house team), thank you so much for making our day so memorable, every single one of our guests said how great they day was, and you’ve even secured a few new restaurant customers (from as far as Greenwich) who are coming back as they want to taste the other food options 😂!!"
V358,The Barn,"We had our wedding here in November & ourselves & all of our guests had the best day. The staff were nothing short of amazing, so attentive & really couldn’t do enough for you. The food was brilliant, everyone said how they enjoyed every course & the evening buffet too! You got to choose out of a big list per course, so you could give your guests 4 options per course to choose from which is very very rare with wedding breakfasts! It really is such a beautiful & intimate venue with exceptional prices. They decorated it perfectly, exactly how we imagined. We dropped 5+ boxes off the night before & a description of how we’d like everything & the staff did it perfectly. Not one thing was wrong. We had outside suppliers for a couple of decor/sweet Cart items who failed to turn up, I found out as I was about to walk down the aisle so was upset and stressed. The Barn staff, especially Phillippe, sorted everything and to my surprise in the evening we had a stocked sweet table decorated downstairs for us & our guests, they really do go above & beyond for you. We have no complaints or reservations at all about this venue & would 100% recommend it to everyone. The ceremony room looked so pretty too, with the chairs covered & the pretty twig trees, we didn’t need any more decor in there than that, the orangery is such a pretty room on its own. As is the rest of the venue with gorgeous wooden beams, it can suit all sorts of wedding themes. Thank you to everyone at The Barn for making our special day, the best day ever!"
V358,The Barn,"Patrick and I had our wedding reception at the Barn on the 31st July 2022 and we could not have chosen a more perfect venue for our special day.
On viewing The Barn, we both instantly fell in love with this beautiful venue which is also in such a perfect location in the centre of Tunbridge Wells, so convenient for our guests, many of who would be staying in nearby hotels. Having a smaller wedding, we were also thrilled that we could have the exclusive use of the venue for the whole day which later proved to add to the relaxing atmosphere of the occasion.
Philippe was so friendly and helpful in guiding us with our choices which made everything so much easier and ensured all ran smoothly on the day.
Throughout the process, Janet was amazing too and always answered my questions promptly, nothing was too much trouble.
Like many couples who get married here, we had our photos taken in Calverley park, which is just across the road from the venue, again so convenient as we did not have to leave our guests for too long.
The food was delicious, and we had many compliments, it was also wonderful to be able to offer our guests individual menus from the various choices available, a feature I would not have previously thought was possible. The welcome canapes and the evening buffet were also very well received.
Luke Swift, the resident DJ, was great too and kept the dancers on their feet.
We are so pleased that we chose The Barn for our wedding and can not recommend this venue highly enough. We thoroughly enjoyed the day and all our guests had a fabulous time.
Dear Janet and Philippe, we so appreciate everything you did to make our day so special and one that we will always remember.
Thank you so much,
Christine & Patrick x"
V359,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","The best choice we made was having our wedding at the oak barn frame farm! Not only is the space gorgeous, but it's eco friendly, has lots of different options depending on preference and weather, and they have beautiful cottages for family and close friends to stay close and the option to spend the whole weekend at the farm! It was exactly what we were looking for! And the best part was the support! Chrystelle was amazing!! She helped us through the whole planning process and gave us the invaluable list of suppliers( who were all amazing!). She is such a professional and a wonderful person! She really went above and beyond making sure we had the best day (weekend) of our lives! Couldn't recommend this place more! If you're looking for a country wedding, you've found your place!"
V359,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","We had our wedding in October 2024 at the Oak Barn Frame Farm and we couldn’t have picked a more perfect venue! From the moment we looked around the barn, we both knew it was the place for us. Having 3 barns meant we were able to keep our 50 guests entertained and still have beautiful spaces. We weren’t sure what to expect with dry-hire, but the barn is so beautiful it could be kept minimal if you’re on a budget, but being able to personalise it to how we wanted it made it extra special for us. The open fields, waterfall and sheep meant we got some amazing photos (from our photographer Matt Birchall) as well as the best memories. Chrystelle couldn’t have been more helpful, from her communication in planning, to the materials provided in the run up to the wedding, and her excellent organisation on the day meaning our wedding ran seamlessly and we didn’t have to worry about anything. The list of trusted suppliers was great too, and we used quite a few who were also great. The accommodation on site was an added bonus for us and family, and all of our friends and family commented on what a perfect venue we’d chosen. Being environmentally focused was also a huge bonus for us, as it really aligned with our values. Thank you to all at the Oak Barn for giving us the happiest day!"
V359,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","It was an absolute joy to have our wedding at the oak barn - we had the most perfect day! The team were so responsive and helpful throughout the process - we loved working with Hayley and Chrystelle!

The spaces were all beautiful and a perfect balance of indoor and outdoor in case of rain! We had so many compliments on the venue throughout the day.

We loved how much we were able to personalise the venue - from setting up the wedding breakfast decorations from scratch to bottling up our own homemade cocktails to serve throughout the day. The onsite accommodation was spotless and felt so luxurious. It was fab for all our nearest and dearest to be so close and turned it from a day to a weekend of celebrations! Thank you so much to the oak barn for making it all so special!"
V359,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","We recently had our wedding at The Oak Barn and it was the perfect place. The barn and surroundings are absolutely beautiful, the fact you can spend the whole weekend there really makes the wedding feel special with plenty of time to set up and relax.
The team are amazing, really supportive in the run up and during the weekend and ready to help with whatever might arise!
Thank you for the best weekend ever."
V359,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","I cannot thank Oak Barn enough - you made everything absolutely PERFECT!!!

Thank you for your constant eye to detail, for keeping us in line and for your creative flare.

You managed expertly to make us all so relaxed on every level. Throughout this entire process you have been so diligent, always going the extra mile and always suggesting the most fun ideas - you really made all my dreams come true.

With our greatest thanks,
Chris and Alice"
V359,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","I honestly cannot stress enough how beautiful this venue is and how amazing the staff are. From the day we went to view the venue (and fell in love the second we drive down the drive) to the moment we left the day after our wedding the staff were always on hand for anything we needed. It’s great having the cottages on site as well, being able to stay the night before our wedding and the night of made life so much easier for us meaning we could get everything done the day before the wedding and I didn’t spend the morning stressing if everything was right. This venue is truly stunning and has so many different places for gorgeous photos. Thank you again Tim and Deana for allowing us to get married at your amazing venue. Emma and Elliot"
V359,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","It was great being able to stay from Friday till Sunday which made us all feel way more relaxed than trying to do everything in a day!
The three barns are wonderful each with its own unique charm and thing to offer.
The cottages were beautifully set out and offered us and our wedding party top end accommodation."
V359,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","From the first visit of the Oak Barn, I knew it was where I wanted to get married and it did not disappoint!
The booking process and the final details meeting run so smoothly, all of the staff are extremely helpful throughout they provide you with so much information to make your organising of the wedding so easy!
We booked Oak Barn for two nights along with Weavers Cottages, it was the best thing we did… our guests were able to settle in the day before and we had everyone round for drinks and nibbles the night before making our wedding so much fun! The cottages are so comfortable with every detail thought of… waking up to the sheep in the fields is just perfect!
Chrystelle was the best, she made sure we was happy at all times and made sure everything run so smoothly even appearing during my sons tantrum (toddler) in the middle of the ceremony with cookies to calm him down. After being awake in the middle of the night replanning our ceremony to be outside due to the fact I had both of my brothers giving me away and also how lucky we were with the fantastic weather!
Both members of staff who were there on the evenings to lock up the barns were so helpful and friendly and made it so easy for us!
The Oak Barn really is the most special venue, it is absolutely stunning down to every little touch! The memories we will have from the perfect wedding here will last forever for both us and our guests! Thank you to everyone at Oak Barn for making it so special!"
V359,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","From the moment we drove down the drive for the first time, until approximately six months later when we said I do, we knew this was the venue for us. We were blessed to have unexpectedly beautiful weather for April, the presence of the young lambs adding to the atmosphere and just the perfect day from start to finish.
We hired the venue for the weekend, to enable our wider family and guests to be part of our celebration and it really did take a huge amount of stress out of the actual day. The cottages are welcoming, of a high standard, and provide all that you need, although never did get to experience the copper bath!
The whole team are hugely supportive, encouraging, making you believe that anything is possible. Each wedding feels individual and personal, limited only by your imagination. We would whole heartedly recommend the Oak Barn and its recommended suppliers."
V359,"The Oak Barn, Frame Farm","We made the ultimate mistake of visiting this venue first when starting to plan our big day - no where else compared.

The views (& sheep!), the beautiful barn & Byre (a choice of indoor or outdoor ceremonies), well furnished cottages for all to stay & just a the perfect feel for a wedding.

They provided a list of recommended suppliers who have worked (& are trusted) at their venue which gave us a great starting point although they were more than accommodating for anyone new.

Very helpful in the run up in the day with compiling a complete run through of the day - with floor layouts, supplier details (& got in contact with each supplier on our behalf to ensure they were equipped with all the info for the day). Even on the day, Tim was great at resolving any small hiccups that appeared.

Huge thank you to Tim, Deana, Chrystelle, Tembo & all the behind the scenes team for making our day so special."

V361,Channels,"No words could describe how beautiful and stunning Channels Estate is. Right from the very start of viewing Channels all the way to our wedding day, we were made to feel comfortable. The communication was absolutely amazing and they helped make our day a very special day. Katie was our coordinator, she was kind, sweet and helped us make our day one to remember. We would highly recommend Channels Estate

Mr & Mrs Edwards"
V361,Channels,Katie made our dream come true. She was attentive and organised which made the running of our day feel so smooth and organic. The venue itself is stunning and luckily we had nice weather which just made the day even better. Everyone loved the food and the service was excellent. Couldn’t have asked for more.
V361,Channels,"Channels provided a great experience throughout. The team (led by Karen) were extremely helpful throughout - they accomodated all of our needs, worked well with the suppliers and coordinated the day brilliantly. Venue was set up beautifully and food was of a high standard. On site hotel rooms were luxurious and reasonably priced for our guests. Would recommend the venue without question."
V361,Channels,"We got married 31st March 2023 at channels, from the moment we booked channels Karen and her team were incredible, communication was great all the way through. Our actual day was fantastic from morning till night Karen and all the staff were helpful, friendly and just couldn't do enough for us and our guests! Would highly recommend channels"
V361,Channels,"Wedding Day - 9th April 2023
Couldn't be happier with the venue and how our wedding day went, Karen and the rest of the staff were brilliant and took care of everything for us and always made sure we were alright and that it all went perfectly. They were lots of fun and we couldn't recommend them highly enough. Thanks!"
V361,Channels,"The venue is stunning, food is beautiful. And the staff are welcoming happy and seriously can not do enough for you.
Nothing is too much.
Can not rate this place enough."
V361,Channels,"What a perfect day we had, marrying at The Channels Estate. A couple of months before our wedding day, our wedding co-ordinator needed to be changed. We were handed over from Molly to Katie, and the handover couldn't be smoother. Both Molly before, and Katie once handed over couldn't have been more helpful. A couple of weeks before our day I began to have bride jitters about the planning and organisation of decoration etc. Katie replied to my email very quickly, putting my mind at ease.
On our big day, Hayley and Karen couldn't have been nicer and more helpful. Hayley single handedly tidied the outside area before our ceremony as it had been left quite a mess from the previous wedding the day before, and Karen was on hand following the ceremony with the electric swatter to deter any wasps after the Pimms! Every member of staff we spoke with was lovely and did all they could to ensure we had the most wonderful and calm wedding day. Channels is a beautiful venue, I just wish we could do it all again! Thank you all :)
Jasmine and Dave x"
V361,Channels,"I am a little late in writing this review as we got married in September 2021. It truly was the best day ever and we are so glad that we chose Channels for our wedding day. We knew it was the venue for us, from our first visit where we met with Paul and he showed us around. The venue had everything we wanted, a beautiful barn, great grounds and lots of gorgeous accommodation, which was a must for us. We stayed the night before in The Retreat, which was amazing, with lots of room for us to get ready and although the weather was not on our side, and we could not get married in the ceremony garden, in the end it didn't really matter. Molly was our coordinator and she was incredible. It was like she could read my mind, and everything was exactly as we wanted, without us even having to think about it. The day went by in a flash and the venue looked amazing. We didn't have to think or worry, it all just happened seamlessly. The staff worked so hard and the food was amazing. All our guests had the best time and were so complementary about the venue and they loved the accommodation. It really was perfect the day. The best part is that, as it's not just a wedding venue we can visit again if we want to and book to stay in the hotel for our anniversary. Also must not forget to mention James who works at the hotel. He must have rearranged our accommodation booking so many times and was so kind and helpful. We had to postpone by 6 weeks due to a member of our immediate family becoming temporarily ill. James, Paul and Molly were very understanding while we tried to rearrange our wedding day to work with all our guests and suppliers. 10/10"
V361,Channels,"Wow! What can I say?! There are quite literally no words to explain how wonderful channels is. From start to finish, Paul, Eleanor and the whole team could not have been more friendly and accommodating. They took our vision and made it reality without breaking the bank too much. Every single element was perfect from food to decor to operation. It was faultless. Everyone adored the food and said just how beautiful it looked. Thank you to the most wonderful team! We appreciate you so much!

If you’re considering channels…….just do it!"
V361,Channels,"Channels staff were fantastic both in the planning of the day and organisation on the actual wedding day, we couldn’t fault them. Staff were friendly, helpful and proactive. The wedding day was amazing and so many people commented that it was the best wedding they’d been too.

We planned our wedding for what turned out to be during the pandemic. Channels were so proactive, responsive and helpful with rearranging our day, and even helpful with our wedding insurance claim for the rearrangement.

It’s a stunning venue with plenty of outside space. We’d thoroughly recommend it :)"
V362,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"Firstly Christie and Sarah the Wedding Coordinators were so friendly and couldn’t do enough for us on and before our wedding day! They were so approachable and personable. The staff at Greenwoods were all so friendly, helpful and genuinely cared about us having the best wedding day it was so very appreciated! All of the staff, from the maintenance and support staff right through to the management went above and beyond to make our stay and wedding the best experience. One lady cleaning our room went out of her way to help us with getting extra towels and bits we needed on my wedding day. Another gentleman who served us for breakfast also went above and beyond to upgrade us to a better room because our TV and electric went off in our bridal suite and they wanted us to have the best experience, which was such a nice touch and honestly made our experience so much better! Cannot fault the place! 5 stars!!!"
V362,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"Everyone has commented to me how gorgeous our wedding venue was and they aren’t lying.
Service was second to none, every staff member in that building treated me like I was a celebrity throughout my stay there for our wedding and I will never forget it!
Special mention to Shannen who looked after us thoroughly throughout wedding planning
Love Mr & Mrs Stam

V362,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"We got married at Greenwoods recently and I all can say is wow and thank you!!

Our day ran perfectly and that’s solely down to the staff here - some of who were working all day - but even by the end of our night, nothing we asked for was too much trouble.

The food was outstanding - we had many guests comment on how great it was especially seeing as they were catering for 100+ guests - it didn’t feel like a typical ‘large event’ meal but something you would expect in a restaurant.

The venue is perfect, beautiful grounds and a stunning garden suite and there was no stress for my husband and I as everything was looked after, the staff clearly have a lot of experience in weddings as they were there and ready for the next part of the day before we were!

I couldn’t recommend Greenwoods enough to any couples thinking of choosing it as their wedding venue!

Thank you again!"
V362,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"Cannot put into words just how perfect this was. 2 night stay plus wedding ceremony, reception and evening. The attention to detail was fantastic. Venue stunningly beautiful. Food was lovely and service very good. Wedding coordinator was excellent. It really was just perfect"
V362,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"Perfect venue for a perfect wedding.
The whole day ran like clockwork and nothing was too much trouble for the staff team as we were gently directed throughout the day. My niece looked beautiful and happy as she walked up the aisle in the lovely gardens.
We had a brilliant time and at the end of the day an extremely comfortable bed.
Thank you so much."

V362,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"It was faultless from the moment we arrived to the moment we left.
Great rooms, more than pleasant staff (who bent backwards to accommodate the six of us plus two children under 5 ) the wedding, the wedding reception, the food and then the great breakfast in the morning
I would highly recommend this place !"
V362,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"This is a gem of a place which deserves much wider recognition.
Don't usually write reviews but felt compelled to break my code of silence for this experience. My daughter chose Greenwoods Hotel & Spa as her preferred choice of venue for her wedding reception.
From the moment she and her entourage arrived at 7.30am on the day of the wedding the staff could not have been more helpful. The level of service and attention to detail were exceptional. Shannon, the hotel's wedding co-ordinator, was on hand throughout the day and evening giving re assurance, confidence and updates on timings and procedures which is what you need on days like these. Such a cool mature head on young shoulders!
Food and silver service at the wedding breakfast were impressive and plenty of bar staff on hand throughout the evening so none of those unseemly 'scrums' ever developed at the bar for drinks; and the Garden Suite function room literally takes your breath away when decorated.
Overnight accommodation did not disappoint and breakfast plentiful.
So if you are planning a wedding put Greenwoods on your short list. You won't regret it."
V362,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"We recently got married at Greenwoods. From start to finish it was a perfect experience. The Library room was stunning, the reception room was beautiful. Nothing was ever too much trouble. All the staff on the day were happy, helpful and brilliant. The food received constant compliments - it was delicious!!!!
As a very nervous bride I wouldn't have been without Shannen - our wedding coordinator. She was simply amazing - made me feel relaxed and really special - i just loved the care and attention. The whole day went without a hitch and Shannen and the team even delivered beautiful sunny weather! We are so so pleased we picked Greenwoods for our wedding. We cant wait to head back for a stay on our anniversary! Thank you everyone!! love, Michelle and Jon xxxx"
V362,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"Chris and i would just like to say a huge thank you to you and all the staff involved in making our wedding the best day of our lives. The day ran so smoothly and that is all thanks to you and the amazing team at Greenwood’s. So many of our guests have commented on the day from how beautiful the venue was decorated, to the delicious food and the friendly staff.

The day completely surpassed our expectations and we we cannot thank you enough for making it the most special and amazing day of our lives.

Thank you again,

Chris and Helen"
V363,Crondon Park,"In terms of the beauty of crondon park you can see for yourself...

But the care of the people that work there were unbelievable. Honestly, nothing is too much for them. You are paying a lot to get married (anywhere!) but somehow most people still feel embarrassed to ask lots of questions or things they don't understand. Crondon never made us feel bad for asking questions and clarifying things, asking for adjustments and just being reassuring.

They were so helpful on the lead up, everything was clear and on the day they were faultless. I'd definitely recommend them to anyone!

We had 103 guests so on the higher side and it was still plenty of space.

The food was also incredible!"
V363,Crondon Park,"It was an amazing day! The place looked stunning.
Thank you for your hard work. You have made our special day incredible"
V363,Crondon Park,We had the most special day! I honestly do not think I could have changed a thing!! We were so well looked after for the entire day
V363,Crondon Park,"We had an absolute fantastic day, everything ran smoothly and staff was so helpful and friendly. Jo our front of house was lovely and helped us throughout the day, even when my veil needing securing she was able to help. We would highly recommend Crondon Park, our day was so special and would love to do it all again xx"
V363,Crondon Park,"My partner and I first visited the venue after getting engaged back in February 2023. We were greeted by Kara, who was nothing short of friendly and supportive. It was one of the first venues we had seen and booked the next day.

The process towards the big day was excellent. We would regularly be in contact with Ellie who would also answer any questions or queries we had. The communication was always quick and reassuring. We came to a few afternoon tea and special dinners they organise to get more of a feel for the place and we knew we had made the right decision.

As for the big day itself on 12.4.25, well it was absolutely perfect. Our front of house Jo, was nothing short of amazing, professional, friendly and went above and beyond what we expected. Thank you Jo! The food was absolutely delicious, the service was impeccable. A big thank you to all the chefs, waiters, cleaners and anyone else who was involved behind the scenes to make our big day so magical. The rooms were also amazing for our guests, as well as the Lily Suite, that me and my friends stayed in the night before. And of course, the honeymoon suite too.

We cannot thank Crondon Park enough for making our wedding so special. If we could do it all again, we would. Who knows maybe a renewal of vowels one day? :D

We would highly recommend this venue to any couple. 5 star service from start to finish. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you Crondon Park! The big day and experience will be cherished in our memories forever."
V363,Crondon Park,"I would like to say a huge thank you to the team at Crondon Park for making our wedding the most amazing smooth-running day. And a special thank you to Kayleigh and Kara, it truly shows how passionate you are about your Job.

Having our wedding at the beginning of December, Crondon Park had already had their Christmas touch décor up, the sun going down early made the fairy lights extra magical.

From the moment we booked the team were very attentive and reliable at getting back to emails throughout the months leading up to the wedding. I’m a big believer that communication is the key, and they had made everything stress free. They met our every need and went above and beyond to accommodate our requests.

Our guests are still talking about it until this day, the food had high compliments, even heard it was the best brownie they had ever tasted!

No words can explain this day in a nutshell, but I will say, if you are considering booking this Venue for your special day, then please do not hesitate!

V363,Crondon Park,"We had the most perfect day, thank you so much for everything.
It was just amazing! Every one of our guests constantly said what a beautiful venue it was. We both really appreciate all the hard work everyone put into not just yesterday but over these last 2 years."
V364,Villiers Barn,"I don’t think the words I’m trying to find even exist in the dictionary, to describe this truly breathtaking, spectacular, unique, initiate venue - VILLIERS BARN is out of this world and that’s all down to Juliet & Barry, the Venue owners & directors & their son Jonathan who offer a 7-star, first class service. All three are extremely passionate about their business & they go above and beyond from the moment we viewed, booked & then had our wedding (last Thursday), no job was too big for them.

We viewed VILLIERS during its renovation & as soon as we drove up the lane, there was something so very special about where we had just arrived, historic, traditional - but different from any other typical barn wedding venue I’d seen online / been to as a guest. VILLIERS holds something special & unique.

VILLIERS was the first & only venue we viewed - we knew it was the one for us. We went back to see progress & it just kept getting better and better. I can’t praise the venue, the setting, the owners & staff enough.
We had an Amalfi (Italian) Coast themed wedding, the barn is simply stunning & speaks for itself - our theme fitted in perfectly, but as would any other theme over the last year I’ve seen villiers host many weddings & no two weddings have been the same it’s incredible - versatile VILLIERS! 👏🏽

Every time we viewed VILLIERS after booking, I felt so choked in the ceremony room, the barn, by the lake as I just knew this was the only place I see myself getting married to my fiancé, our wedding day was perfect & we have had fabulous comments from family and friends - saying it was the best venue & best wedding they’d ever been to, spectacular settings & top class service and so well organised.

To Juliet, Barry & Jonathan and their wonderful staff - your passion shines through & we can’t thank you enough for having us & making our day perfect, I’m so sad our wedding day is over - but the memories we’ve created will last forever & will play out like a film in our minds.

I can’t recommend VILLIERS BARN enough, if you want the best wedding, then book the best venue.

Thank you all again,

Harriette & Charlie Blackshaw-Clare 🤍🍋💙"
V364,Villiers Barn,"Where do I even begin with this beautiful venue?! From the very first visit to Villiers Barn, we knew this was the venue for us! The whole family were super friendly and helpful when showing us around after the first viewing we were hooked and knew we had to have our wedding here!

Throughout the whole year Jonathan was especially helpful with all the communications, questions and on hand to help with anything, nothing was too much trouble!

When it came to the wedding day everything happened with such ease, Jonathan, Becky and Ellen were on hand and made the day super smooth including the help setting up the venue making it perfect!! They gave us the wedding day of our dreams! It couldn't have been more perfect and everyone was so attentive in getting our drinks, taking us where we needed to be, the food was INCREDIBLE also and will be dreaming of that for a lifetime! Also the new seating area outside with the log heart is a lovely touch!

I couldn't recommend this venue highly enough and can't thank everyone at Villiers for the most memorable day!"
V364,Villiers Barn,"5 stars is not enough. We got married here on 22nd March 2025 and from the moment we booked the whole team were so responsive and helpful. The whole day went so smoothly thanks to the incredible team. A big thank you to you all for helping set the venue up exactly as we wanted and talking the time to ask questions where needed. The food was delicious and the portions were perfect, we received comments all day long from our guests saying how much they enjoyed all the food and drink on offer. The venue itself is absolutely stunning. Neither ourselves or our guests wanted for anything all day long as the service was outstanding. Truly thank you for helping us have one the best days of our lives."
V364,Villiers Barn,"We got married in Villiers Barn on November 7th 2024.

The minute we viewed the barn back in September 2022, we knew this is the place we were going to say ‘I do’.
Juliet, Jonathan and all of the team that work at Villiers are absolutely incredible!
2 years of constant communication, answering any questions we had and just checking in on us, this made our countdown even more exciting!

The BIG day arrived and we couldn’t have asked for anything more. The day ran smoothly and I would even say perfectly!
Jonathan was incredible, letting us have our time we needed, checking everything was okay and when we wanted to do certain timeline of events if we were busy talking to guests (or even dancing away), there was no pressure.

Not forgetting the Venue & grounds are stunning in itself & with the amazing team you’d be silly not to book to have your wedding here!

I’ve told everyone it was the best day of our lives and it truly was! Thank you for making our day amazing, I will never forget the dedication of the team for making our day so special and personal to us. 🤍

Shaun & Ellice
Mr & Mrs Baker"
V364,Villiers Barn,"Villiers Barn is an absolutely stunning wedding venue with so much rustic charm! From the moment we booked, the team went above and beyond to make everything perfect, and Juliet in particular was incredible—so helpful, kind, and attentive throughout the whole process. The food was fantastic, fresh and beautifully presented every detail felt thoughtfully planned. If you're looking for a beautiful, welcoming venue with a brilliant team, Villers Barn is the perfect choice."
V364,Villiers Barn,"Wow where do we even begin?

We got married at Villiers Barn in December & it was truly our dream venue. After visiting a few venues in Essex & Suffolk (which hadn’t ticked all our boxes), Villiers was the last venue we visited & wow we did save the best until last! The venue itself is gorgeous and suitable for any wedding across the seasons. The venue has a mix of a classic/rustic feel but also really modern and elegant. We fell in love as soon as we saw it. Juliet showed us around initially & we fell in love with her too!! She is so passionate about what she does & cares so much about you, making you feel so welcome! She makes you feel so special and taken care of. We loved that Villiers is also a family run business & knew this was the venue for us.

We really can’t fault the Villiers Barn Team.…Jonathan was BRILLIANT at providing information and responding to all our questions over the two years we spent planning. His replies were always so quick and this was honestly so reassuring for us, and made us feel like we were in very safe hands. He arranged our taster evening for us (which we highly recommend) where we essentially had a private dinner date at the venue, tasting the food options. He also helped arrange any visits we wanted at the venue in the lead up.

Becky helped us to set up the day before our wedding & also co-ordinated the wedding day for us with Juliet. We can’t thank Becky enough for all the help, support & love she showed not only us but all our bridal party and guests. She went above and beyond to make sure everything ran seamlessly for us (along with the rest of the Villiers team we had on the day).

The day itself ran so smoothly, with all our guests complimenting us on how beautiful the venue was. Even in the storm, wind & rain, the venue is just beautiful. We also had such delicious food that came out piping hot - all our guests were raving about how good the food was throughout the day.

At the end of the wedding day, we stayed in the honeymoon lodge accommodation which was so convenient & so lovely waking up the next morning with breakfast already prepared for us.

We really had the best day and are so grateful to everyone at Villiers Barn! We can't thank you enough! We really hope we get to visit again as guests for a wedding in the future.

Lots of love from Mr & Mrs Stanway xx"
V364,Villiers Barn,"Villiers barn wedding venue will always hold a special place in our hearts after our big day on 25th October 2024

Jonathan was so supportive, helpful and had so much knowledge whenever we needed guidance whilst planning our big day. We also met Jonathan’s mother, Wife and sister who were equally helpful if needed.

As soon as we see the venue we fell in love and knew we wanted villiers to host our special day. The venue has a really warm feel to it. The grounds and barn are spectacular and the attention to detail was out of this world

We cant thank everyone at villiers enough for helping make such a special memorable day. We loved every second."
V364,Villiers Barn,"From the moment we went and visited the venue, we were in awe of how beautiful it is.

Still, that means very little without a wonderful team, and Villier's Barn delivers in spades. Jonathan, Juliet, Becky, and everyone else we've dealt with were unbelievable.

From Jonathan answering our millions of questions as we approached the big day, to Juliet being so warm and helpful when dropping off our assorted decorations, to Becky literally putting on buttonholes right before the ceremony, we couldn't have asked for a better experience.

Everything ran smoothly, the staff were helpful throughout the day, and nothing was ever too much trouble. My wife and I are genuinely a little sad we can't do it all over again!"
V364,Villiers Barn,"Villiers Barn was the first and only venue we viewed. It was absolutely breathtaking from the minute we viewed it. The staff were very warm and welcoming. We then booked it and throughout the whole process nothing was too much trouble for the Villiers Barn Team. They did an amazing job on the day of our wedding and met and went above and beyond our expectations and we are extremely grateful.
The biggest of thank you's to Juliet, Jonathan & Becky.
All our love Richard & Chanel x"
V364,Villiers Barn,"Where do I begin? Villiers Barn was the only venue we viewed. To when my Fiancé proposed and I found the venue through my photographer I knew I’d found the place I wanted to get married in.

From our viewing with Juliet, we signed on the dotted line there and then. Jonathan was then a constant communication path for my 1000s of questions over the next 3 years. If I could give 1000*s I would, Jonathan was our rock! He would answer every question, provide every detail, no request was to much trouble and I genuinely felt so calm throughout the whole process.

The family team at Villiers care about your wedding day as much as you do, you’re treated like royalty & your guests will have the most incredible day. Down to the morning of the wedding Becky was just amazing, making sure me and my bridesmaids had everything we needed. To the ceremony and day when Jonathan had everything coordinated. My glass was always topped up, food was served by the masses and was incredible. Our music played through out the day and the little moments we had in our honeymoons lodge for some time to ourselves was so special. Jonathan and his wonderful wife & partner made sure everything was packed for us to ferry away the following morning, they even arranged special gift we received while staying at the lifehouse spa after the wedding.

I want everyone I know to get married at Villiers so they can experience the most incredible day as we did.. and of course catch up with our Villiers family.

Thank you again for absolutely everything, words simply aren’t enough. All of our love always Samantha & Adam xxxxx"
V365,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"Amy, Vicky and Laura were absolutely amazing throughout the whole process of my wedding, the planning, the lead up and the day itself. Nothing was ever too much trouble and they were always very quick to respond to any queries we had.
The staff at The White Hart are amazing and made me feel very calm and comfortable while getting ready for our big day in the amazing bridal getting ready room, which was one of the highlights of the day as there is so much space for everyone with make-up artists and hair stylists etc meaning there was zero stress.
The food was great all round, we had a meal the night before, the wedding breakfast and breakfast the day after were all just amazing, cannot fault anything with it.
Honestly the best day of our lives, so glad we choose this venue to get married, we would highly recommend to all!!"
V365,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"From the moment we booked our wedding at The White Hart, Laura was nothing short of exceptional. She not only helped us arrange every detail but also provided us with fantastic recommendations for photographers, entertainment, transport options, and venue decorators. Her communication was always swift and thorough, and she answered every question we had, making the entire process seamless from start to finish.

On the wedding day, our heartfelt thanks go to the wedding coordinators, Vicky and Amy who ensured everything ran smoothly and took the time to review every minute final detail with us a week before the big day. They managed every aspect of the day from start to finish, making sure everything was perfect. They both, along with their staff assisted guests with check-ins and helped (early - considering a late finish) with breakfast the following morning—going above and beyond in every way.

Thank you also to Luke and Bradley, for their incredible support. Luke, in particular, made my wife feel like the most important person on the planet. His care and attention was extraordinary, making my wife feel like she was the only bride to have ever gotten married at The White Hart. For also, calming me on my walk up to the venue, thank you. The personal touch he added to the day for us both made it truly unforgettable.

I’d also like to offer a special thank you to Vicky, who provided me with much-needed emotional support on the morning of the wedding. She was there to reassure me, address my concerns, and help calm my nerves—exactly what I needed before greeting guests, sat anxiously waiting for my arrival followed by my Niamh's arrival.

As someone who was feeling a little anxious leading up to the day, I couldn’t have asked for a better team of professionals. With them running everything, we were in great hands. Our wedding day ran exactly how we envisioned it, and it was nothing short of perfect! From the management to the chefs and waitstaff, every detail was thoughtfully taken care of, and it was the most magical day of our lives.

A huge thank you to the entire team for making our day not only flawless but incredibly special. We truly couldn’t have asked for more & we will regularly visit for a the extraordinary food and drink on offer.

All our love & support,

Ryan & Niamh X"
V365,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"We had our twighlight wedding on 19 October 24 and everything about it was perfect and magical. The staff were fantastic in terms of planning and on the day, nothing was too much trouble, particular mention for Laura, Vicki and Amy 😊"
V365,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"We just had our wedding day at The White Hart and all I can say is EXCEPTIONAL! from the day we booked Laura was always on hand to help us and answer any questions we had about our day or the venue. So attentive she even worked late to help us secure a new DJ after issues with our original one. She went above and beyond through the whole planning process. She is a calming influence and incredibly organised and professional which is just what you need when planning a wedding. OUTSTANDING SERVICE! Additionally the front of house staff on the day were all incredible and made everything run seamlessly throughout the day and late into the night. Vicky and Amy, you two were amazing! We can’t thank you enough for making it even more perfect than either of us could have imagined. You are all superhero’s and I’m so impressed that even the tiniest of details and planning were followed exactly as I had asked. I can’t thank you all enough. If you are planning to get married and want the confidence of knowing your venue and it’s staff have your back and will make your day exactly how you picture it then look no further than The White Hart! Best venue ever! ❤️❤️❤️"
V365,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"Got Married in July 2024, from start to finish Laura our wedding day coordinator was amazing with fantastic attention to detail, our day went so smoothly with Amy and Viki as our wedding day managers, all of our guest raved about all three courses.
The grounds were absolutely stunning for our photos along with there five star accommodation,

Well done white hart team for making our day so special , we can’t wait to celebrate our anniversary with you!
⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
V365,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"Our wedding was brought together with the expertise of Abbi, Laura & the whole white Hart team. The day ran so smoothly and everything was on point like clockwork! They helped answering any questions we had and went the extra mile when needed. If we could we would get married here all over again-fab venue and value for money!"
V365,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"The Barn at the White Hart is amazing, a beautiful setting and welcoming environment. The process was easy and they were patient with me and my many questions. The meetings were eye opening for details we had never even thought about, but so worth it!

The wedding itself was more than we could have ever dreamed of, everything ran so smoothly! This meant that we could enjoy ourselves and not worry about anything, the team had everything we needed and were so accommodating.

Everyone commented on how much they enjoyed themselves and all were amazed by the food, it was as good as it always is.

We cannot thank everyone at the White Hart enough!"
V365,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"There wasn't a moment during our planning with the White Hart, or the day itself where we didn't feel cared for. Originally, we chose to view it as thank to its website we knew it welcomed LGBT couples. From our first meeting. we were made welcome and everything was done to make sure neither one of us were sacrificing just because there were two brides!
The barn was perfect and the suggested DJ is phenomenal and great at reading a room. Even though it rained, there was no impact on the day. The staff were flexible, attentive and (most importantly as two ex-service workers!) everyone seemed to really like being there. We had complex dietary requirements with some guests and these were addressed brilliantly, with these guests getting personalised menus. There were also perfect vegetarian and vegan options. The guests in question went out of their way to thank us for their lovely menu, and none of them were treated any differently.

The biggest thank you to Laura and Abby for planning and managing the day. You were fantastic. An extra shout out to Josephine, who was a delight the whole time we were there and was the friendliest face as I walked over to meet the registrars."
V365,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"Lovely place, just perfect with lovely Barn an pub on the side, accommodation on site was just superb. Laura and Abi made all planing so easy and helped us to have perfect day"
V365,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"I could not recommend the White Hart more as a venue.
Laura and her team were professional and attentive throughout the entire wedding planning process, and will be as involved as you want or need them to be. Nothing is too much trouble for them.

The venue itself is beautiful, in a peaceful country setting, we loved it from our first visit. The mezzanine floor was something I'd never seen before at a venue, and I really felt it added something different and alternative to the venue, plus meant that if the weather took a turn for the worse, (which we were lucky to avoid on our day!) you or your guests won't get wet moving from ceremony to reception!

The bridal preparation suite is also beautiful and spacious enough for all you need in the morning, plus a view out over the front of the Inn where you can see your guests arriving!

Our guests have all commented on how lovely the venue is, as well as the gorgeous accommodation and amazing food. We are looking forward to returning for dinner or even to stay in one of the beautiful rooms.

We highly recommend the White Hart, the service is second to none, and the Wedding package prices are really competitive, we didn't have a huge budget but still managed to afford all we needed and wanted."
V366,The Lawn,"We had a really beautiful wedding day at The Lawn. The experienced team were very helpful with the planning and professional throughout, taking any potential stress out of the day so that we could relax and fully enjoy our special day. Everything went as planned, including the weather allowing us to get married outside in the very pretty gazebo (there was a great back-up plan in case of rain so we didn't have to worry!). Our 60 day guests enjoyed a three course meal which was of great quality; we had many compliments about the food and service, including the evening buffet for 110 guests. The Lawn is a fantastic setting for a wedding, coupled with great service, that we would thoroughly recommend."
V366,The Lawn,"I cannot express the gratitude I have for The Lawn. We had our day on the 25th May 2024 and from start to finish the staff were amazing.

The food was stunning! The venue itself is absolutely breathtaking. Thank you so much for making our day what it was… perfect. I could not recommend this venue enough."
V366,The Lawn,"Where to start? From beginning to end, The Lawn were the perfect venue choice! Not just because of the stunning house and gardens, but because David and the team made every step as stress-free and enjoyable as possible (even with all the questions we kept pinging them). We knew before we visited that The Lawn was the venue for us, to the point we booked then and there! We had absolutely no worries leading up to the day about how things were going to run and throughout the day there was always someone on hand (and with a smile). Honestly, words cannot express how wonderful our day was - utterly perfect! Thank you for everything!"
V366,The Lawn,"We were married in September 2023 and had our reception at the lawn. As it was an African-British wedding, we had many requests which the team at the Lawn really helped with. As we had exclusive use, the bridal party could get dressed at the Lawn before heading to Church and the parking was great for our guests travelling from long distances. Guests loved the horses and grounds. They particularly commented on being well catered for. It was a perfect day!"
V366,The Lawn,"The team at The Lawn helped us to host the perfect wedding. The amount of effort, thought and care that went into supporting us and everything we needed to make the day a success is amazing, this is possibly the first family event we’ve hosted where we have not felt the need to stress over a severe anaphylactic reaction.

From the minute we met we both felt at ease and confident our day would run smoothly, no question or request was too large.
They went above and beyond for us and it was truly appreciated, everyone has commented on the beauty of the venue as well as how smoothly and effortless the day ran.

We would honestly recommend the lawn for anyone looking for a venue to host a celebration - the venue is beautiful and the staff are absolutely amazing."
V366,The Lawn,The best day ever!!! Couldn’t of been any better thank you so much!! All the staff were fab and so so helpful nothing was ever to much hassle. Felt like one big family will be forever grateful!! Love chelsea and sam xx
V366,The Lawn,"Where do I start, we cannot thank you enough for hosting our wedding on Saturday. Your staff were fantastic and the whole day could not have gone any better.
I always knew I wanted to get married at the lawn as my own parents married here 24 years ago, I was 12 years old. 4 years later Matt and I got together and finally after 20 years we had our own special day at the lawn.

Everything from the planning beforehand, adapting the menus so everyone could eat the same including anyone with dietary requirements to how everything kept to schedule.
I was an emotional wreck most of the morning getting ready but you made sure I did not have to worry about anything downstairs and when I finally got to see everything I was blown away.

A special thank you to David, Michael and Lizzie. You are brilliant at what you do.

The caterers and waiting staff were amazing. The food came out all at the same time, was hot and extremely tasty. The staff serving were so kind and accommodating.

This day was long overdue but we were lucky our children got to share it with us like I got to with my parents and you all made it the best day which we will never ever forget. My parents said the high standards you set on Saturday was exactly the same when they got married and it really is the best place to get married so anyone looking for a place to have their wedding and reception book in quick you will not be disappointed.

Thank you again
Jade and Matthew.
Finally Mr & Mrs Judge xxx"
V366,The Lawn,"Wow! What can we say? A perfect day was had at the Lawn, with superb organisation, friendly staff and a beutiful building!"
V366,The Lawn,"We would just like to say a massive thank you for making our twilight
wedding such a magical experience for both of us.

From your patience in answering all our questions leading up to the day to
your almost fanatical weather watching all afternoon (who knew there were so
many apps?! ) and then your ability to switch everything to outside at the
eleventh hour to ensure we could have the service in your beautiful gazebo
just made the perfect start to an amazing evening and the start of our
married life.

Thank you again so much and we send our warmest wishes to you all"
V366,The Lawn,"The whole team did everything to make our day so special. Unfortunately the English weather didn't play ball with us, but it didn't affect the day at all. Everyone was so helpful and the day ran so smoothly. We just wish we could do it all again! Would recommend as a wedding venue!"
V367,Gosfield Hall,"I never imagined my wedding would be somewhere as stunning as Gosfield hall but from the minute we saw this venue we knew it was the one for us and didn't bother viewing anymore venues as we had already made our minds up about having our wedding here! We were absolutely blown away with the natural beauty of Gosfield hall and so booked two years in advance of our wedding day! The professionalism and advice we received from Linda was super helpful and informative on the run up to our wedding as there is soo much to think about! We loved that we could have our day and evening all in one place aswell as the option weather permitting to have our wedding ceremony outside. I'm pleased to say the weather was absolutely perfect on our wedding day and we got to have our fairytale wedding outside! The package we paid for was well worth the money! Our guests were absolutely spoilt on our day and have all said it was the best wedding they've ever been too! It was amazing to have our guests stay over aswell! Jocie our wedding planner was absolutely amazing! She was sooo friendly and super accommodating and went above and beyond on our day to make it absolutely perfect with no hiccups! She even helped dress me on the day as she knew how to do up a corset dress and my mother didn't have a clue lol she made all my wedding details and decorations come to life and done such a stunning job decorating our dream venue aswell as being super supportive towards me my family and guests! The honeymoon suite is the best we've ever seen and completely took ours and our guests breaths away! Mind blowing! The food,venue,grounds,accomodation and night before accomodation were absolutely stunning and we want to thank everyone at Gosfield hall for making our day soo incredible and special and a day we and our guests will never forget! We can't wait to return to Gosfield! Thank you everyone at Gosfield what an amazing place!"
V367,Gosfield Hall,"We had previously experienced Gosfield Hall as a guest before deciding on it for our anniversary.

Our day was beautiful and went according to plan. Our guests all had great feedback about the day.

The only thing we would have changed would have been more diverse menu for the main meals."
V367,Gosfield Hall,"Gosfield hall is a beautiful location for a wedding and their packages cover all the important stuff! We didn’t have to worry about caterers, wedding coordinator or a DJ - all included! Great service, lovely food and everyone really enjoyed the day! Our coordinator Jocie was fab on the day, getting everything organised and fetching anything we needed. Couldn’t have asked for better, she knew the time line and the day flowed really smoothly!"
V367,Gosfield Hall,"We got married at Gosfield Hall and everything about it was perfect from when we arrive to view it, booking, the communication and Faye Carter our wedding Coordinator! If you want the best wedding day with no hassle, Gosfield is your place!!"
V367,Gosfield Hall,"Myself and my Wife have just got married at Gosfield Hall,
Our expensive started when we viewed the venue and we first met Linda sales manager, she welcome us in & made us feel at home, we wasn’t sure how, but she made us feel calm like this was where we was meant to be.
Once we looked around at all the venue has to offer we had already made a decision as this is such a stunning location and instantly new this was what we wanted! It was just right for us.

We did not get made to feel pressured to make any decisions immediately however we did end up booking our big say within the next few days after our visit.

Our next contact was with Ellie our wedding planner, she was very helpful and nothing was ever to much, we enjoyed the food tasting at the venue and was very impressed with the experience, it was out of this world.
Ellie helped us through all of our problems and made sure all of our plans come to life.

Now on our big day, what can I say? The staff were amazing, Ellie couldn’t have done enough every time you wanted to ask a question she was next to us any time we needed something. She was there all the way through the day/ night & even the next morning, Ellie made our day Run seamlessly.
We’ve been to many weddings before but never have we had food as amazing as we did here.
Every guest was amazed at the food quality and commented on how delicious it was!
Just to sum up if you’re thinking about booking your wedding at Gosfield Hall don’t question it just book it. You will be amazed."
V367,Gosfield Hall,"The venue is stunning and was the perfect setting for our winter wedding (so much natural light even in January). Jocie Golbourn was our assigned wedding planning specialist and she is so kind, sweet, patient and professional. All our guests loved the venue but many actually commented on how flawless and seamless the day was organised and rooms decorated and prepared from each section of the wedding and we only have Jocie and venue staff to thank for their meticulous planning and preparations. The food and drinks were delicious. Couldn’t recommend this venue enough- we actually booked the venue on a whim and were SO happy when we visited for an open day. There’s no false advertisements- it’s stunning."
V367,Gosfield Hall,"Everything, from start to finish, was exactly what we wanted and more. The preparation was helped by our wonderful personal manager, Tara, and accommodated each and every one of our requests and needs. The venue is gorgeous, food delicious, and atmosphere felt special. Our friends and family all told us that this was such a spectacular wedding for them that it was the best they've ever been to. We felt completely taken care of, kept us calm and happy throughout the day, and kept all of our suppliers in place and to standard. It felt glamourous and unique. We wish we could relive the day over and over. It really was our dream wedding."
V367,Gosfield Hall,"We got married in Gosfield Hall in May and had the most amazing wedding day that any couple could ask for. The whole experience from the arrival the night before to leaving the day after was seamlessly managed by the team at the venue.
The house and the grounds looked absolutely stunning and Ellie and the team did a brilliant job at keeping the day running smoothly without making anyone feel rushed. Everyone there was immensely friendly and helpful and we really felt that everyone who worked there was invested in making our day feel special.
We fell in love with the venue when we booked it but the whole experience exceeded out expectations so much that we wish we could do it all again!"
V367,Gosfield Hall,"I wanted to take a moment to commend and state our appreciation for Jocie. She truly was phenomenal, approachable and no task was too big.
We had 5 months to plan our wedding and we loved every moment. With us both working in the service industry it was great to have someone who was so switched on and would be an asset to have on any team."
V367,Gosfield Hall,"Having just got married at Gosfield Hall I can honestly say it was the most beautiful venue and the most perfect day. The staff were so attentive and professional. The food was outstanding and the drinks and cocktails were fabulous. They couldn’t do enough to make sure our day was everything we’d dreamt of. I have to say a special thanks to Ellie - one of the wedding coordinators on site - she went above and beyond to help us plan our day and was there from the very moment I woke up delivering fresh pastries for breakfast to the moment she made me a cup of tea to go to bed with. I can’t thank you enough Ellie, you are an absolute credit to Gosfield Hall."

V369,Leez Priory,"I never in my life thought I would get married in a place like Leez priory! The whole experience from start to finish was just fantastic. The price breakdown was manageable and there was no pressure to take any upgrades offered. The things we got in our package were phenomenal and having a wedding planner was tremendous - our lady (Leanne) was an absolute god send!
They catered to all our needs and we were made to feel so comfortable and nothing was a problem! I’d highly suggest going to an event there before hand, just to get a feel of what it’s like full of people and enjoy their delicious food. We actually enjoyed their entertainer ( singer) so much we hired him for our wedding ☺️
Lee priory is just so beautiful. I can’t speak highly enough x"
V369,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory on the 7th of September 2024. Considering how long they have been a wedding venue, they were pretty flexible with some of the ideas we had for the venue styling that turned out amazingly!

The staff really made the day something special and couldn't have done enough for us. Special mention must be made for Leanne, our wedding planner, who was amazing!

Highly recommend the venue and the incredible team that helped to make our day so special!"
V369,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in October 2024. This venue is stunning both inside and out with immaculately kept grounds and interior. The hospitality in the lead up to and on the day of the wedding was fantastic. The food was also brilliant. Another great perk of this venue is the amount of on site accommodation.

A couple of drawbacks / experiences during our wedding. There are only a few toilets in the main building which kept blocking and overflowing throughout the evening which led to us taking some guests to the dressing room or honeymoon cottage to use the facilities. You are also restricted by the venue on any external food or drink suppliers and the venues optional extras for this are quite expensive for what they are.

That asaide, we had the best day and evening at Leez Priory and would certainly recommend it!"
V369,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in August 2024- great venue and experience from initial viewing to leaving the morning after the wedding. Leanne acted as our wedding planner and was friendly, professional and helpful throughout. We opted for the classic package and the food was amazing quality with everyone commenting how full they were!
The venue is beautiful with several options for ceremony both inside and out. Accommodation was great too. The whole day ran smoothly with perfect weather - we will have very happy memories of our day!"
V369,Leez Priory,"Perfect venue and very attentive staff, lovely food and great communication from start to finish"
V369,Leez Priory,"Stunning venue. Fantastic Team. Very accommodating toward our unique ""surprise"" strategy. Our guests were truly surprised. Thank you."
V369,Leez Priory,"Leez priory was the 1st and only venue we looked around when we started planning our wedding. From the moment we stepped on the premises, everything just looked so perfect and exactly what we wanted from a wedding venue. When we got assigned our wedding co-ordinator Rachel, she was just absolutely spot on with everything we asked for and nothing was too big an ask for her. She made sure the day ran as smoothly as possible and took care of any issue that arose without me knowing (which I am forever grateful for!!)
The rest of the staff were amazing and very helpful.

The venue itself is just absolutely stunning and we loved that it has the pub area as well as the dance floor so it catered to all of our guests.

All of the rooms were lovely and it was so nice being able to stay in the fisherman’s lodge onsite the night before the wedding.

We genuinely cannot recommend this venue enough and it was 100% worth the money! 10/10!"
V369,Leez Priory,"We got married on a Tuesday in October to maximise the value of what we could get for our money; and honestly, we got everything we wanted and more. Leanne, our Wedding Manager was perfect at bringing an attention to detail and seamless organisation to the big day, and in the lead up. There wasn't one moment of the day where we felt stressed, as Leanne had it covered. In one particular instance, our flowers for the bridal party's hair hadn't arrived. Within five minutes of telling Leanne that we needed this, the flowers were with our hair and make-up suppliers to add the finishing touches.

Leez Priory as a venue is the most stunning setting, and offers an incredible range of areas in which the ceremony and reception can take place. There is also the opportunity for the bridal party to make use of the Fisherman's Cottage the night before the wedding, and for people to stay in the on-site accommodation on the evening of the wedding, making it the perfect venue for people also travelling from further afield.

Leez Priory were very accommodating, welcoming and were happy to work with us to make our day as perfect as possible. The food was incredible, and a total hit with all of our guests, and so many people have commented on how incredible the day was as a whole. You wouldn't be disappointed to choose Leez Priory."
V369,Leez Priory,They catered to our every need. To when we would ask for things they hadn’t been done before they still made sure it went smoothly. Leanne was amazing she made me feel so comfortable from the start. The whole day was stunning. Beautiful venue please go view it as you will not be disappointed
V369,Leez Priory,We got married on the 26 May 2024. This venue was absolutely brilliant! They catered for every need and made sure there was no stress on the day. Leanne was kind and level headed throughout and was always one step ahead! Do not hesitate to book- do it now!
V370,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"Best day of our lives!

The Roslin wedding experience was absolutely flawless from the first meeting we had to the day after our most special wedding day!

Amy and Evan were so supportive and understanding throughout the whole planning experience. They both made us feel so special.

Stefan was exceptional on our wedding day, keeping the day running smoothly and meaning that we could both enjoy the day ourselves without having to worry.

We have had so many people say it was the best wedding they have ever been to. The food was just perfect.

Garry, the DJ was a really nice guy and the dance floor was full all night. Thank you so much Garry!

The bridal suite is absolutely perfect. So many beautiful little touches. The stay was wonderful for all of our guests and the breakfast was outstanding. Even the ladies on the checkout desk made us feel special.

Thank you so much to everyone at the Roslin for making our wedding day so perfect and run so smoothly!

Lots of love,
Mr & Mrs Pope x"
V370,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"Thank you so much for all you have done to make our wedding so perfect.
From the very beginning the team have been communicative and friendly. Very quick replies to emails and quick to answer questions with helpful advice and tips.
On the day the team ensured that everything ran as smoothly as possible. The food was incredible and we have received many compliments regarding the catering team.
The team were both professional and friendly and nothing was too much trouble.
Our stay overnight was in a gorgeous room with a beautiful view.
Breakfast in the morning was delicious.
Thank you again."
V370,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"Well, Amy and the team - what can we say?? Our day was absolute perfection. Here are some things we would like to comment on to demonstrate just how amazing the day was:
Ceremony - complete attention to detail - we were not going to have a signing table as we had legally married the day before - Amy was honest and said the room would look bare and she was absolutely right - so glad we decided to listen to Amy's advice. The room was decorated stunningly - there was such attention to detail - extras of our flowers were placed tastefully in vases around the room, there were lanterns and candles that we had not asked for but made the room look more finished. There were extra centre pieces we had provided - these were placed in different areas to compliment the theme.
Bridal party arrival - upon arrival there was a complimentary bottle of prosecco for the party in the bridal suite. The suite was beautiful and our bouquets were laid out so nicely for us. We asked for some more champagne flutes and straight away, within 2 mins there were some at our door.
En route to the ceremony I was worried about the song and when everyone had to walk in - why I was worried I do not know as Amy had listened to it numerous times and knew exactly when to send everyone in. Amy and Evan even sorted out my dress so it looked beautiful walking down the aisle.
Throughout the ceremony the team had tidied the bridal suite room and put chocolates and petals on the bed. When I went to show my husband the suite, I had warned him that it had been a bit of a mess - but no - Amy and the team had ensured it looked almost as if noone had been there!
Drinks reception - we went for photos on the beach and whilst this was happening there was canapes and prosecco - at previous weddings people had commented that they (as bride and groom) had not had the opportunity to try their canapes as they had been doing photos - but the team had thought of this and Tate brought us out our own little plate with 2 of each canapes each.
The change over was swift and the room looked fabulous for dinner thanks for Evan and her guidance - Amy had suggested having a smaller number of tables and more people on each otherwise the tables would look bare - again absolutely the right decision. We had some elderly guests and while the change over was happening they were given chairs to sit on which was no drama whatsoever for the staff.
The meal - everyone raved about the food - it was sublime - presented so tastefully and portions were generous. It was a really lovely touch that Tate went around and asked every single table, not just the top table, how their food was. This was great as I have never seen this at a wedding before.
Again, turnaround for the evening was flawless and the ballroom looked beautiful.
Other things that made our day extra special - everyone who was part of the wedding party received room upgrades free of charge which really made everyone feel special; we didnt have time to try our cake, but the team had realised this would be the case and on arrival to the bridal suite after the evening there was two slices of cake presented beautifully with some of the left over flowers, as well as our gifts and cards and the left over drinks from dinner service. Nothing went to waste as the bottles of wine that were not used at dinner were left on the bar for guests to enjoy in the evening too.
We cannot fault the service or staff at the Roslin at all.
A few special mentions -
Nicky behind the bar - you are a wonderful woman and made sure nothing was too much - you made drinks with love and were a real hit with the guests, everyone said how wonderful you were. Thank you for being great.
Tate - wow - you were so calm and collected - if we wanted 5 mins to ourselves that was not an issue - nothing was too much to ask. You ensured the day ran smoothly (we were always on time throughout the day) and you ensured that everyone was well looked after. Thank you - you are fantastic at your job.
Evan - You ensured the turn around of the room was done quickly but with class and flawlessly finished. Thank you.
Amy - what can we say - your team are an absolute credit to you, and it is because of you that we had a wedding that was more than we ever could have dreamed of. Your operations runs like a well-oiled machine but at the same time ensures the authenticity and personalism of every single wedding, to ensure it retains it individuality. Some weddings have felt like 'conveyer belts' but every single person spoke so highly of you, the team and the venue. Thank you endlessly for your love and dedication to what you do. It is very evident.
One small thing - oh... who are we kidding! The day was the most perfect experience. We will treasure The Roslin and our treatment as bride and groom forever. You are wonderful people, great value for money as a venue and you will always hold a special place in our heart. Thank you. Mr and Mrs Lee"
V370,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"Where to begin…. If anyone is thinking of having a wedding here, DO IT! The most stress free and lovable venue we could have asked for, Special thanks to Evan and Amy were incredible leading up to and on the day! The venue is stunning, the food was sooo goood, and the staff were fantastic!
Magical!!
Many Thanks, Nathan!"
V370,The Roslin Beach Hotel,Brilliantly done. Being so busy I wanted a venue that would just get it done. They did that and did it perfectly!!! Everyone commented on the brilliance of the Roslin!
V370,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"Thank you for all your hard work to make our day extra special and run so smoothly. We were both so relaxed the whole day, enjoying every moment. Amy is truly amazing at her job and just get 'it', she saw our vision and made it come to life. People complimented on the day and the Roslin team are at the top of their game."
V370,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"A very big heartfelt thank you for all your help and guidance, assistance and planning on our wedding day along with the lead up to it.

A special mention goes to our events manager Amy, you were a godsend from start to finish, thank you so much for your perfect organisation skills and helping run the wedding morning so calmly. Zed & Tate - thank you for all of your help and co-ordination during our wedding, evening and Sunday celebrations.

You all made our day perfect and complete, we could not have imagined holding our special day anywhere else."
V370,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"We can’t thank Roslin Beach Hotel enough for all of their help, everything went so smoothly and Amy helped us all to stay so calm!! We had such an amazing day and all of the members of staff could not do enough for all of us , the service was impeccable!! Couldn’t have asked for a better venue , the food was amazing and We were treated so well. Thanks again for all of your kindness , Amy and her team really made our day PERFECT !!"
V370,The Roslin Beach Hotel,Thank you so much to all management and staff for making my daughter and son-in-law's wedding day so special on 1st June. All your hard work and dedication showed through on the day. Thank you once again!
V370,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"We would like to say a big thank you to you and all the Roslin staff for making Ruth & Kelly's Wedding such a wonderful memorable day. Attention to detail was first class. DJ, flowers, the food, the waiting staff, in fact, the whole package couldn't have been better. Our guests were full of praise for this exceptional venue."
V371,Wivenhoe House,"we had a summer wedding July 2022. we had a garden ceremony.

from the day of enquiry to the day of the wedding, the team were fantastic, nothing was a problem, they were so willing to arrange, or sort out everytging.
We originally booked during covid but dates were moved due to health reasons, the team were more than happy to assist
they are great for advice and guidance for recommendations of suppliers that are loyal to them and reasonably priced also.

they were especially kind to my father who is in a wheelchair paralysed, Lionel one of the management team made sure a member of staff was always on hand helping him, to make the day as stress free for both of my parents, from the day before when they arrived to the moment they left with their luggage.
Lionel also organised the party of 20+ guests (including children) staying the night before the wedding the marquee for us all to have our evening meal together next to the restaurant, which was so kind.

the groom and i got ready separately in different areas of the hotel. i had a bridal team of 10 as did he, the wivenhoe team, were there continuously helping assisting and asking if we needed anything,

i had a particular set up of my décor for my tables, sweet cart etc, and lisa the events manager knew exactly my style and had it done perfectly. she was there early before she was expected helping and organising going above and beyond what she was needed to do, to make our day perfect.

the food was amazing, we had cocktails, canapes, wedding breakfast and the evening buffet, everyone was impressed with the high standard of food and service. (especially the guests who had special dietary requirements, who were very well looked after and felt like VIP’s)

lisa was a rock to us she was always there wherever i needed her, and she made our day flawless and perfect!

the reception team, were a great help, we had 20 rooms booked in the end, and i was constantly emailing for adding more and having a spreadsheet of who has booked etc.

the management team and the staff are wonderful
if we could afford it we would do it all over again a heartbeat! Was the happiest day of our lives, never stopped smiling or laughing x"
V371,Wivenhoe House,"From the initial meeting through to the day of our wedding Louise and Phoebe were excellent.
Nothing was too much trouble.
In the day of the wedding they dressed the venue to the highest standard and were so attentive, even helping my daughter when her speech became so emotional.
I cannot rate them high enough.
Stunning venue with the highest level of service.
Price was reasonable with so many extras included saving the stress of sorting discos and catering.
1000% the best choice we made.
Thank you Wivenhoe house for making our dream wedding come true."
V371,Wivenhoe House,"The Wivenhoe House Hotel, Colchester.
The whole experience from beginning to end was faultless.
Perfect day."
V371,Wivenhoe House,"Our wedding at wivenhoe house was everything we dreamed of!. The setting is beautiful and our wedding coordinator lisa, was just perfect. Price was very reasonable too! Amazing food and service :)"
V371,Wivenhoe House,"The wedding couldn’t have gone anymore amazing thanks to the team at Wivenhoe house. We was meant to get married in 2020, then 2021 and finally managed 2022. This was with massive support from the team also. The day went so amazing as they all went above and beyond for us."
V371,Wivenhoe House,"We got married nearly a year ago now 1/11/2019.
Wivenhoe house is truest beautiful and it I feel should be higher on people’s list for a wedding venue. The house is beautiful and I loved my wedding day. Katie was perfect as a planner and listened to us completely even my husbands idea of llamas!! Which we didn’t follow through with. The price was amazing for what we got included!!
The food was so great!! Especially the pudding and the evening buffet was the best I’d seen for the amount and selection. Would highly recommend the sliders. Overall I would give 10/10."
V371,Wivenhoe House,"I enjoyed most of it my wedding coordinator done well as well with all staff, room are clean decoration was lovely ,stunning areas ,food for my wedding breakfast is delicious all our guest ? love it ,we look after properly I highly recommend Wivenhoe house for wedding ."
V371,Wivenhoe House,Thank you so much for all your help in arranging our beautiful wedding reception. Everybody loved the day and we’re very impressed with your staff. They were attentive and approachable. We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Wivenhoe House to friends and family. We couldn’t be happier. The food was beautiful. We wish you all the best and thank you for all your patience. Hope to see you all again in the future.
V371,Wivenhoe House,"My husband and I got married here on the 30th June. We honestly couldn't have picked a better venue. We first visited this venue on a wedding open evening that they had, and it was incredibly busy. Yet, there was a member of staff on hand that could help and attend any questions/queries that we had. I'd spent a year planning our wedding, mainly with Katie Ballard. Her help and knowledge of wedding planning really was second to none. I'd never planned a wedding before so all of her help and guidance was very much appreciated. I had many visits to WHH throughout the year and each member of staff honestly couldn't do more for you. We did a menu tasting for our wedding day and was assisted by Ellie in the Brasserie. Her knowledge on all of the food options available was very impressive. The food was outstanding, we had 3 courses and 4 different dishes and each one was cooked and served to perfection. It's safe to say that Our wedding day was more than I could ever had imagined. It truly was perfect in every way and ran incredibly smoothly. Our guests also found the staff to be incredibly helpful and attentive, as they were helped with luggage, and allowing a few guests into their rooms a little earlier. I honestly couldn't recommend this venue enough. The house and grounds are breathtaking. And the staff are truly what make it the most wonderful, memorable experience."
V371,Wivenhoe House,"We booked Wivenhoe house bout a year before the wedding, we had amazing service from start to finish! Louise was responsive to all emails and incredibly helpful in sorting out all of the final details.

The day ran incredibly smoothly, all of the staff were fantastic."
V372,Stock Brook Country Club,We fell in love when we saw the venue for the very first time. It's beautiful and you can really go to town with decorations or keep it as simple as you like. The venue looked even better than I had pictured on my wedding day. We got so many compliments about the canapés and food at the wedding day as well. The only disappointing thing I found was that we couldn't access the bridal suite to get ready until 11am which is in the courtyard and where you can get amazing pictures. We had to start getting ready in a hotel nearby and then move there which was extremely stressful I begged Stock Brook to provide us with another room or access from 10 as that would've worked for us but they wasn't helpful at all if I'm honest. It's something I never really thought of until you are arranging timings for hair and make up etc and most people can access their prep room a lot earlier but the rest of the day made up for this and I really did have the best day.
V372,Stock Brook Country Club,"This venue was everything we had ever dreamed of and more. The venue is stunning and the space perfect. We got married in the rosewood suite which is a lovely long aisle to walk down, had the reception drinks in the gardens which was stunning and perfect for a hot sunny day. Our evening was upstairs in the ballroom and this was the whole reason we chose this venue. The space is perfect and the dance floor and glitter ball is so pretty. With the help of our venue decorator this room was breathtaking.

From start to finish our wedding co ordinator was on hand to answer any questions we had and helped us to ensure our day was perfect."
V372,Stock Brook Country Club,My husband and I booked our wedding with Stock Brook Manor in early 2019. I want to mention Joe who was our planner and contact at Stock Brook. He helped us plan a big wedding and then COVID happened. Joe helped us plan a smaller wedding and genuinely his help was invaluable. We are so thankful to Joe for working with us to make our day perfect. I would recommend Stock Brook Manor. Beautiful venue and amazing service from Joe and the other staff who work hard and are so friendly.
V372,Stock Brook Country Club,"We had the most fabulous day, Stock Brook is the best and most perfect wedding venue in the area. The venue speaks for itself and the food, service and wedding planning support are as brilliant. As a PA who is usually the bossy organiser, it was apparent from the outset that the team there have everything running perfectly so I felt more than happy taking a step back and concentrate on other areas of the wedding. I cannot thank the team including firstly Joe and then in the main Eleanor for everything they did. I couldn’t have dreamed of a better day."
V372,Stock Brook Country Club,"My husband and I got married at Stockbrook at the weekend, and had an absolutely fantastic day. All the staff from the cleaners to the waiting and bar staff were fantastic and work so hard to make it a perfect day. A particular mention to Joe Howgate who ensured everything on the day was perfect (which is no easy task with me being such a perfectionist). The food was amazing, and we had several comments that it was the best food people had tasted at a wedding. Overall, it was a fantastic day, thank you to all the staff, you’re AMAZING!! We will never forget our wonderful day!"
V372,Stock Brook Country Club,"From start to finish, everyone was great. Eleanor Pitts was our event planner, she went above and beyond at every opportunity. She helped us with the finer details that I wouldn't have even thought of. Venue was stunning, I wasn't aware of any faults, if there was any, we didn't have a clue. Eleanor helped make the day perfect, thank you sooo much."
V372,Stock Brook Country Club,"On our initial visit to Stockbrook Manor we instantly fell I love with the venue.
Joe, our coordinator was amazing throughout from when we had our initial planning meeting all the way to our final meeting. He was extremely thorough, patient & organised which really put our minds at ease.
Brides please bear with Joe as there were some periods of radio silence towards the wedding but this was due to the fact that Joe had a large number of weddings to coordinate. On our wedding day Joe was amazing, he knew our day like the back of his hand which really made the day perfect.
All our guests haven't stopped commenting on our wedding day, from the canapes to drinks, to the food and evening food! Guests who stayed at great blunts and the stables loved the accommodation. Thanks to all the staff at Stockbrook and especially Joe who we feel blessed to have as our coordinator.

From

The Frasers"
V372,Stock Brook Country Club,"It's versatility, the size, the use of both outdoor and indoor space and the decor (of both the venue plus the stunning Great Blunts House accommodation). We were also really impressed with the added extras that were included in the wedding package. We also really appreciated how flexible and open minded you were with our ideas with regards to themes and how we wanted the set up. The operation of the day couldn't have gone any better. You delivered everything we had planned and you didn't let me down in any aspect. One of my aunties was so happy with the quality of the food she wanted to thank the chef in person. Best wishes to you and all the fantastic team at Stock Brook."
V372,Stock Brook Country Club,"A massive thank you to all staff at Stock Brook Country Club for helping us bring our magical wedding day together! In particular Eleanor who has helped guide and accomodate us with all our planning and making our journey a smooth one! The venue itself is beautiful and spacious and looked elegant on the day thanks to Sophie, and her beautiful decorations. The guests enjoyed the food, drink and in particular spoke very highly of the stables accommodation we stayed at. We could not have asked for more and very pleased x"
V372,Stock Brook Country Club,"We would just like to say a massive thank you. From the minute we met you, we knew you had got this! From the bottom of our hearts it was truly the best day of our lives! All our guests haven't stopped commenting on our wedding day, from the canapes to drinks, to the food and evening food! Our guests said it's the best wedding food they have ever had. You made sure everthing was perfect for us. We can't thank you enough."
V373,Vaulty Manor,"Beautiful venue, lovely staff! Thank you for a wonderful day.
5 * service!"
V373,Vaulty Manor,"Beautiful day, thank you to the whole team for everything. Stunning venue and the staff were amazing. Everything ran smoothly and the whole wedding was better than we could have ever dreamt of. Thanks a million, it was a great day that we will remember for the rest of our lives."
V373,Vaulty Manor,"Very good day overall, everything went according to plan, food was lovely and staff friendly too."
V373,Vaulty Manor,"Wonderful wedding, thank you so much. The food was amazing and all help with the planning was great."
V373,Vaulty Manor,"Wonderful wedding, thank you so much. The food was amazing and all help with the planning was great."
V373,Vaulty Manor,Great professional and lovely staff. Food was delicious. Would highly recommend Vaulty Manor to anyone looking for a venue.
V373,Vaulty Manor,"Beautiful ceremony, gorgeous grounds and buildings. Staff worked extremely hard which helped make the day so wonderful."
V373,Vaulty Manor,"Staff were attentive and polite, rooms were very nice and breakfast the morning after was just right. Lovely venue."
V373,Vaulty Manor,"Very well hosted by the staff, would highly recommend this fantastic venue."
V373,Vaulty Manor,"Great food and staff, the venue is lovely and the bright sunshine made it even more special"
V374,Hutton Hall,"I just wanted to express my deepest gratitude to you both, and your amazing team of staff. From the day we booked, to enjoying breakfast the morning after the wedding, you have spoiled us with such a personal level of service. I honestly felt as if our wedding day was a luxury house party. It felt so intimate from start to finish. I've often said that, you wouldn't be greeted with the same level of personable service at a large cooperate venue. This is what made our wedding day so very special.
A special mention to the incredible Ray, who ensured our wedding day went smoothly, as well as keeping on top of the beautiful roaring fires! Also, a special mention to Marion, who ended up driving me and my Mum to the church when the rain scuppered my country walk plans. All our very dear friends and family, have complimented us on such a beautiful venue choice, and how it is possibly the best wedding they've ever been to.
So, thank you once again for all you did. May we wander the country lane for weekends to come, dreaming of our very special wedding day at Hutton Hall."
V374,Hutton Hall,"From the moment we first stepped foot into Hutton Hall we knew it was our dream venue! We truly had the wedding of our dreams.
From staying the night before, to getting ready in the morning, to dancing the wedding night away, every part of the day was perfect. We could not have wished for anything more!"
V374,Hutton Hall,"My husband and I had the most perfect wedding day at Hutton Hall. The owner, Paola, offers brilliant wedding packages and the catering outsourced to Limeberry, was outstanding. The bridal suite and guest bedrooms are luxurious and comfortable. The grounds are outstanding and brilliant for photographs. I couldn't recommend this venue more!"
V374,Hutton Hall,"Words cannot describe how beautiful Hutton Hall is.

As soon as we pulled through the gates we knew this venue was for us. We had already seen a few venues and this on made us go WOW!

Every single room in Hutton Hall was stunning!

Paola and Francesca were so lovely and we were so grateful to get to know them and their family.

We felt so at ease at the venue and had the most lovely overnight stay and breakfast as well.

I am hoping I can stay again in the future to remember the great memories of our wedding.

A magnificent venue, would highly recommend.

Mr and Mrs Hernaman xx"
V374,Hutton Hall,"Hutton Hall had everything we were looking for from a venue its stunning and has the wow factor plus for me with the beautiful village church based just at the back of the grounds, over the little wooden bridge it couldn't have been more perfect for a church wedding and then reception location!
We hired the bridal suite and bedrooms the night before the wedding so we had access to the light, bright and lovely preparation room for myself, mum and bridesmaids to get ready with an early start on the day.

The marquee set up for the wedding breakfast was beautiful overlooking the grounds and the fountains and with the sides up as it was a nice day was just perfect.

I was initially a little worried about the space as we had 100 guests in the day time, and 30+ in the evening, but I shouldn't have been concerned as it worked brilliantly and never felt overcrowded. The dancefloor even though it's a separate room was constantly busy all night and the courtyard and main hall and bars were perfect for people to mingle!

We had so many compliments from friends and family about what a great venue and day it was and we were honestly thrilled.

The Georgian Manor house with its high ceilings and beautiful features was ideal as we wanted light and airy, with a feeling of glamour / grandeur. I have to say it had all this, while also feeling intimate.
We fell in love with Hutton Hall straight away, and booked very quickly after our first viewing. Francesca and Paula are brilliant and answered all my many questions and worked with us to coordinate the day. They also work with a great selection of their tried and tested suppliers who are not only nice people but deliver a top class service.

I cannot recommend Hutton Hall enough, and if you have any doubts over the suppliers included in the packages, we can confirm Limeberry catering provided a slick service the food was delicious, hot and well presented with a lovely team of waiting staff and DJ AJ (Paul G) was fantastic keeping the dancefloor busy all night too. They have such a great team on board here, which makes life so much easier as a bride, if I'd have known how great it was going to be, i wouldn't have wasted less time worrying about the little things!

Thank you so much for the best day of our lives.

V374,Hutton Hall,We had the best day at Hutton Hall. The building and grounds are beautiful and all of the staff are lovely! Paola helped us organise everything and answered all of our questions promptly. She supported us throughout the delays due to covid and was very understanding. We had the most magical day and Hutton Hall made it run smoothly and stress free! Definitely recommend.
V374,Hutton Hall,"Seamless day in the most beautiful venue. From the moment I viewed Hutton Halls website i knew it would be our venue. The whole building is stunning - from the blue room to the bridal prep room to the grounds.

It is run by the two loveliest ladies - Paola and Francesca who are always on hand to answer (my many!) questions.

The evening before myself and my bridesmaids stayed at the venue which I recommend doing as it made the build up so special. Paola bought us a nice cold bottle of Prosecco up and a lovely cup of tea for me (my favourite!). We ordered in food and had a really relaxed luxurious night in their beautiful bedrooms - the huge bridal suite bath is a must!

The day of the wedding was seamless. Everyone who came said it was the most beautiful venue they’d been to. The entrance hall when you walk in is breathtaking and there are many silk flower arrangements around helping the decor of the day look extra stunning.

The food on the day was spectacular. We used Limeberry who are a preferred supplier of the venue and I’m extremely fussy on food but wow - they really blew us away! The food was plentiful (nothing worse than being hungry at a wedding but no chance here!) and Angie who ran the catering side was super helpful and made sure we had everything we needed. The dishes were made gluten free with no issue and were delicious.

Our day was just everything we had dreamed of and more - the photos are breathtaking. I can’t thank Paola enough for pulling together the day of my dreams and being so friendly and helpful along the way.

If you’re thinking of holding your wedding here it’ll be the best choice you’ve made. It was a fairytale day"
V374,Hutton Hall,Paola was a great host when showing me and my fiance around the venue. I can't wait to visit here again and get married here next year! Thanks
V374,Hutton Hall,"Hutton Hall was everything we were looking for in our venue, and did not disappoint on the day. It was absolutely stunning, offering we wanted very conveniently located next to each other: huge and luxurious bridal suite and guest rooms, outside ceremony area, beautiful gardens for champagne reception and garden games, stunning marquee for the dinner, spacious areas inside for dancing, seating areas and two bars, and beautiful fairy light courtyard for our evening pizza. The team behind Hutton Hall are what make this venue truly ideal though. We felt supported and in very safe hands throughout the planning process and on the day, and truly felt like the whole team genuinely wanted our day to run perfectly...and it really did! You won't be disappointed!"
V374,Hutton Hall,"The bridal party arrived just after 10 o’clock to be greeted with a lovely smile and hug from Paola. We were left to get on with our preparations. But someone was on hand to help if needed.
What a fantastic venue. Lovely people. Fabulous grounds. We didn’t want to leave. Thank You to everyone at Hutton Hall for a great day."
V375,Smeetham Hall Barn,"If you are looking for a romantic barn setting Smeetham hall barn is the one…we can not thank Sophie and the team at Smeetham hall for being nothing but incredible through the whole process of planning our wedding and to the most amazing day we could have ever wished for…what we would give to relive the day all over again

Thank you once again for being so amazing

Mr & Mrs Field (Lucy & Rob) 05.04.25 X"
V375,Smeetham Hall Barn,"We first found came across Smeetham Hall Barn 7 years ago. After looking at other venues we kept being drawn back here. The venue and grounds are absoutely stunning. Sophie has been amazing from the very beginning, nothing was too much trouble even arranging for my nan to come along in her wheelchair which meant so much to us. Our day could not have gone any smoother. Our wedding breakfast was fantastic, a lot of guests complimented the food and the service from Splinters Caterers. We could not have asked for a more perfect wedding day!"
V375,Smeetham Hall Barn,"We fell in love with Smeetham Hall Barn from the moment we pulled up in the car. The venue is absolutely beautiful. Sophie was fantastic, from the very first email to arrange a viewing, right up to the big day. She took the stress out of planning our wedding and allowed us to simply enjoy the process. Nothing was ever too much trouble, and emails were replied to within the day. Our wedding day was the best day, and this is thanks to
Sophie and the team at the beautiful Smeetham Hall Barn. The only downside was that the wedding flew by so quickly; we wish we could relive it all over again."
V375,Smeetham Hall Barn,"Smeetham Hall Barn was the perfect venue for us. It was the only venue we viewed and an easy decision - it had everything we were looking for. It certainly lived up to our hopes and dreams. The barn and setting are naturally beautiful, without requiring loads of additional decoration. Their twinkly fairy lights set the scene perfectly. Having so many scenic spots for a variety of photograph opportunities is ideal. Our experience from booking to our big day was seamless. We were always kept informed and knew we’d hear back quickly if we had any queries. Sophie helped so much behind the scenes to ensure everything went to plan, she consistently eased any neves and went above and beyond for us. Splinters the caterers who are included within our wedding package were brilliant. The wedding breakfast was delicious and all our guests were very complimentary. Thank you to all at Smeetham Hall Barn and Splinters for being part of our perfect day. We loved every second and will forever hold the fondest memories 🤍"
V375,Smeetham Hall Barn,"Sophie and Victoria were absolutely brilliant in the lead up to our wedding, they were always ready to answer my many many questions 😂 They were so organised and made the day run perfectly. Tom behind the bar was brilliant too.
We’ve had so many compliments on how beautiful the venue was and how amazing the day was. We are both so grateful to the whole team at Smeetham Hall for everything they did for our perfect day. Would highly recommend!!"
V375,Smeetham Hall Barn,"Smeetham is such a perfect place to get married. The team supported us every step of the way, even when we were asking so many questions, and they were always so happy to help. Everyone is so kind and they understood our vision for the day. Everything went so perfectly and I couldn’t have ask for a better day! Thank you so so much!"
V375,Smeetham Hall Barn,"They say it’s the people who make your wedding, and that couldn't be more true. We were not only surrounded by family and friends but also by a team who truly felt like part of our celebration. A huge thank you to the entire Smeetham Hall Barn team, but with a special mention to Bridget, who welcomed us so warmly on our first visit that Smeetham instantly felt like home, and left us with no question that this was the venue for us. And to Sophie, thank you for all of your support throughout our planning journey, for always being just an email away with answers to our questions, for welcoming us at open days, and for being such a friendly presence on both our setup and wedding day whilst making sure everything went smoothly - we couldn’t have asked for more.

Smeetham Hall Barn itself provided the perfect setting for our autumnal wedding. Having worked in events ourselves, we were eager to find a venue with authentic charm, not a corporate feel. After viewing several other ‘barns,’ we started to wonder if we’d have to compromise, but Smeetham exceeded our hopes - it was everything we’d been searching for and more. With its unique, rustic character and all the amenities needed for a perfect wedding day, Smeetham Hall Barn truly stands out, and we feel very lucky to have stumbled across such a beautiful venue, less than half an hour from home. We were given complete flexibility to customise the space to suit our theme and add personal touches, with helpful recommendations for suppliers along the way. Having a full day to set up allowed us to truly enjoy the experience, extending our celebrations and ensuring everything looked just as we’d envisioned, without the stress or time pressures - a rarity in the wedding industry.

Looking back, our only wish is that we could do it all over again - it was truly the perfect day. We couldn’t recommend Smeetham Hall Barn more highly to anyone searching for their wedding venue."
V375,Smeetham Hall Barn,"Picking a venue is just….woah. It’s a LOT. Except when it’s not, because you’re made to feel like centre stage from the outset. We’d viewed a few venues which were starting to blur into one and a feeling a bit overwhelmed with it all. So if it’s the people that make a wedding, you can definitely include the Smeetham Hall team with that.
From the open evening, to booking and run through to the event (and MANY emails in between) they were only too happy to help. And encourage some out of the box fun with it.
SO many positive vibes from our guests about the venue itself from the ceremony on the lawn, the outdoor drinks reception and the barn itself for the wedding breakfast. Each element creating it’s own little piece of the day.
Great vendor partners on hand too to make sorting details like the food, DJ, lighting etc a breeze.
Thank you Sophie and Victoria.
James and Laressa Human"
V375,Smeetham Hall Barn,"WOW…where do we start! Firstly, we planned our wedding from Australia and from our initial video call with Bridget we knew there was something very special about Smeetham Hall Barn and we were in safe hands. Sophie - you were amazing, quickly getting back to my questions over the year and ensuring everything ran smoothly on the day. Tom went above and beyond for the evening bar, honouring a special request we had for an evening drink - so incredible! The whole process was seamless and we couldn’t be anymore grateful to everyone at Smeetham Hall Barn for making ensuring we had the best day of our lives, which we truly did! Cannot recommend SHB enough - thank you everyone, we want to do it all over again ! ♥️"
V375,Smeetham Hall Barn,"Our wedding at Smeetham Hall Barn on 10th June 2024 was absolutely perfect! The venue’s elegant charm and stunning grounds provided a beautiful backdrop for our special day.

The staff were exceptional, handling every detail with professionalism and care, allowing us to truly enjoy our celebration.

Smeetham Hall Barn offered the perfect mix of beauty, excellent service, and a warm ambiance. We couldn’t have asked for a better place to celebrate our wedding and highly recommend it to any couple looking for an unforgettable venue."
V376,Hedsor House,"After getting engaged on July 1st, 2023, I used Hitched to find local wedding venues and discovered Hedsor. From the moment we found Hedsor, we knew no other venue could compare (even without visiting in person).

We arranged a virtual tour with Kate and instantly felt a connection. She was professional, knowledgeable, and friendly, making us feel confident that we were in very safe hands. Although we initially planned to marry in 2025 due to other commitments in 2024, we found a rare opportunity to get married at Hedsor on December 29th, 2023. What started as a hypothetical possibility quickly became reality after talking with Kate and Hedsor's preferred suppliers. We decided to take the plunge (yes, we are mad!).

Since Hedsor's packages were unavailable during the Christmas break, we opted to dry-hire the house and worked with a mix of preferred and self-sourced suppliers. Organising everything in just four months was crazy, but Kate was always there to support and guide us through the process. We truly could not have done it without her and the wider Hedsor team!

As for the wedding day itself—just WOW. It was perfect from start to finish, exceeding our very high expectations. The house was beautifully decorated for Christmas, adding an extra touch to this already stunning and special place. Trish and the team ran the day like a military operation, allowing my husband and me to fully relax and savour every moment.

Thank you to everyone at Hedsor for making our wedding day the best day of our lives. It turned out to be even more than our dream day!"
V376,Hedsor House,My dream wedding in our dream venue. From start to finish Hedsor house was everything I dreamt of and more. The staff were amazing and they made our day stress free!
V376,Hedsor House,"Hedsor House.... Why wouldn't you choose Hedsor!? From the get go Hedsor ticked all of our boxes for the show-stopper Wedding we imagined. The bonus is that you have exclusive use of the mansion & we opted to dry hire the day before our wedding and had a pre-wedding celebration with guests staying in the house - it was amazing!

For our wedding day we chose the 1776 package and all the suppliers included were phenomenal, we also used suppliers from the preferred supplier list who were all great too.

The team at Hedsor are just brilliant, we cannot thank them enough for their quick responses and never saying no to all of the ideas we had.

Thank you Hedsor for the Wedding of our dreams, Stefan & Katie xx"
V376,Hedsor House,"Best wedding venue I have ever found, and I’ve been looking for a very, very long time! (Long engagement). Their packages are phenomenal value for money for what’s on the market, their open days are like a dream (honestly), and their customer service is absolutely excellent. I have been in talks with Hedsor on and off for a number of years as we opted for a long engagement and wanted to save for this incredible venue. They have been incredible the whole time, have never pressured us to book, and always been so accommodating and patient with our questions over the last few years. They have supported us every step of the way in such a non-pushy way, and we have now finally secured our wedding date with them and I couldn’t be happier. The packages take care of almost everything, taking the pressure and stress out of organising numerous different vendors (flowers, cake, food, decorations, RJ etc) there is almost nothing not covered or catered for within their wedding packages.

I honestly have not one bad word to say about Hedsor and the team. Having been in communication with them for such a long time, I can say they are consistent, reliable and lovely to work with - 10/10 for everything so far!"
V376,Hedsor House,"We recently had our amazing wedding at Hedsor House and did one of their signature packages the ‘1776’ package. We honestly had the best day ever and our only complaint was it went too fast!!
All the Hedsor team were absolutely brilliant and couldn’t do enough for us!
We’ve had so many lovely compliments from our guests on the stunning house as well as how smoothly the day ran and a lot of our guests have said it was the best wedding they have ever been too!
We would thoroughly recommend Hedsor House to anyone looking for a wedding venue and once you set eyes on the stunning house you’ll see exactly why!
But not only is it an absolutely beautiful venue but all of the staff are so warm and welcoming too making it the perfect venue!
I wish we could do it all over again!!!"
V376,Hedsor House,"We simply cannot fault anything to do with our Wedding at Hedsor. Our wedding was initially booked for December 2020, and had to make the decision to postpone to December 2021. Jennie and the Team could not have been more supportive. In the run up to the day, Jennie was on hand for all of my questions no matter how big or small.
When the day finally came, all of the staff were excellent. A massive shoutout to Matt who made everything simply flawless. I didn't have to lift a finger.
For a truly special wedding venue, Hedsor will never disappoint."
V376,Hedsor House,"Dream wedding venue with the best staff. Stayed here for two nights, and couldn’t be more pleased. We adore everyone at Hedsor house. Thank you for making our experience a memorable one. We love you guys!"
V376,Hedsor House,"Dear Jennie and the Hedsor staff,

There are truly no words to describe how thankful we are for you all. Our wedding day was perfect and that’s all thanks to you.
Jennie, thank you for always listening to our wants for our day and your speedy response times. It always made planning from across the pond so much easier.
I never had any doubts about how smoothly our wedding day would go because I knew I was in good hands.
On the day of everyone commented on how helpful the whole staff was. All of our guests were blown away by literally everything about Hedsor.
I will forever recommend Hedsor and your team. I wish we could relive the day basically every day, Hedsor is the most magical place.
Thank you so much for making our day so magical.
Any couple getting married is so lucky they have incredible people like you making sure their day is perfect.
We hope you all had a Merry Christmas and a wonderful start to the New Year!
Much love,
Mara & Patrick
PS. Thank you for the beautiful cutting board and bottles of champagne. We get lots of compliments on the beautiful cutting board!"
V376,Hedsor House,"Hi Jennie, Katie and the Hedsor team,

Thank you so so much for everything you’ve done for us. We cannot thank you enough and also really appreciate your patience with us when going through the visa and rooming process. My mother and father in law were able to be there after flying in literally the night before and we could not have asked for a more perfect day.

Everyone absolutely loved the venue and we received so many compliments.

All the house managers were absolutely brilliant and just wanted to say a special thank you to Vic who walked me down from my bridal room and gave me some fantastic calming words of advice before I made my entrance. He was absolutely lovely and cannot thank the team enough for everything on the day and on the morning after.

The official pictures haven’t been released yet however I thought I would send you some casual ones from the day. I will of course send you them when they come out.

Thank you again and we hope you had a lovely Christmas and New Year break!

Very best,
Aiysha and Rehan"
V376,Hedsor House,"Dear Natasha & the wonderful Hedsor team,

Thank you so much for all you did to help make our special day truly unforgettable.

Since the first day we visited, we knew Hedsor House would make the most stunning venue and the house and gorgeous views took our guests breath away. It will forever hold the most incredible memories of our most perfect wedding day.
We are so grateful for all your guidance, assistance and professionalism leading up to the day. We felt we were in the best hands every step of the way and it was always such a joy to read your kind and thoughtful emails.
We are only sad that the fun of the wedding planning with you is over and want to do it all again. We will cherish Hedsor House forever and we cannot wait to be able to visit again soon.
Thank you again!

Lots of love,
Alice & David xxx"
V377,That Amazing Place,"We held a small family wedding (about 40 people) here and 'wow' the place and the team, particularly Angie, certainly were 'amazing'! The main house is beautiful and quirky and set in beautiful grounds, whilst the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. It was spotlessly clean and felt very exclusive with it being sited away from neighbouring properties. We felt the setting was idyllic for our wedding and would certainly recommend it to others."
V377,That Amazing Place,"We got married at That Amazing Place on 9/11/24
What can i say! 100% have your wedding here, you will not be disappointed. From first meeting Angie and the team in 2023, all the way through they were fantastic. We stayed in the beautiful cottage the night before. Our wedding morning, service, meal, evening everything was perfect.
Nothing was to much trouble, Angie and the team
Styled the venue perfectly, following my exact instructions and more. Words can not express how grateful we are for such a fantastic support team.
The venue is beautiful, it truly has its own personality. Every single guest commented the same.
Thank you so much Angie, Louise and team. You made our wedding exactly how we had dreamed xx"
V377,That Amazing Place,We got married at That Amazing Place in august 2024 and what an AMAZING place it is. The staff were all so friendly and An extra big thankyou to Angie and Louise who went above and beyond making sure our day was just how we wanted. Both Such lovely ladies and nothing was too much. Highly recommend this amazing place to everyone. Thankyou Keighley&James x
V377,That Amazing Place,"WOW - That amazing place.
Firstly, it certainly lives up to its name & more.


From the moment we booked to have our wedding day at TAP, we knew it was going to be special!

All the months of planning, Angie & Louise have been there every step of the way. Angie was always there on the end of an email or a phone call. To help, guide or advise!


We had our beautiful wedding day on Thursday 24th October and it was just incredible.
That amazing place, really is a special place and we feel so lucky and grateful to have got to have our wedding day there.
From the beautiful characteristisc house, to the beautiful marquee to the beautiful lake and outside grass it really has it all!

Every single one of the staff cannot do enough for you, Paul & all the team are just the loveliest people and we’re so friendly and helpful with anything we needed.




The actual day ran so smoothly with not a single hiccup and I truly beleive that was due to Angie & Louise’s efficiency! They were amazing from morning to night and constantly checked we were ok and if we needed anything.


We would reccomend this venue to anyone.. and if we could do our wedding again, we would do it here again & again.




We will always look back on our day knowing the venue was a pivotal part and with a big smile!


Thank you for everything!
All our Love,
Mr & Mrs Ackerman xxx"
V377,That Amazing Place,"Where do I start... me and my now wife got married at ""That amazing place"" and not to sound too corny, but it was amazing!

The decor was both elegant and warm, whilst the space was perfect for our cosy big day!

I don't think I could rate this place any higher, but the staff made our special day all the more magical! They offered a number of wedding packages which we were able to tailor to perfectly suit what we had dreamt of... they were also so accommodating to all of our needs and implemented them fantastically.

The venue has good disabled access, and the staff had ramps they were all too willing to move around, which helped my wheelchair using mum fully experience our big day to the fullest.

We chose to stay the night, and accommodation was clean and luxurious, not to mention the delicious breakfast the morning after.

This all added up to a 10 out of 10 day and lifelong memory, a wondrous experience for me and my new wife."
V377,That Amazing Place,We got married here in 2024. We had the most amazing day all coordinated by Angie and her amazing team! Everything about the venue was perfect and how we wanted it. We had our family dogs there too to top it all off!
V377,That Amazing Place,"We knew from when we first visited That Amazing Place that we wanted to get married there and on the day the venue really was everything we wanted it to be. Angie and the team we so great and made sure we had everything we needed.
All our guests loved the day and the place and we’re so happy with how everything turned out.
It was such a magical day and we wouldn’t have changed a thing!"
V377,That Amazing Place,"I honestly cannot recommend That Amazing Place more! Angie, Louise and the rest of the staff were incredible from start to finish. We first met Louise and Angie in February 2023 when they showed us around and we instantly knew we wanted to get married here. They couldn’t have made the experience more straightforward and stress free for us. On the day, everything was taken control of exactly how I would have wanted and everything ran smoothly thanks to Angie and Louise. Who are both so lovely and welcoming! The venue was spot on, the house is beautiful and the marquee was perfect for a party. Louise even drove us over the grass in a golf buggy to make sure we got some pictures outside without getting too wet due to the rain!
Absolutely loved staying in the wedding lodge the night before, stunning house and got everything you’d need (Angie and Louise came to say hello the night before also making me feel so relaxed about it all). Thank you so so much for everything you did for us and for making our day so perfect. Couldn’t have wished for a better venue. Lives up to its name!"
V377,That Amazing Place,"We visited a few venues before That Amazing Place, but when we met Louise and walked around the venue we knew straight away that this was the place for us.
We loved their relaxed style and felt we could really have the wedding that we wanted and it did not disappoint.
Angie helped us to organise our day and used her experience to help guide us into making some sensible decision. I really felt as though she listened to what we wanted and was willing to accommodate our plans.

On the day it was the wedding we had dreamed of. both Angie, Louise and the TAP team were on hand to make our day perfect. They beautifully set up the venue and went above and beyond to make sure we were happy throughout the day.
I couldn't be more thankful to them for helping to create our perfect wedding. I will forever be grateful to them."
V377,That Amazing Place,"Angie and Paul helped us plan the perfect wedding for us. It was the most amazing day, just what we wanted. Calm, chilled, relaxed, no stress and everyone was happy. They are highly recommended! We can not thank them enough!
Highly recommended!"
V378,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"Down Hall was our chosen venue for our wedding day in August - we had a wonderful day and the team did a great job looking after us and our guests.
We worked with Zoe as our wedding coordinator who was fantastic and responsive to our requests and communication as we planned the wedding in a short space of time in 5 months!
The chef was great and modified the menu to suit our special fusion wedding. The results were amazing with all our guests commenting on how wonderful the food was (my worst nightmare averted of guests feeling hungry or having a poor food experience!).
The whole experience with Down Hall was great. The hotel was very busy for the weekend over the summer which did not affect our wedding day itself as had a team dedicated to us. We also had a family afternoon tea arranged the day before instead of a rehearsal dinner which was also amazing with great service in our private room.
We hope to return for our first anniversary!"
V378,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"The summary I would give our wedding is that the venue is stunning however the wedding coordinators and bar staff failed on several occasions to deliver the wedding we had planned or paid for.

I really did not want to micro-mange my own wedding but this meant things didn’t go to plan. Luckily as we had evidence in writing we did receive compensation for this however that doesn’t change what happened on the day.


Here’s what happened …


Planning Issues

We emailed our final planning information 2 days prior to our final wedding planning meeting. We then had our final planning meeting with Tracy who said everything was okay and on-track. 10 days later she then admitted she had not read the documents at the time of the final planning meeting and had now found a problem. There was a problem, which was my misunderstanding, and we resolved this however this is a great example of the level of service that we received.

We had asked (thankfully via email) if we could have a musician outside during reception drinks and were told we were so we booked one. When we then visited Down Hall we were told we were not allowed a musician. As we could provide the email from them saying we could have a musician they allowed us to have one but I would recommend to any potential couples to get all communication in writing as you may need to provide what you have been told!

These are just two of several fustrating interactions we had during planning!


Time Management

The time management of the wedding coordinators is terrible. We were left waiting on every occasion that we met with them, sometimes up to 45minutes with no idea what was going on. On our wedding day we were left waiting in the reception room for 20minutes wondering again how long we would be waiting with many things to do!


Wedding Ceremony Music

We provided a detailed run-though of the wedding ceremony and when music was meant to be played (nothing complicated, pre-wedding, entrance, signing and exit songs).

- The pre-wedding ceremony music was not setup by the wedding coordinator as promised and was playing through the ipad and not speakers when the Groom arrived.
- Tracy then proceeded mid-way through the ceremony to randomly start playing the second signing music song before realising she was drowning out proceedings and switching it off.
- The Ceremony came to an end and everyone was asked to stand and out their hands together (this took quite a while as my Grandpa is disabled) despite this delay and being given a script in advance Tracy then totally missed starting the exit music until we were 3/4 of the way down the aisle.

The team did offer us compensation for this.


Horsebox Bar

We had paid £500 to reserve the terrace and horsebox bar. When we asked the Food & Beverage team to open the horsebox bar back up after the meal they had to apologise and say that there was a mix up and no staff had been booked and this was not possible.

After the wedding we then complained to the Revenue Manager who claimed that this was agreed with us and this was reflected on the function sheet which we received prior to the wedding … this was a totally untrue!

We then (rather embarrassingly for them) sent them their own function sheet and highlighted the line which said “horsebox bar and terrace after meal service”. After agreeing that both the contract and function sheet said this should be open they offered us compensation. Once again showing the importance of getting everything confirmed in writing.


Prosecco

We brought our own drink and did corkage. During the post wedding drinks I went to the horsebox bar to get a Prosecco to then be told that was the last glass. I was surprised given how much we had brought. I found two bottles in the dining room and took them to the horsebox bar. These were drunk and then guests started buying their own drinks as a result of being told this was finished.

I was then very disappointed to be handed back 8 bottles of Prosecco when we checked out. When I complained about this the Revenue Manger said the guests were drinking G&T which does not answer the complaint at all and again reflects the level of service we received.


Summary

In summary, the venue is stunning however from reading previous reviews it appears that a completely new wedding team are at Down Hall. I would only recommend this as a place to get married if you are going to micro-manage your wedding coordinator, get everything in writing, and don’t trust the function sheet as this is not guarantee things will happen."
V378,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"Wow what an amazing wedding we had at downhall, the venue was absolutely stunning and the team were amazing and always there for you along the whole journey. I could ask for more the whole day was an absolute dream and that wouldn't have been possible if not for the amazing team. Thank you so so much xxx"
V378,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"Down hall were amazing for mine & my new husbands wedding day! The whole day went so well and it was so so organised I couldn’t of felt in safer hands! Our wedding was cancelled twice due to the pandemic, and down hall were so accommodating in moving us we couldn’t complain! The only thing that went wrong was the music when I walked down the aisle temporarily stopped twice, I was so nervous for the day, I wanted the ground to swallow me up. But it wasn’t anyones fault it was just a technical glitch! But otherwise Becky, Imran & Julie especially we’re SO AMAZING I couldn’t of wished for a better wedding team! Loved it so much I’d do it all over again! And everyone commented on how accommodating & beautiful the venue was and how delicious the food was 😍 Even down the the Easter egg hunt the hotel had on the next morning for the children! It was absolutely perfect! You can tell they have all the experience! Loved it! We can’t wait to come back to stay for afternoon tea, some lush dinner & a spa day 😍"
V378,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"My husband and I got married at Down Hall in December 21. Covid cases just started to get bad again and even though Stu and I were a panicked mess in the days leading up to it, Becky, Imran and their dedicated team calmed every concern and we had the most incredible day. They are flexible, accommodating and the most reliable people I have ever met. No request was too much and they did absolutely everything they could to ensure that everything went ahead without fault. We met with the organisers the day before to discuss final details and they had everything written down and ready before we opened our mouths, even down the sticking down the sign on our post box. The smallest touches made the day magical and their attention to detail is unmatched. Because of them, we have the most fantastic memories of our day. Thank you so so much xx"
V378,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,We had the most magical wedding day! Would recommend this venue to everyone
V378,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"The Down Hall wedding team worked wonders for us when planning our special day. They’re caring, efficient and clearly have years of experience in organising weddings - the value of which cannot be underestimated. Organising a wedding in 2020 has at times felt like trying to pitch a tent in a storm only for it to be blown away given lockdown and a series of changes to wedding regulations. The team helped us to navigate the various covid regulations without letting them dominate our special day and did so with the utmost sensitivity.

The grounds and function rooms are stunning and offer a gorgeous backdrop for your ceremony, pictures and celebrations. The rooms are spacious and the Liddel suite in particular is a treasure trove of a room with all sorts of surprises including a romantic bathtub with views across the grounds. The food was delicious and the day was a success despite such difficult circumstances. Thank you Down Hall. We would not hesitate to recommend you for anyone planning a wedding in the future!"
V378,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"We got engaged in January then went to down hall on valentine a day I had been there before to stay and just knew I’d love to get married there so booked a meeting with a Julie and booked straight away the whole experience was perfect so professional and easy Julie was the reason for that she made it stress free . Our wedding day was perfect everything ran smoothly and just how I’d imagined we stayed from sat till Monday. Toast master Simon was amazing run the day brilliantly .
I would encourage anyone to get Married at Down hall perfect venue."
V378,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"Right from the start we was not even sure if we could have this fantastic venue, due to our small and intimate wedding. But to our delight, Down Hall tailored and accommodated our needs every step of the way. We must say all of the staff were brilliant in every way possible.
The food was perfect, and presented beautifully, and our guests loved it.
My husband and I had the most magical day. Once again we would like to give a massive thank you to all of the staff at Down Hall, for giving us a day that we will never forget."
V378,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"We couldn't have asked for a better day. All our friends and family are still talking about what an amazing day it was. Venue looked amazing, service was excellent and as for the beef it was exquisite.
From the moment we stepped into the venue it felt special and the wedding team made everything so easy building up to the day and on the day.
It was so good we want to do it again every year!"
V379,Newland Hall,"I'm not even sure where to begin but wow! We fell in love with this wedding venue just over a year before our wedding day and we looked at other venues but we kept comparing them all to Newland Hall. From the get go we had amazing email and phone calls with Lucy and Kelly. No question or query wasn't welcomed which I think any bride appreciates. We were able to meet with Lucy 5 weeks before our wedding day and also a few months before to refresh our memory and see the venue again before our big day which again felt just right and we picked our venue right. We were able to drop off decorations the day before our wedding (stuff for the tables, post box, seating plan, welcome sign etc) and Lucy as always greeted with us with such warmth and I think knowing Lucy was going to be there on the day made me feel so calm. Now the day. WOW. Thanks to Lucy she took what I had in mind for the tables, signs etc and made it perfect (better than I could) again no question or request was too big to ask. I had so many guests tell me how much they loved the venue and I'm hoping I can return to Newland Hall as a guest to take it all in again. The food was amazing and all of the staff working on my wedding were lovely (kept making sure I had eaten and I had a drink) If you're thinking of Newland Hall do it! I wouldn't change a thing. I want to do it all over again! Also want to mention the DJ was amazing! Music wasn't too loud which was good and he judged how well the songs were going to decide what to play next and he had a lot of patience for me as I had requested quite a lot music. I was also able to choose the music for after the wedding and dinner part which felt really personal."
V379,Newland Hall,"This Gem is tucked away in a quiet location in Chelmsford and I am glad that my partner found it randomly. When we went to visit the venue, we was blown away and very stunned at the beauty and peacefulness of the location.
The staffs, Kelly and Katerina were very professional, helpful and friendly. They truly made our day feel special. The venue was very flexible as we had to reschedule our wedding due to covid-19 restrictions on wedding. They also listened to us and our requests and tried their best to accommodate them within their capability.
We had an amazing day and thank you for making our day special!
Cloudier and Ryan"
V379,Newland Hall,"From the moment we arrived at Newland Hall for the Open day we knew we had found the perfect venue for our wedding and the actual event proved that right, and more.
Kelly and her team at Newland Hall were brilliant; in the run up to the event they were accommodating and flexible to our needs and on the day itself the whole thing ran beautifully making it a fabulous day for all involved, the ceremony was absolutely lovely and the reception and buffet that followed turned in to the relaxed and friendly garden party atmosphere that we had hoped for.

Thank you all again for a fantastic day.

Ian and Deb 23 August 2019"
V379,Newland Hall,We got married outside on 21.09.19 as the weather was perfect.! All our last minute changes were catered for by Katerina who was brilliant throughout. The venue is so pretty and perfect for what we wanted. The bbq food was lovely and the whole day flowed perfectly. Would definitely recommend.
V379,Newland Hall,"Amazing Venue, perfect for the intimate wedding we were looking for. Beautiful surroundings and 1st class service from the staff. Would highly recommend for anyone looking for a picturesque location. We married outside with the BBQ option which was amazing too! Thank you, Newland Hall!
Ella & Darren Crossman 5th September 2019"
V379,Newland Hall,"The most perfect wedding Venue, got married here on Saturday and had the best day, people could not stop complimenting the venue and the food and all the staff it was amazing. We had Fran as our wedding co-ordinator, and she was amazing and done such an amazing job. Everything went so well and it’s because of her, she set it all up just how I wanted it and she made sure I didn’t have to think about anything on the day. We had a lot of guests, 150 during the day and more in the evening, so she had her work cut out, but she really did amazingly, you could see how hard she worked. Thank you so much Newland Hall and most importantly Fran she was amazing. Couldn’t recommend this venue and Fran highly enough.
Becky & Daniel Harrington"
V379,Newland Hall,"We got married here on May Bank Holiday Monday and we could not be happier!
We chose Newland Hall because of the exclusivity, the beautiful house and outside space! We were married outside under the gazebo which we were able to decorate with flowers and sashes. The grounds are absolutely gorgeous, with plenty of photo opportunities, in and around the house, marquee and the nearby fields and lakes! The food was delicious and the guests were full of compliments! Our wedding planner, Fran, was absolutely amazing, she set the venue up and dealt with everything, making it completely stress free, for us and our guests! Nothing was too much! Thank you!
It’s a shame it’s all over, but thank you for being so accommodating! We would definitely recommend.
Jasmine & Dan Banks"
V379,Newland Hall,"WOW .....! What can I say?? We got married at Newland Hall on the 01.09.19 and it was the best day of our lives. I firstly want to thank Katerina our wedding coordinator for all her hard work in the lead up to the wedding and her organisational skills on the day really shone through, she was amazing from start to finish making our day even more special. I would also like to thank the director Simon for all his help in the run up to our wedding also. The food and service were second to none and everyone commented on the food. It was a truly amazing experience from start to finish. The staff were attentive and friendly and kept the drinks flowing so everyone could enjoy themselves. There were no long waits at the bar either which kept things flowing. A massive, massive thank you to everyone at Newland Hall for making our day that little bit more special, they really made us feel so special.
Mr & Mrs Swinney"
V379,Newland Hall,"Everyone who attended the wedding and reception said they had a fabulous time and dealing with Newland Hall and yourself has been a very thorough and enjoyable experience.

Thank you for everything you did and also to all of the other staff who helped make our wedding day such a great day."
V379,Newland Hall,"Thank you so much for everything, our day couldn’t have gone any better! We had so many guests saying to us what an amazing venue it is and also how great the staff are, and we obviously completely agree with them, we definitely made the best choice!"
V380,Creeksea Place,"We knew Creeksea would be the venue for us when we first happened to see pictures of the Manor and grounds online some years ago. From the moment we arrived for our appointment to meet with Claire who was helpful, friendly and flexible to try and make our day exactly as we wanted it. We kept in contact with Claire for any questions and checking ideas until we were allocated Carly as our coordinator. Carly was absolutely wonderful, answering texts and calls whenever things came up and reassured us to no end about the weather! Carly’s knowledge of the venue and talking to us, helped plan a really good day and we were so well taken care of by the team at Creeksea who linked in with our vendors so seamlessly.

We had never seen the venue in summer/sunlight before our wedding day and we were absolutely blown away with how gorgeous Creeksea is. Everything tied together and Carly kept us both so calm and relaxed throughout. Every guest we spoke to commented on how beautiful the venue is and how everything was just perfect, with one person asking “can you do this every week?”. If we could, we would. We cannot thank everyone enough and will remember the day forever.
Thank you again."
V380,Creeksea Place,"We had a twilight wedding at creeksea last month and it was absolutely perfect. We live locally and always knew we wanted to get married at creeksea as it’s such a hidden gem.
We booked only 5 months before the date so it was quite a short lead in time and as a result we had lots of questions! Claire was absolutely fantastic and responded to every query quickly and with a personal touch.
The whole process, from start to finish, was amazing. Nothing was too much trouble. The fact that creeksea isn’t one of these wedding venues that books numerous weddings a week resulting in you become more of a number than an actual wedding was worth its weight in gold. We were made to feel so special.
The day itself was amazing. It truly is the most breathtaking venue. Our guests were blown away with how beautiful it was.
The food truck in the evening was an absolute smash with the guests. The food was out of this world and everyone is still talking about how good it was.
We would recommend creeksea over and over again to anyone looking for the most beautiful and personal wedding, it’s truly spectacular and the service you receive simply cannot be compared.
It was the most magical day and we want to do it all over again."
V380,Creeksea Place,"Creeksea Place Manor House in BoC for us was simply the perfect choice location for our special day. Not only is this gem site local to us, the venue itself is stunning & the staff are professional, helpful & friendly. Although our wedding was small & intimate of which is what we wanted, it was still perfect, details for us included having use of the bridal suite for myself as the bride to get ready alongside my mother & best friend & for my husband he could relax & have a drink/catch up with the family before the ceremony feeling very relaxed. Lastly financially it was fantastic value for money & even if we decided to have the whole day/package for a larger wedding the pricing is still very reasonable."
V380,Creeksea Place,"This is the most gorgeous venue and we are so glad we chose it for our wedding venue. There are so many photo opportunities, and so many different options for ceremony backdrops. Claire, our wedding venue coordinator, was fantastic. She literally answered any question I had at all times of the day. She made our day run smoothly and helped it be the most perfect day. Cannot recommend this venue and the staff enough."
V380,Creeksea Place,"We had our twilight wedding here and the venue is absolutely breathtaking!! Clare and Carly were amazing!! I must’ve messaged Clare 200 times and each time I got a lovely and fast response. No stress approach and I really felt the excitement was shared (that they love what they do). Me and my partner are very much into heavy metal and abit morbid 😅 we incorporated this into our evening and everything was embraced with open minds and arms!. The staff were all wonderful, the food truck was incredible and everyone raved about their food so I cannot recommend them enough also. The lawn games were a massive hit too! Everything was just absolutely perfect and everyone had a fantastic time.

A massive thank you to all of the Creeksea team!"
V380,Creeksea Place,"We recently got married here and couldn't have asked for a better venue. The grounds & house speak for themselves, as soon as we saw it we fell in love, but the staff are the real stars. Nothing was too much hassle, they were so accommodating, responsive & helpful. Carly is fantastic & made sure everything went smoothly on the day. Claire was brilliant too & was great in the build up to the big day. They couldn't have done more for us. Highly recommend Creeksea to anyone and everyone! Thank you for making our day so special."
V380,Creeksea Place,"Had our wedding her on Thursday and despite the outbreak of rain, the team made alternative plans to accommodate us and our guests! Had a wonderful night, thank you to all the team for helping us coordinate our day effectively!!!"
V380,Creeksea Place,"My Husband and l absolutely fell in love with this wedding venue the 1st time we visited there. Its a stunning venue and truly is a hidden gem and brings happy emotions every time I see it. To top off such a stunning venue. I have to send massive compliments to all the staff. They make Creeksea extra special. From the day we put a deposit down to book our special day, until after our wedding day the Management have been the other end of the phone whenever we needed them, day or night. On the day every single staff member was on point they were attentive, friendly and almost felt like family.
Being an older couple in our 40's we booked a twighlight wedding package which was great value for money. This included street food which all our guests and us absolutely loved was so tasty and worth the money. Even the DJ was great that came as part of the package. He was in contact prior to our big day and tailored the music exactly to our preferences. We did spend more on some optional extras, like drink packages, lanterns etc but all still within our budget.
The best wedding venue by far around in my opinion and my guests couldn't believe how great Creeksea was too.
We definitely be re visiting at some point for a stay out of wedding season.
5 star + venue by far."
V380,Creeksea Place,"We instantly knew we were going to book Creeksea when we stepped through the entrance gates. A beautiful Tudor red brick building which felt hidden amongst tall enveloping trees. The perfect setting for our English fairytale wedding! Moving into the orchard we were again blown away by the intimate peaceful nature of this venue with rabbits wondering the grounds and the simple sound of birdsong to keep us company. In the lead up to our day Carly, Claire and the rest of the team couldn’t do enough for us. Responding to questions so quickly and giving us their experienced advice which meant we got the most out of our day. They were also very accommodating with requests such as including a ring warming ceremony (which we decided on three days before the wedding day!) and an outdoor sparkler last dance under their fairy-lit trees, a standout highlight from our day! We were originally drawn to Creeksea for its stunning natural beauty but now see the true gem of this place are the people that work there. We can’t wait to return for future anniversaries and already feel a part of the Creeksea family."
V380,Creeksea Place,"Wow !!!! Everything was absolutely gorgeous the grounds , the bridal cottage, the exquisite Manor House. Every expectation was met by Claire, Michelle And of course John Paul . The planning was spot on and we’ll taken care of . We asked lots and lots and lots of questions and everything was answered. All recommendations from food to fireworks to dj flowers and balloons all were exceptional. The team at Creeksea really do go above and beyond. We could not recommend any higher than we do . They worked within our budget and delivered everything to the T with all our requests. A truly beautiful location and absolutely lovely team , if there was a fairytale godmother for weddings Creeksea is it !!! Love Emma and Grant Wylde"

An amazing venue with great picturesque views."
V381,Rivenhall Oaks Golf Centre,"The venue met all our requirements, canapé and champagne reception, 3 course served meal and event buffet for our guests. The food and service was outstanding.

The DJ was excellent and kept the dance floor going all evening. The staff went above and beyond when they used there own cars to shuttle our guests to the coach that couldn’t get up the drive!

A big thank you to Kelly, Jack and all the team for making our day so memorable. A fantastic place to have your wedding reception, we wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone."
V381,Rivenhall Oaks Golf Centre,"All the guests loved the venue and setting. The food was great and plenty of it which made happy wedding guests. It all went to quick so we will have to do it again some day.

Once again, thank you for all your help getting family to the coach and yet again collecting us from the lane. Your team were amazing."
V382,Downham Hall,"We had our very small interment wedding reception at Downham hall and can honestly say that every single member of staff made our day exceptionally special.
Nothing was ever too much trouble with a member of staff always close by to see to our every need.
If you are considering booking your day or special event at Downham Hall please don’t hesitate as you won’t be disappointed.
Can’t thank you all enough, will definitely see you again soon"
V382,Downham Hall,"We got married at Downham Hall in July 2023 and cannot recommend this venue enough! The location, grounds, rooms and surrounding views are absolutely stunning.

The service was outstanding, the staff worked so hard to make sure everything ran smoothly on the day and were very helpful and informative during the planning process.

The wedding packages they offer are very comprehensive and flexible meaning you can make your wedding day bespoke to you. For example we wanted completely meat free (vegetarian) catering which they were more than happy to create a bespoke menu for us. You also get use of the bridal dressing room and overnight stay in the beautiful hotel rooms included.

I highly recommend you visit the venue to see it for yourself and if you do decide to book it for your wedding day, I’m sure you won’t regret it 💕"
V382,Downham Hall,"We had our wedding here 2 days ago. It’s a beautiful venue, the staff were great, really helpful, nothing was a bother when we asked them for anything. The food was fabulous and the accommodation is lovely. I would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a venue in Essex."
V382,Downham Hall,"We had an extremely tiny, completely bespoke wedding day at Downham Hall. It was absolutely perfect and everything we had hoped it would be. Christina, Debra and all the staff were amazing from start to finish and nothing was too much trouble. I cannot recommend Downham Hall highly enough. We have been back numerous times since. It’s like coming home."
V382,Downham Hall,"After two cancelled dates due to Covid at another venue, my (now) husband and I decided we were tired of waiting and got in touch with the team at Downham Hall just 5 weeks before we were going to tie the knot.

They really couldn’t have done more to accommodate our last-minute request. The team made us feel so so welcome, the venue was stunning, the food incredible and we had the most amazing day.

I really couldn’t recommend Downham Hall more!"
V382,Downham Hall,"Downham Hall proved to be the perfect choice of wedding venue. It's a beautiful country house with stunning grounds and an amazing team, who went above and beyond from start to finish, to make our day perfect. Genuinely can't recommend highly enough.

We were able to choose exactly what food we wanted for our wedding Breakfast and evening meal (even allowing us to provide our own signature cocktail to our guests!) The staff were very attentive throughout the day and the breakfast the morning after with our closest family was amazing! Would highly recommend as a wedding venue. We both still enjoy going back to the venue for meals and afternoon teas now, the views are beautiful and food always amazing!"
V382,Downham Hall,"Oooo I cant believe its been 2 years since our Wedding at Downham hall. The venue was perfect. They had the most beautiful room with fireplaces that i knew i wanted to get married in. The gardens look beautiful no matter what the season. There is just so much character in the building and the grounds surrounding Downham hall. Everyone at Downham hall are friendly and helpful, its so lovely that Christina and Andrew are so invested in all their guests. Everything on the day ran perfectly, which I knew it would. The food!

V383,Marygreen Manor Hotel,"We had our Wedding Reception at Marygreen Manor Hotel with family and friends in from the U.S., South America, and the UK. The Hotel, venue, and staff were amazing to us from the planning stage or our wedding, which we were doing from the US, to our actual wedding date. They offered bilingual staff, incredible service and professionalism to both us and our guests. The venue is gorgeous and our wedding pictures really highlighted the beauty of Marygreen Manor.

We suggest all to visit the Marygreen Manor for dinner and /or to stay with them and experience the Manor yourself."

V384,The Manor at Bickley,"The Manor is the perfect venue for weddings! When our wedding venue fell through 4 months before the big day, I stumbled onto the Manor at Bickley and spoke to Craig. He was most helpful and kind and went above and beyond to make sure our wedding went ahead.

We hired the venue for our two day wedding and the staff were helpful and accommodating from start to finish. All of our guests were awed by the beautiful well kept grounds and the excellent service. We can’t thank the staff enough for making our wedding dreams a reality. They thought of every detail from bringing us champagne after our civil ceremony to making sure we had our card box at the end of the night! We are excited to head back to celebrate our anniversary there!"
V384,The Manor at Bickley,"Myself and my Husband chose this venue for our wedding last week and we can’t sing The Manor’s praises enough. From our very first enquiry, to the first viewing of the venue, right though until the big day, the staff at the manor have been nothing short of brilliant! Each staff member we came across was polite and accommodating. Special mention to Craig and Vicky with whom we did most of our liaising throughout the months leading up until our wedding. Craig and Vicky were super helpful, responsive and went above and beyond to make sure that we could have the day of our dreams. Even with last minute changes due to the weather, Craig who was just incredible throughout, managed to help us sort a backup plan so our day would still go ahead seamlessly.

The rooms at the manor were spacious and modern, giving us and our wedding party lots of space for photographers and videographers to capture the special moments on our wedding morning.

The lodge that was used for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready was fabulous. The manor was very flexible in giving us early access so we could get ready on time.

The grand marquee was definitely grand! Very spacious and when decorated looked like something out of a fairytale! lots of kitchen space, a huge bar and fantastic overhead speakers for the party!

The manor was super flexible to our needs regarding access, start times, outsourcing our vendors and much more. The venue is beautiful and spacious with options for outdoor and indoor events and entertainment. The grounds were absolutely beautiful, so many lovely spots for photos not only for us as the bride and groom but for guests too!

A very special thank you to our point of contact throughout, Craig. From our first meeting, he was charming, bubbly and made us feel super welcome. He reassured us that he has experience in African/Caribbean weddings and that our wedding day would amazing and it was. He was attentive and always let us know that he was only a phone call or e-mail away and was always quick to respond and answer any questions we had.

All in all, we had the most beautiful day at The manor and we would definitely recommend this venue for a wedding or other events.

Nkechi & Harold"
V384,The Manor at Bickley,"We hired The Manor at Bickley for my daughters wedding. Got a brilliant service from the venue. Everything was set accordingly, as per floor plan. Our guests were loved the venue grounds/facilities and the overall wedding set up.
Thank you to everyone at Bickley."
V384,The Manor at Bickley,"A warm and friendly service from the very helpful staff, a feeling that it is your own house! The food was amazing and the atmosphere made us and our guests feel fantastic."
V385,Channels,"No words could describe how beautiful and stunning Channels Estate is. Right from the very start of viewing Channels all the way to our wedding day, we were made to feel comfortable. The communication was absolutely amazing and they helped make our day a very special day. Katie was our coordinator, she was kind, sweet and helped us make our day one to remember. We would highly recommend Channels Estate

Mr & Mrs Edwards"
V385,Channels,Katie made our dream come true. She was attentive and organised which made the running of our day feel so smooth and organic. The venue itself is stunning and luckily we had nice weather which just made the day even better. Everyone loved the food and the service was excellent. Couldn’t have asked for more.
V385,Channels,"Channels provided a great experience throughout. The team (led by Karen) were extremely helpful throughout - they accomodated all of our needs, worked well with the suppliers and coordinated the day brilliantly. Venue was set up beautifully and food was of a high standard. On site hotel rooms were luxurious and reasonably priced for our guests. Would recommend the venue without question."
V385,Channels,"We got married 31st March 2023 at channels, from the moment we booked channels Karen and her team were incredible, communication was great all the way through. Our actual day was fantastic from morning till night Karen and all the staff were helpful, friendly and just couldn't do enough for us and our guests! Would highly recommend channels"
V385,Channels,"Wedding Day - 9th April 2023
Couldn't be happier with the venue and how our wedding day went, Karen and the rest of the staff were brilliant and took care of everything for us and always made sure we were alright and that it all went perfectly. They were lots of fun and we couldn't recommend them highly enough. Thanks!"
V385,Channels,"The venue is stunning, food is beautiful. And the staff are welcoming happy and seriously can not do enough for you.
Nothing is too much.
Can not rate this place enough."
V385,Channels,"What a perfect day we had, marrying at The Channels Estate. A couple of months before our wedding day, our wedding co-ordinator needed to be changed. We were handed over from Molly to Katie, and the handover couldn't be smoother. Both Molly before, and Katie once handed over couldn't have been more helpful. A couple of weeks before our day I began to have bride jitters about the planning and organisation of decoration etc. Katie replied to my email very quickly, putting my mind at ease.
On our big day, Hayley and Karen couldn't have been nicer and more helpful. Hayley single handedly tidied the outside area before our ceremony as it had been left quite a mess from the previous wedding the day before, and Karen was on hand following the ceremony with the electric swatter to deter any wasps after the Pimms! Every member of staff we spoke with was lovely and did all they could to ensure we had the most wonderful and calm wedding day. Channels is a beautiful venue, I just wish we could do it all again! Thank you all :)
Jasmine and Dave x"
V385,Channels,"I am a little late in writing this review as we got married in September 2021. It truly was the best day ever and we are so glad that we chose Channels for our wedding day. We knew it was the venue for us, from our first visit where we met with Paul and he showed us around. The venue had everything we wanted, a beautiful barn, great grounds and lots of gorgeous accommodation, which was a must for us. We stayed the night before in The Retreat, which was amazing, with lots of room for us to get ready and although the weather was not on our side, and we could not get married in the ceremony garden, in the end it didn't really matter. Molly was our coordinator and she was incredible. It was like she could read my mind, and everything was exactly as we wanted, without us even having to think about it. The day went by in a flash and the venue looked amazing. We didn't have to think or worry, it all just happened seamlessly. The staff worked so hard and the food was amazing. All our guests had the best time and were so complementary about the venue and they loved the accommodation. It really was perfect the day. The best part is that, as it's not just a wedding venue we can visit again if we want to and book to stay in the hotel for our anniversary. Also must not forget to mention James who works at the hotel. He must have rearranged our accommodation booking so many times and was so kind and helpful. We had to postpone by 6 weeks due to a member of our immediate family becoming temporarily ill. James, Paul and Molly were very understanding while we tried to rearrange our wedding day to work with all our guests and suppliers. 10/10"
V385,Channels,"Wow! What can I say?! There are quite literally no words to explain how wonderful channels is. From start to finish, Paul, Eleanor and the whole team could not have been more friendly and accommodating. They took our vision and made it reality without breaking the bank too much. Every single element was perfect from food to decor to operation. It was faultless. Everyone adored the food and said just how beautiful it looked. Thank you to the most wonderful team! We appreciate you so much!

If you’re considering channels…….just do it!"
V385,Channels,"Channels staff were fantastic both in the planning of the day and organisation on the actual wedding day, we couldn’t fault them. Staff were friendly, helpful and proactive. The wedding day was amazing and so many people commented that it was the best wedding they’d been too.

We planned our wedding for what turned out to be during the pandemic. Channels were so proactive, responsive and helpful with rearranging our day, and even helpful with our wedding insurance claim for the rearrangement.

It’s a stunning venue with plenty of outside space. We’d thoroughly recommend it :)"
V386,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"Firstly Christie and Sarah the Wedding Coordinators were so friendly and couldn’t do enough for us on and before our wedding day! They were so approachable and personable. The staff at Greenwoods were all so friendly, helpful and genuinely cared about us having the best wedding day it was so very appreciated! All of the staff, from the maintenance and support staff right through to the management went above and beyond to make our stay and wedding the best experience. One lady cleaning our room went out of her way to help us with getting extra towels and bits we needed on my wedding day. Another gentleman who served us for breakfast also went above and beyond to upgrade us to a better room because our TV and electric went off in our bridal suite and they wanted us to have the best experience, which was such a nice touch and honestly made our experience so much better! Cannot fault the place! 5 stars!!!"
V386,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"Everyone has commented to me how gorgeous our wedding venue was and they aren’t lying.
Service was second to none, every staff member in that building treated me like I was a celebrity throughout my stay there for our wedding and I will never forget it!
Special mention to Shannen who looked after us thoroughly throughout wedding planning

V386,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"We got married at Greenwoods recently and I all can say is wow and thank you!!

Our day ran perfectly and that’s solely down to the staff here - some of who were working all day - but even by the end of our night, nothing we asked for was too much trouble.

The food was outstanding - we had many guests comment on how great it was especially seeing as they were catering for 100+ guests - it didn’t feel like a typical ‘large event’ meal but something you would expect in a restaurant.

The venue is perfect, beautiful grounds and a stunning garden suite and there was no stress for my husband and I as everything was looked after, the staff clearly have a lot of experience in weddings as they were there and ready for the next part of the day before we were!

I couldn’t recommend Greenwoods enough to any couples thinking of choosing it as their wedding venue!

Thank you again!"
V386,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"Cannot put into words just how perfect this was. 2 night stay plus wedding ceremony, reception and evening. The attention to detail was fantastic. Venue stunningly beautiful. Food was lovely and service very good. Wedding coordinator was excellent. It really was just perfect"
V386,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"Perfect venue for a perfect wedding.
The whole day ran like clockwork and nothing was too much trouble for the staff team as we were gently directed throughout the day. My niece looked beautiful and happy as she walked up the aisle in the lovely gardens.
We had a brilliant time and at the end of the day an extremely comfortable bed.
Thank you so much."

V386,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"It was faultless from the moment we arrived to the moment we left.
Great rooms, more than pleasant staff (who bent backwards to accommodate the six of us plus two children under 5 ) the wedding, the wedding reception, the food and then the great breakfast in the morning
I would highly recommend this place !"
V386,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"This is a gem of a place which deserves much wider recognition.
Don't usually write reviews but felt compelled to break my code of silence for this experience. My daughter chose Greenwoods Hotel & Spa as her preferred choice of venue for her wedding reception.
From the moment she and her entourage arrived at 7.30am on the day of the wedding the staff could not have been more helpful. The level of service and attention to detail were exceptional. Shannon, the hotel's wedding co-ordinator, was on hand throughout the day and evening giving re assurance, confidence and updates on timings and procedures which is what you need on days like these. Such a cool mature head on young shoulders!
Food and silver service at the wedding breakfast were impressive and plenty of bar staff on hand throughout the evening so none of those unseemly 'scrums' ever developed at the bar for drinks; and the Garden Suite function room literally takes your breath away when decorated.
Overnight accommodation did not disappoint and breakfast plentiful.
So if you are planning a wedding put Greenwoods on your short list. You won't regret it."
V386,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"We recently got married at Greenwoods. From start to finish it was a perfect experience. The Library room was stunning, the reception room was beautiful. Nothing was ever too much trouble. All the staff on the day were happy, helpful and brilliant. The food received constant compliments - it was delicious!!!!
As a very nervous bride I wouldn't have been without Shannen - our wedding coordinator. She was simply amazing - made me feel relaxed and really special - i just loved the care and attention. The whole day went without a hitch and Shannen and the team even delivered beautiful sunny weather! We are so so pleased we picked Greenwoods for our wedding. We cant wait to head back for a stay on our anniversary! Thank you everyone!! love, Michelle and Jon xxxx"
V386,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"Chris and i would just like to say a huge thank you to you and all the staff involved in making our wedding the best day of our lives. The day ran so smoothly and that is all thanks to you and the amazing team at Greenwood’s. So many of our guests have commented on the day from how beautiful the venue was decorated, to the delicious food and the friendly staff.

The day completely surpassed our expectations and we we cannot thank you enough for making it the most special and amazing day of our lives.

Thank you again,

Chris and Helen"
V387,Crondon Park,"In terms of the beauty of crondon park you can see for yourself...

But the care of the people that work there were unbelievable. Honestly, nothing is too much for them. You are paying a lot to get married (anywhere!) but somehow most people still feel embarrassed to ask lots of questions or things they don't understand. Crondon never made us feel bad for asking questions and clarifying things, asking for adjustments and just being reassuring.

They were so helpful on the lead up, everything was clear and on the day they were faultless. I'd definitely recommend them to anyone!

We had 103 guests so on the higher side and it was still plenty of space.

The food was also incredible!"
V387,Crondon Park,"It was an amazing day! The place looked stunning.
Thank you for your hard work. You have made our special day incredible"
V387,Crondon Park,We had the most special day! I honestly do not think I could have changed a thing!! We were so well looked after for the entire day
V387,Crondon Park,"We had an absolute fantastic day, everything ran smoothly and staff was so helpful and friendly. Jo our front of house was lovely and helped us throughout the day, even when my veil needing securing she was able to help. We would highly recommend Crondon Park, our day was so special and would love to do it all again xx"
V387,Crondon Park,"My partner and I first visited the venue after getting engaged back in February 2023. We were greeted by Kara, who was nothing short of friendly and supportive. It was one of the first venues we had seen and booked the next day.

The process towards the big day was excellent. We would regularly be in contact with Ellie who would also answer any questions or queries we had. The communication was always quick and reassuring. We came to a few afternoon tea and special dinners they organise to get more of a feel for the place and we knew we had made the right decision.

As for the big day itself on 12.4.25, well it was absolutely perfect. Our front of house Jo, was nothing short of amazing, professional, friendly and went above and beyond what we expected. Thank you Jo! The food was absolutely delicious, the service was impeccable. A big thank you to all the chefs, waiters, cleaners and anyone else who was involved behind the scenes to make our big day so magical. The rooms were also amazing for our guests, as well as the Lily Suite, that me and my friends stayed in the night before. And of course, the honeymoon suite too.

We cannot thank Crondon Park enough for making our wedding so special. If we could do it all again, we would. Who knows maybe a renewal of vowels one day? :D

We would highly recommend this venue to any couple. 5 star service from start to finish. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you Crondon Park! The big day and experience will be cherished in our memories forever."
V387,Crondon Park,"I would like to say a huge thank you to the team at Crondon Park for making our wedding the most amazing smooth-running day. And a special thank you to Kayleigh and Kara, it truly shows how passionate you are about your Job.

Having our wedding at the beginning of December, Crondon Park had already had their Christmas touch décor up, the sun going down early made the fairy lights extra magical.

From the moment we booked the team were very attentive and reliable at getting back to emails throughout the months leading up to the wedding. I’m a big believer that communication is the key, and they had made everything stress free. They met our every need and went above and beyond to accommodate our requests.

Our guests are still talking about it until this day, the food had high compliments, even heard it was the best brownie they had ever tasted!

No words can explain this day in a nutshell, but I will say, if you are considering booking this Venue for your special day, then please do not hesitate!

Eve & Roberto xxx"
V387,Crondon Park,"A fantastic day, really well organised, great venue and fantastic food and service! Thank you so much for helping make it an amazing day"
V387,Crondon Park,"Wow, absolutely fantastic day from start to finish.
Beautiful rooms, lovely food and service.
Lovely breakfast the next day a well.
Perfect!!"
V387,Crondon Park,"Such a great wedding, good vibes, i would definitely recommend!
I also have several allergies that the staff dealt with easily, extremely helpful.
Thank you all so much"
V387,Crondon Park,"We had the most perfect day, thank you so much for everything.
It was just amazing! Every one of our guests constantly said what a beautiful venue it was. We both really appreciate all the hard work everyone put into not just yesterday but over these last 2 years."
V388,Villiers Barn,"I don’t think the words I’m trying to find even exist in the dictionary, to describe this truly breathtaking, spectacular, unique, initiate venue - VILLIERS BARN is out of this world and that’s all down to Juliet & Barry, the Venue owners & directors & their son Jonathan who offer a 7-star, first class service. All three are extremely passionate about their business & they go above and beyond from the moment we viewed, booked & then had our wedding (last Thursday), no job was too big for them.

We viewed VILLIERS during its renovation & as soon as we drove up the lane, there was something so very special about where we had just arrived, historic, traditional - but different from any other typical barn wedding venue I’d seen online / been to as a guest. VILLIERS holds something special & unique.

VILLIERS was the first & only venue we viewed - we knew it was the one for us. We went back to see progress & it just kept getting better and better. I can’t praise the venue, the setting, the owners & staff enough.
We had an Amalfi (Italian) Coast themed wedding, the barn is simply stunning & speaks for itself - our theme fitted in perfectly, but as would any other theme over the last year I’ve seen villiers host many weddings & no two weddings have been the same it’s incredible - versatile VILLIERS! 👏🏽

Every time we viewed VILLIERS after booking, I felt so choked in the ceremony room, the barn, by the lake as I just knew this was the only place I see myself getting married to my fiancé, our wedding day was perfect & we have had fabulous comments from family and friends - saying it was the best venue & best wedding they’d ever been to, spectacular settings & top class service and so well organised.

To Juliet, Barry & Jonathan and their wonderful staff - your passion shines through & we can’t thank you enough for having us & making our day perfect, I’m so sad our wedding day is over - but the memories we’ve created will last forever & will play out like a film in our minds.

I can’t recommend VILLIERS BARN enough, if you want the best wedding, then book the best venue.

Thank you all again,

Harriette & Charlie Blackshaw-Clare 🤍🍋💙"
V388,Villiers Barn,"Where do I even begin with this beautiful venue?! From the very first visit to Villiers Barn, we knew this was the venue for us! The whole family were super friendly and helpful when showing us around after the first viewing we were hooked and knew we had to have our wedding here!

Throughout the whole year Jonathan was especially helpful with all the communications, questions and on hand to help with anything, nothing was too much trouble!

When it came to the wedding day everything happened with such ease, Jonathan, Becky and Ellen were on hand and made the day super smooth including the help setting up the venue making it perfect!! They gave us the wedding day of our dreams! It couldn't have been more perfect and everyone was so attentive in getting our drinks, taking us where we needed to be, the food was INCREDIBLE also and will be dreaming of that for a lifetime! Also the new seating area outside with the log heart is a lovely touch!

I couldn't recommend this venue highly enough and can't thank everyone at Villiers for the most memorable day!"
V388,Villiers Barn,"5 stars is not enough. We got married here on 22nd March 2025 and from the moment we booked the whole team were so responsive and helpful. The whole day went so smoothly thanks to the incredible team. A big thank you to you all for helping set the venue up exactly as we wanted and talking the time to ask questions where needed. The food was delicious and the portions were perfect, we received comments all day long from our guests saying how much they enjoyed all the food and drink on offer. The venue itself is absolutely stunning. Neither ourselves or our guests wanted for anything all day long as the service was outstanding. Truly thank you for helping us have one the best days of our lives."
V388,Villiers Barn,"We got married in Villiers Barn on November 7th 2024.

The minute we viewed the barn back in September 2022, we knew this is the place we were going to say ‘I do’.
Juliet, Jonathan and all of the team that work at Villiers are absolutely incredible!
2 years of constant communication, answering any questions we had and just checking in on us, this made our countdown even more exciting!

The BIG day arrived and we couldn’t have asked for anything more. The day ran smoothly and I would even say perfectly!
Jonathan was incredible, letting us have our time we needed, checking everything was okay and when we wanted to do certain timeline of events if we were busy talking to guests (or even dancing away), there was no pressure.

Not forgetting the Venue & grounds are stunning in itself & with the amazing team you’d be silly not to book to have your wedding here!

I’ve told everyone it was the best day of our lives and it truly was! Thank you for making our day amazing, I will never forget the dedication of the team for making our day so special and personal to us. 🤍

Shaun & Ellice
Mr & Mrs Baker"
V388,Villiers Barn,"Villiers Barn is an absolutely stunning wedding venue with so much rustic charm! From the moment we booked, the team went above and beyond to make everything perfect, and Juliet in particular was incredible—so helpful, kind, and attentive throughout the whole process. The food was fantastic, fresh and beautifully presented every detail felt thoughtfully planned. If you're looking for a beautiful, welcoming venue with a brilliant team, Villers Barn is the perfect choice."
V388,Villiers Barn,"Wow where do we even begin?

We got married at Villiers Barn in December & it was truly our dream venue. After visiting a few venues in Essex & Suffolk (which hadn’t ticked all our boxes), Villiers was the last venue we visited & wow we did save the best until last! The venue itself is gorgeous and suitable for any wedding across the seasons. The venue has a mix of a classic/rustic feel but also really modern and elegant. We fell in love as soon as we saw it. Juliet showed us around initially & we fell in love with her too!! She is so passionate about what she does & cares so much about you, making you feel so welcome! She makes you feel so special and taken care of. We loved that Villiers is also a family run business & knew this was the venue for us.

We really can’t fault the Villiers Barn Team.…Jonathan was BRILLIANT at providing information and responding to all our questions over the two years we spent planning. His replies were always so quick and this was honestly so reassuring for us, and made us feel like we were in very safe hands. He arranged our taster evening for us (which we highly recommend) where we essentially had a private dinner date at the venue, tasting the food options. He also helped arrange any visits we wanted at the venue in the lead up.

Becky helped us to set up the day before our wedding & also co-ordinated the wedding day for us with Juliet. We can’t thank Becky enough for all the help, support & love she showed not only us but all our bridal party and guests. She went above and beyond to make sure everything ran seamlessly for us (along with the rest of the Villiers team we had on the day).

The day itself ran so smoothly, with all our guests complimenting us on how beautiful the venue was. Even in the storm, wind & rain, the venue is just beautiful. We also had such delicious food that came out piping hot - all our guests were raving about how good the food was throughout the day.

At the end of the wedding day, we stayed in the honeymoon lodge accommodation which was so convenient & so lovely waking up the next morning with breakfast already prepared for us.

We really had the best day and are so grateful to everyone at Villiers Barn! We can't thank you enough! We really hope we get to visit again as guests for a wedding in the future.

Lots of love from Mr & Mrs Stanway xx"
V388,Villiers Barn,"Villiers barn wedding venue will always hold a special place in our hearts after our big day on 25th October 2024

Jonathan was so supportive, helpful and had so much knowledge whenever we needed guidance whilst planning our big day. We also met Jonathan’s mother, Wife and sister who were equally helpful if needed.

As soon as we see the venue we fell in love and knew we wanted villiers to host our special day. The venue has a really warm feel to it. The grounds and barn are spectacular and the attention to detail was out of this world

We cant thank everyone at villiers enough for helping make such a special memorable day. We loved every second."
V388,Villiers Barn,"From the moment we went and visited the venue, we were in awe of how beautiful it is.

Still, that means very little without a wonderful team, and Villier's Barn delivers in spades. Jonathan, Juliet, Becky, and everyone else we've dealt with were unbelievable.

From Jonathan answering our millions of questions as we approached the big day, to Juliet being so warm and helpful when dropping off our assorted decorations, to Becky literally putting on buttonholes right before the ceremony, we couldn't have asked for a better experience.

Everything ran smoothly, the staff were helpful throughout the day, and nothing was ever too much trouble. My wife and I are genuinely a little sad we can't do it all over again!"
V388,Villiers Barn,"Villiers Barn was the first and only venue we viewed. It was absolutely breathtaking from the minute we viewed it. The staff were very warm and welcoming. We then booked it and throughout the whole process nothing was too much trouble for the Villiers Barn Team. They did an amazing job on the day of our wedding and met and went above and beyond our expectations and we are extremely grateful.
The biggest of thank you's to Juliet, Jonathan & Becky.
All our love Richard & Chanel x"
V388,Villiers Barn,"Where do I begin? Villiers Barn was the only venue we viewed. To when my Fiancé proposed and I found the venue through my photographer I knew I’d found the place I wanted to get married in.

From our viewing with Juliet, we signed on the dotted line there and then. Jonathan was then a constant communication path for my 1000s of questions over the next 3 years. If I could give 1000*s I would, Jonathan was our rock! He would answer every question, provide every detail, no request was to much trouble and I genuinely felt so calm throughout the whole process.

The family team at Villiers care about your wedding day as much as you do, you’re treated like royalty & your guests will have the most incredible day. Down to the morning of the wedding Becky was just amazing, making sure me and my bridesmaids had everything we needed. To the ceremony and day when Jonathan had everything coordinated. My glass was always topped up, food was served by the masses and was incredible. Our music played through out the day and the little moments we had in our honeymoons lodge for some time to ourselves was so special. Jonathan and his wonderful wife & partner made sure everything was packed for us to ferry away the following morning, they even arranged special gift we received while staying at the lifehouse spa after the wedding.

I want everyone I know to get married at Villiers so they can experience the most incredible day as we did.. and of course catch up with our Villiers family.

Thank you again for absolutely everything, words simply aren’t enough. All of our love always Samantha & Adam xxxxx"
V389,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"Amy, Vicky and Laura were absolutely amazing throughout the whole process of my wedding, the planning, the lead up and the day itself. Nothing was ever too much trouble and they were always very quick to respond to any queries we had.
The staff at The White Hart are amazing and made me feel very calm and comfortable while getting ready for our big day in the amazing bridal getting ready room, which was one of the highlights of the day as there is so much space for everyone with make-up artists and hair stylists etc meaning there was zero stress.
The food was great all round, we had a meal the night before, the wedding breakfast and breakfast the day after were all just amazing, cannot fault anything with it.
Honestly the best day of our lives, so glad we choose this venue to get married, we would highly recommend to all!!"
V389,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"From the moment we booked our wedding at The White Hart, Laura was nothing short of exceptional. She not only helped us arrange every detail but also provided us with fantastic recommendations for photographers, entertainment, transport options, and venue decorators. Her communication was always swift and thorough, and she answered every question we had, making the entire process seamless from start to finish.

On the wedding day, our heartfelt thanks go to the wedding coordinators, Vicky and Amy who ensured everything ran smoothly and took the time to review every minute final detail with us a week before the big day. They managed every aspect of the day from start to finish, making sure everything was perfect. They both, along with their staff assisted guests with check-ins and helped (early - considering a late finish) with breakfast the following morning—going above and beyond in every way.

Thank you also to Luke and Bradley, for their incredible support. Luke, in particular, made my wife feel like the most important person on the planet. His care and attention was extraordinary, making my wife feel like she was the only bride to have ever gotten married at The White Hart. For also, calming me on my walk up to the venue, thank you. The personal touch he added to the day for us both made it truly unforgettable.

I’d also like to offer a special thank you to Vicky, who provided me with much-needed emotional support on the morning of the wedding. She was there to reassure me, address my concerns, and help calm my nerves—exactly what I needed before greeting guests, sat anxiously waiting for my arrival followed by my Niamh's arrival.

As someone who was feeling a little anxious leading up to the day, I couldn’t have asked for a better team of professionals. With them running everything, we were in great hands. Our wedding day ran exactly how we envisioned it, and it was nothing short of perfect! From the management to the chefs and waitstaff, every detail was thoughtfully taken care of, and it was the most magical day of our lives.

A huge thank you to the entire team for making our day not only flawless but incredibly special. We truly couldn’t have asked for more & we will regularly visit for a the extraordinary food and drink on offer.

All our love & support,

Ryan & Niamh X"
V389,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"We had our twighlight wedding on 19 October 24 and everything about it was perfect and magical. The staff were fantastic in terms of planning and on the day, nothing was too much trouble, particular mention for Laura, Vicki and Amy 😊"
V389,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"We just had our wedding day at The White Hart and all I can say is EXCEPTIONAL! from the day we booked Laura was always on hand to help us and answer any questions we had about our day or the venue. So attentive she even worked late to help us secure a new DJ after issues with our original one. She went above and beyond through the whole planning process. She is a calming influence and incredibly organised and professional which is just what you need when planning a wedding. OUTSTANDING SERVICE! Additionally the front of house staff on the day were all incredible and made everything run seamlessly throughout the day and late into the night. Vicky and Amy, you two were amazing! We can’t thank you enough for making it even more perfect than either of us could have imagined. You are all superhero’s and I’m so impressed that even the tiniest of details and planning were followed exactly as I had asked. I can’t thank you all enough. If you are planning to get married and want the confidence of knowing your venue and it’s staff have your back and will make your day exactly how you picture it then look no further than The White Hart! Best venue ever! ❤️❤️❤️"
V389,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"Got Married in July 2024, from start to finish Laura our wedding day coordinator was amazing with fantastic attention to detail, our day went so smoothly with Amy and Viki as our wedding day managers, all of our guest raved about all three courses.
The grounds were absolutely stunning for our photos along with there five star accommodation,

Well done white hart team for making our day so special , we can’t wait to celebrate our anniversary with you!
⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
V389,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"Our wedding was brought together with the expertise of Abbi, Laura & the whole white Hart team. The day ran so smoothly and everything was on point like clockwork! They helped answering any questions we had and went the extra mile when needed. If we could we would get married here all over again-fab venue and value for money!"
V389,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"The Barn at the White Hart is amazing, a beautiful setting and welcoming environment. The process was easy and they were patient with me and my many questions. The meetings were eye opening for details we had never even thought about, but so worth it!

The wedding itself was more than we could have ever dreamed of, everything ran so smoothly! This meant that we could enjoy ourselves and not worry about anything, the team had everything we needed and were so accommodating.

Everyone commented on how much they enjoyed themselves and all were amazed by the food, it was as good as it always is.

We cannot thank everyone at the White Hart enough!"
V389,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"There wasn't a moment during our planning with the White Hart, or the day itself where we didn't feel cared for. Originally, we chose to view it as thank to its website we knew it welcomed LGBT couples. From our first meeting. we were made welcome and everything was done to make sure neither one of us were sacrificing just because there were two brides!
The barn was perfect and the suggested DJ is phenomenal and great at reading a room. Even though it rained, there was no impact on the day. The staff were flexible, attentive and (most importantly as two ex-service workers!) everyone seemed to really like being there. We had complex dietary requirements with some guests and these were addressed brilliantly, with these guests getting personalised menus. There were also perfect vegetarian and vegan options. The guests in question went out of their way to thank us for their lovely menu, and none of them were treated any differently.

The biggest thank you to Laura and Abby for planning and managing the day. You were fantastic. An extra shout out to Josephine, who was a delight the whole time we were there and was the friendliest face as I walked over to meet the registrars."
V389,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"Lovely place, just perfect with lovely Barn an pub on the side, accommodation on site was just superb. Laura and Abi made all planing so easy and helped us to have perfect day"
V389,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"I could not recommend the White Hart more as a venue.
Laura and her team were professional and attentive throughout the entire wedding planning process, and will be as involved as you want or need them to be. Nothing is too much trouble for them.

The venue itself is beautiful, in a peaceful country setting, we loved it from our first visit. The mezzanine floor was something I'd never seen before at a venue, and I really felt it added something different and alternative to the venue, plus meant that if the weather took a turn for the worse, (which we were lucky to avoid on our day!) you or your guests won't get wet moving from ceremony to reception!

The bridal preparation suite is also beautiful and spacious enough for all you need in the morning, plus a view out over the front of the Inn where you can see your guests arriving!

Our guests have all commented on how lovely the venue is, as well as the gorgeous accommodation and amazing food. We are looking forward to returning for dinner or even to stay in one of the beautiful rooms.

We highly recommend the White Hart, the service is second to none, and the Wedding package prices are really competitive, we didn't have a huge budget but still managed to afford all we needed and wanted."
V390,The Lawn,"We had a really beautiful wedding day at The Lawn. The experienced team were very helpful with the planning and professional throughout, taking any potential stress out of the day so that we could relax and fully enjoy our special day. Everything went as planned, including the weather allowing us to get married outside in the very pretty gazebo (there was a great back-up plan in case of rain so we didn't have to worry!). Our 60 day guests enjoyed a three course meal which was of great quality; we had many compliments about the food and service, including the evening buffet for 110 guests. The Lawn is a fantastic setting for a wedding, coupled with great service, that we would thoroughly recommend."
V390,The Lawn,"I cannot express the gratitude I have for The Lawn. We had our day on the 25th May 2024 and from start to finish the staff were amazing.

The food was stunning! The venue itself is absolutely breathtaking. Thank you so much for making our day what it was… perfect. I could not recommend this venue enough."
V390,The Lawn,"Where to start? From beginning to end, The Lawn were the perfect venue choice! Not just because of the stunning house and gardens, but because David and the team made every step as stress-free and enjoyable as possible (even with all the questions we kept pinging them). We knew before we visited that The Lawn was the venue for us, to the point we booked then and there! We had absolutely no worries leading up to the day about how things were going to run and throughout the day there was always someone on hand (and with a smile). Honestly, words cannot express how wonderful our day was - utterly perfect! Thank you for everything!"
V390,The Lawn,"We were married in September 2023 and had our reception at the lawn. As it was an African-British wedding, we had many requests which the team at the Lawn really helped with. As we had exclusive use, the bridal party could get dressed at the Lawn before heading to Church and the parking was great for our guests travelling from long distances. Guests loved the horses and grounds. They particularly commented on being well catered for. It was a perfect day!"
V390,The Lawn,"The team at The Lawn helped us to host the perfect wedding. The amount of effort, thought and care that went into supporting us and everything we needed to make the day a success is amazing, this is possibly the first family event we’ve hosted where we have not felt the need to stress over a severe anaphylactic reaction.

From the minute we met we both felt at ease and confident our day would run smoothly, no question or request was too large.
They went above and beyond for us and it was truly appreciated, everyone has commented on the beauty of the venue as well as how smoothly and effortless the day ran.

We would honestly recommend the lawn for anyone looking for a venue to host a celebration - the venue is beautiful and the staff are absolutely amazing."
V390,The Lawn,The best day ever!!! Couldn’t of been any better thank you so much!! All the staff were fab and so so helpful nothing was ever to much hassle. Felt like one big family will be forever grateful!! Love chelsea and sam xx
V390,The Lawn,"Where do I start, we cannot thank you enough for hosting our wedding on Saturday. Your staff were fantastic and the whole day could not have gone any better.
I always knew I wanted to get married at the lawn as my own parents married here 24 years ago, I was 12 years old. 4 years later Matt and I got together and finally after 20 years we had our own special day at the lawn.

Everything from the planning beforehand, adapting the menus so everyone could eat the same including anyone with dietary requirements to how everything kept to schedule.
I was an emotional wreck most of the morning getting ready but you made sure I did not have to worry about anything downstairs and when I finally got to see everything I was blown away.

A special thank you to David, Michael and Lizzie. You are brilliant at what you do.

The caterers and waiting staff were amazing. The food came out all at the same time, was hot and extremely tasty. The staff serving were so kind and accommodating.

This day was long overdue but we were lucky our children got to share it with us like I got to with my parents and you all made it the best day which we will never ever forget. My parents said the high standards you set on Saturday was exactly the same when they got married and it really is the best place to get married so anyone looking for a place to have their wedding and reception book in quick you will not be disappointed.

Thank you again
Jade and Matthew.
Finally Mr & Mrs Judge xxx"
V390,The Lawn,"Wow! What can we say? A perfect day was had at the Lawn, with superb organisation, friendly staff and a beutiful building!"
V390,The Lawn,"We would just like to say a massive thank you for making our twilight
wedding such a magical experience for both of us.

From your patience in answering all our questions leading up to the day to
your almost fanatical weather watching all afternoon (who knew there were so
many apps?! ) and then your ability to switch everything to outside at the
eleventh hour to ensure we could have the service in your beautiful gazebo
just made the perfect start to an amazing evening and the start of our
married life.

Thank you again so much and we send our warmest wishes to you all"
V390,The Lawn,"The whole team did everything to make our day so special. Unfortunately the English weather didn't play ball with us, but it didn't affect the day at all. Everyone was so helpful and the day ran so smoothly. We just wish we could do it all again! Would recommend as a wedding venue!"
V391,Gosfield Hall,"I never imagined my wedding would be somewhere as stunning as Gosfield hall but from the minute we saw this venue we knew it was the one for us and didn't bother viewing anymore venues as we had already made our minds up about having our wedding here! We were absolutely blown away with the natural beauty of Gosfield hall and so booked two years in advance of our wedding day! The professionalism and advice we received from Linda was super helpful and informative on the run up to our wedding as there is soo much to think about! We loved that we could have our day and evening all in one place aswell as the option weather permitting to have our wedding ceremony outside. I'm pleased to say the weather was absolutely perfect on our wedding day and we got to have our fairytale wedding outside! The package we paid for was well worth the money! Our guests were absolutely spoilt on our day and have all said it was the best wedding they've ever been too! It was amazing to have our guests stay over aswell! Jocie our wedding planner was absolutely amazing! She was sooo friendly and super accommodating and went above and beyond on our day to make it absolutely perfect with no hiccups! She even helped dress me on the day as she knew how to do up a corset dress and my mother didn't have a clue lol she made all my wedding details and decorations come to life and done such a stunning job decorating our dream venue aswell as being super supportive towards me my family and guests! The honeymoon suite is the best we've ever seen and completely took ours and our guests breaths away! Mind blowing! The food,venue,grounds,accomodation and night before accomodation were absolutely stunning and we want to thank everyone at Gosfield hall for making our day soo incredible and special and a day we and our guests will never forget! We can't wait to return to Gosfield! Thank you everyone at Gosfield what an amazing place!"
V391,Gosfield Hall,"We had previously experienced Gosfield Hall as a guest before deciding on it for our anniversary.

Our day was beautiful and went according to plan. Our guests all had great feedback about the day.

The only thing we would have changed would have been more diverse menu for the main meals."
V391,Gosfield Hall,"Gosfield hall is a beautiful location for a wedding and their packages cover all the important stuff! We didn’t have to worry about caterers, wedding coordinator or a DJ - all included! Great service, lovely food and everyone really enjoyed the day! Our coordinator Jocie was fab on the day, getting everything organised and fetching anything we needed. Couldn’t have asked for better, she knew the time line and the day flowed really smoothly!"
V391,Gosfield Hall,"We got married at Gosfield Hall and everything about it was perfect from when we arrive to view it, booking, the communication and Faye Carter our wedding Coordinator! If you want the best wedding day with no hassle, Gosfield is your place!!"
V391,Gosfield Hall,"Myself and my Wife have just got married at Gosfield Hall,
Our expensive started when we viewed the venue and we first met Linda sales manager, she welcome us in & made us feel at home, we wasn’t sure how, but she made us feel calm like this was where we was meant to be.
Once we looked around at all the venue has to offer we had already made a decision as this is such a stunning location and instantly new this was what we wanted! It was just right for us.

We did not get made to feel pressured to make any decisions immediately however we did end up booking our big say within the next few days after our visit.

Our next contact was with Ellie our wedding planner, she was very helpful and nothing was ever to much, we enjoyed the food tasting at the venue and was very impressed with the experience, it was out of this world.
Ellie helped us through all of our problems and made sure all of our plans come to life.

Now on our big day, what can I say? The staff were amazing, Ellie couldn’t have done enough every time you wanted to ask a question she was next to us any time we needed something. She was there all the way through the day/ night & even the next morning, Ellie made our day Run seamlessly.
We’ve been to many weddings before but never have we had food as amazing as we did here.
Every guest was amazed at the food quality and commented on how delicious it was!
Just to sum up if you’re thinking about booking your wedding at Gosfield Hall don’t question it just book it. You will be amazed."
V391,Gosfield Hall,"The venue is stunning and was the perfect setting for our winter wedding (so much natural light even in January). Jocie Golbourn was our assigned wedding planning specialist and she is so kind, sweet, patient and professional. All our guests loved the venue but many actually commented on how flawless and seamless the day was organised and rooms decorated and prepared from each section of the wedding and we only have Jocie and venue staff to thank for their meticulous planning and preparations. The food and drinks were delicious. Couldn’t recommend this venue enough- we actually booked the venue on a whim and were SO happy when we visited for an open day. There’s no false advertisements- it’s stunning."
V391,Gosfield Hall,"Everything, from start to finish, was exactly what we wanted and more. The preparation was helped by our wonderful personal manager, Tara, and accommodated each and every one of our requests and needs. The venue is gorgeous, food delicious, and atmosphere felt special. Our friends and family all told us that this was such a spectacular wedding for them that it was the best they've ever been to. We felt completely taken care of, kept us calm and happy throughout the day, and kept all of our suppliers in place and to standard. It felt glamourous and unique. We wish we could relive the day over and over. It really was our dream wedding."
V391,Gosfield Hall,"We got married in Gosfield Hall in May and had the most amazing wedding day that any couple could ask for. The whole experience from the arrival the night before to leaving the day after was seamlessly managed by the team at the venue.
The house and the grounds looked absolutely stunning and Ellie and the team did a brilliant job at keeping the day running smoothly without making anyone feel rushed. Everyone there was immensely friendly and helpful and we really felt that everyone who worked there was invested in making our day feel special.
We fell in love with the venue when we booked it but the whole experience exceeded out expectations so much that we wish we could do it all again!"
V391,Gosfield Hall,"I wanted to take a moment to commend and state our appreciation for Jocie. She truly was phenomenal, approachable and no task was too big.
We had 5 months to plan our wedding and we loved every moment. With us both working in the service industry it was great to have someone who was so switched on and would be an asset to have on any team."
V391,Gosfield Hall,"Having just got married at Gosfield Hall I can honestly say it was the most beautiful venue and the most perfect day. The staff were so attentive and professional. The food was outstanding and the drinks and cocktails were fabulous. They couldn’t do enough to make sure our day was everything we’d dreamt of. I have to say a special thanks to Ellie - one of the wedding coordinators on site - she went above and beyond to help us plan our day and was there from the very moment I woke up delivering fresh pastries for breakfast to the moment she made me a cup of tea to go to bed with. I can’t thank you enough Ellie, you are an absolute credit to Gosfield Hall."
V392,The Georgian Mansion,N/A
V393,Leez Priory,"I never in my life thought I would get married in a place like Leez priory! The whole experience from start to finish was just fantastic. The price breakdown was manageable and there was no pressure to take any upgrades offered. The things we got in our package were phenomenal and having a wedding planner was tremendous - our lady (Leanne) was an absolute god send!
They catered to all our needs and we were made to feel so comfortable and nothing was a problem! I’d highly suggest going to an event there before hand, just to get a feel of what it’s like full of people and enjoy their delicious food. We actually enjoyed their entertainer ( singer) so much we hired him for our wedding ☺️
Lee priory is just so beautiful. I can’t speak highly enough x"
V393,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory on the 7th of September 2024. Considering how long they have been a wedding venue, they were pretty flexible with some of the ideas we had for the venue styling that turned out amazingly!

The staff really made the day something special and couldn't have done enough for us. Special mention must be made for Leanne, our wedding planner, who was amazing!

Highly recommend the venue and the incredible team that helped to make our day so special!"
V393,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in October 2024. This venue is stunning both inside and out with immaculately kept grounds and interior. The hospitality in the lead up to and on the day of the wedding was fantastic. The food was also brilliant. Another great perk of this venue is the amount of on site accommodation.

A couple of drawbacks / experiences during our wedding. There are only a few toilets in the main building which kept blocking and overflowing throughout the evening which led to us taking some guests to the dressing room or honeymoon cottage to use the facilities. You are also restricted by the venue on any external food or drink suppliers and the venues optional extras for this are quite expensive for what they are.

That asaide, we had the best day and evening at Leez Priory and would certainly recommend it!"
V393,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in August 2024- great venue and experience from initial viewing to leaving the morning after the wedding. Leanne acted as our wedding planner and was friendly, professional and helpful throughout. We opted for the classic package and the food was amazing quality with everyone commenting how full they were!
The venue is beautiful with several options for ceremony both inside and out. Accommodation was great too. The whole day ran smoothly with perfect weather - we will have very happy memories of our day!"
V393,Leez Priory,"Perfect venue and very attentive staff, lovely food and great communication from start to finish"
V393,Leez Priory,"Stunning venue. Fantastic Team. Very accommodating toward our unique ""surprise"" strategy. Our guests were truly surprised. Thank you."
V393,Leez Priory,"Leez priory was the 1st and only venue we looked around when we started planning our wedding. From the moment we stepped on the premises, everything just looked so perfect and exactly what we wanted from a wedding venue. When we got assigned our wedding co-ordinator Rachel, she was just absolutely spot on with everything we asked for and nothing was too big an ask for her. She made sure the day ran as smoothly as possible and took care of any issue that arose without me knowing (which I am forever grateful for!!)
The rest of the staff were amazing and very helpful.

The venue itself is just absolutely stunning and we loved that it has the pub area as well as the dance floor so it catered to all of our guests.

All of the rooms were lovely and it was so nice being able to stay in the fisherman’s lodge onsite the night before the wedding.

We genuinely cannot recommend this venue enough and it was 100% worth the money! 10/10!"
V393,Leez Priory,"We got married on a Tuesday in October to maximise the value of what we could get for our money; and honestly, we got everything we wanted and more. Leanne, our Wedding Manager was perfect at bringing an attention to detail and seamless organisation to the big day, and in the lead up. There wasn't one moment of the day where we felt stressed, as Leanne had it covered. In one particular instance, our flowers for the bridal party's hair hadn't arrived. Within five minutes of telling Leanne that we needed this, the flowers were with our hair and make-up suppliers to add the finishing touches.

Leez Priory as a venue is the most stunning setting, and offers an incredible range of areas in which the ceremony and reception can take place. There is also the opportunity for the bridal party to make use of the Fisherman's Cottage the night before the wedding, and for people to stay in the on-site accommodation on the evening of the wedding, making it the perfect venue for people also travelling from further afield.

Leez Priory were very accommodating, welcoming and were happy to work with us to make our day as perfect as possible. The food was incredible, and a total hit with all of our guests, and so many people have commented on how incredible the day was as a whole. You wouldn't be disappointed to choose Leez Priory."
V393,Leez Priory,They catered to our every need. To when we would ask for things they hadn’t been done before they still made sure it went smoothly. Leanne was amazing she made me feel so comfortable from the start. The whole day was stunning. Beautiful venue please go view it as you will not be disappointed
V393,Leez Priory,We got married on the 26 May 2024. This venue was absolutely brilliant! They catered for every need and made sure there was no stress on the day. Leanne was kind and level headed throughout and was always one step ahead! Do not hesitate to book- do it now!
V394,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"Best day of our lives!

The Roslin wedding experience was absolutely flawless from the first meeting we had to the day after our most special wedding day!

Amy and Evan were so supportive and understanding throughout the whole planning experience. They both made us feel so special.

Stefan was exceptional on our wedding day, keeping the day running smoothly and meaning that we could both enjoy the day ourselves without having to worry.

We have had so many people say it was the best wedding they have ever been to. The food was just perfect.

Garry, the DJ was a really nice guy and the dance floor was full all night. Thank you so much Garry!

The bridal suite is absolutely perfect. So many beautiful little touches. The stay was wonderful for all of our guests and the breakfast was outstanding. Even the ladies on the checkout desk made us feel special.

Thank you so much to everyone at the Roslin for making our wedding day so perfect and run so smoothly!

Lots of love,
Mr & Mrs Pope x"
V394,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"Thank you so much for all you have done to make our wedding so perfect.
From the very beginning the team have been communicative and friendly. Very quick replies to emails and quick to answer questions with helpful advice and tips.
On the day the team ensured that everything ran as smoothly as possible. The food was incredible and we have received many compliments regarding the catering team.
The team were both professional and friendly and nothing was too much trouble.
Our stay overnight was in a gorgeous room with a beautiful view.
Breakfast in the morning was delicious.
Thank you again."
V394,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"Well, Amy and the team - what can we say?? Our day was absolute perfection. Here are some things we would like to comment on to demonstrate just how amazing the day was:
Ceremony - complete attention to detail - we were not going to have a signing table as we had legally married the day before - Amy was honest and said the room would look bare and she was absolutely right - so glad we decided to listen to Amy's advice. The room was decorated stunningly - there was such attention to detail - extras of our flowers were placed tastefully in vases around the room, there were lanterns and candles that we had not asked for but made the room look more finished. There were extra centre pieces we had provided - these were placed in different areas to compliment the theme.
Bridal party arrival - upon arrival there was a complimentary bottle of prosecco for the party in the bridal suite. The suite was beautiful and our bouquets were laid out so nicely for us. We asked for some more champagne flutes and straight away, within 2 mins there were some at our door.
En route to the ceremony I was worried about the song and when everyone had to walk in - why I was worried I do not know as Amy had listened to it numerous times and knew exactly when to send everyone in. Amy and Evan even sorted out my dress so it looked beautiful walking down the aisle.
Throughout the ceremony the team had tidied the bridal suite room and put chocolates and petals on the bed. When I went to show my husband the suite, I had warned him that it had been a bit of a mess - but no - Amy and the team had ensured it looked almost as if noone had been there!
Drinks reception - we went for photos on the beach and whilst this was happening there was canapes and prosecco - at previous weddings people had commented that they (as bride and groom) had not had the opportunity to try their canapes as they had been doing photos - but the team had thought of this and Tate brought us out our own little plate with 2 of each canapes each.
The change over was swift and the room looked fabulous for dinner thanks for Evan and her guidance - Amy had suggested having a smaller number of tables and more people on each otherwise the tables would look bare - again absolutely the right decision. We had some elderly guests and while the change over was happening they were given chairs to sit on which was no drama whatsoever for the staff.
The meal - everyone raved about the food - it was sublime - presented so tastefully and portions were generous. It was a really lovely touch that Tate went around and asked every single table, not just the top table, how their food was. This was great as I have never seen this at a wedding before.
Again, turnaround for the evening was flawless and the ballroom looked beautiful.
Other things that made our day extra special - everyone who was part of the wedding party received room upgrades free of charge which really made everyone feel special; we didnt have time to try our cake, but the team had realised this would be the case and on arrival to the bridal suite after the evening there was two slices of cake presented beautifully with some of the left over flowers, as well as our gifts and cards and the left over drinks from dinner service. Nothing went to waste as the bottles of wine that were not used at dinner were left on the bar for guests to enjoy in the evening too.
We cannot fault the service or staff at the Roslin at all.
A few special mentions -
Nicky behind the bar - you are a wonderful woman and made sure nothing was too much - you made drinks with love and were a real hit with the guests, everyone said how wonderful you were. Thank you for being great.
Tate - wow - you were so calm and collected - if we wanted 5 mins to ourselves that was not an issue - nothing was too much to ask. You ensured the day ran smoothly (we were always on time throughout the day) and you ensured that everyone was well looked after. Thank you - you are fantastic at your job.
Evan - You ensured the turn around of the room was done quickly but with class and flawlessly finished. Thank you.
Amy - what can we say - your team are an absolute credit to you, and it is because of you that we had a wedding that was more than we ever could have dreamed of. Your operations runs like a well-oiled machine but at the same time ensures the authenticity and personalism of every single wedding, to ensure it retains it individuality. Some weddings have felt like 'conveyer belts' but every single person spoke so highly of you, the team and the venue. Thank you endlessly for your love and dedication to what you do. It is very evident.
One small thing - oh... who are we kidding! The day was the most perfect experience. We will treasure The Roslin and our treatment as bride and groom forever. You are wonderful people, great value for money as a venue and you will always hold a special place in our heart. Thank you. Mr and Mrs Lee"
V394,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"Where to begin…. If anyone is thinking of having a wedding here, DO IT! The most stress free and lovable venue we could have asked for, Special thanks to Evan and Amy were incredible leading up to and on the day! The venue is stunning, the food was sooo goood, and the staff were fantastic!
Magical!!
Many Thanks, Nathan!"
V394,The Roslin Beach Hotel,Brilliantly done. Being so busy I wanted a venue that would just get it done. They did that and did it perfectly!!! Everyone commented on the brilliance of the Roslin!
V394,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"Thank you for all your hard work to make our day extra special and run so smoothly. We were both so relaxed the whole day, enjoying every moment. Amy is truly amazing at her job and just get 'it', she saw our vision and made it come to life. People complimented on the day and the Roslin team are at the top of their game."
V394,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"A very big heartfelt thank you for all your help and guidance, assistance and planning on our wedding day along with the lead up to it.

A special mention goes to our events manager Amy, you were a godsend from start to finish, thank you so much for your perfect organisation skills and helping run the wedding morning so calmly. Zed & Tate - thank you for all of your help and co-ordination during our wedding, evening and Sunday celebrations.

You all made our day perfect and complete, we could not have imagined holding our special day anywhere else."
V394,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"We can’t thank Roslin Beach Hotel enough for all of their help, everything went so smoothly and Amy helped us all to stay so calm!! We had such an amazing day and all of the members of staff could not do enough for all of us , the service was impeccable!! Couldn’t have asked for a better venue , the food was amazing and We were treated so well. Thanks again for all of your kindness , Amy and her team really made our day PERFECT !!"
V394,The Roslin Beach Hotel,Thank you so much to all management and staff for making my daughter and son-in-law's wedding day so special on 1st June. All your hard work and dedication showed through on the day. Thank you once again!
V394,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"We would like to say a big thank you to you and all the Roslin staff for making Ruth & Kelly's Wedding such a wonderful memorable day. Attention to detail was first class. DJ, flowers, the food, the waiting staff, in fact, the whole package couldn't have been better. Our guests were full of praise for this exceptional venue."
V395,Wivenhoe House,"we had a summer wedding July 2022. we had a garden ceremony.

from the day of enquiry to the day of the wedding, the team were fantastic, nothing was a problem, they were so willing to arrange, or sort out everytging.
We originally booked during covid but dates were moved due to health reasons, the team were more than happy to assist
they are great for advice and guidance for recommendations of suppliers that are loyal to them and reasonably priced also.

they were especially kind to my father who is in a wheelchair paralysed, Lionel one of the management team made sure a member of staff was always on hand helping him, to make the day as stress free for both of my parents, from the day before when they arrived to the moment they left with their luggage.
Lionel also organised the party of 20+ guests (including children) staying the night before the wedding the marquee for us all to have our evening meal together next to the restaurant, which was so kind.

the groom and i got ready separately in different areas of the hotel. i had a bridal team of 10 as did he, the wivenhoe team, were there continuously helping assisting and asking if we needed anything,

i had a particular set up of my décor for my tables, sweet cart etc, and lisa the events manager knew exactly my style and had it done perfectly. she was there early before she was expected helping and organising going above and beyond what she was needed to do, to make our day perfect.

the food was amazing, we had cocktails, canapes, wedding breakfast and the evening buffet, everyone was impressed with the high standard of food and service. (especially the guests who had special dietary requirements, who were very well looked after and felt like VIP’s)

lisa was a rock to us she was always there wherever i needed her, and she made our day flawless and perfect!

the reception team, were a great help, we had 20 rooms booked in the end, and i was constantly emailing for adding more and having a spreadsheet of who has booked etc.

the management team and the staff are wonderful
if we could afford it we would do it all over again a heartbeat! Was the happiest day of our lives, never stopped smiling or laughing x"
V395,Wivenhoe House,"From the initial meeting through to the day of our wedding Louise and Phoebe were excellent.
Nothing was too much trouble.
In the day of the wedding they dressed the venue to the highest standard and were so attentive, even helping my daughter when her speech became so emotional.
I cannot rate them high enough.
Stunning venue with the highest level of service.
Price was reasonable with so many extras included saving the stress of sorting discos and catering.
1000% the best choice we made.
Thank you Wivenhoe house for making our dream wedding come true."
V395,Wivenhoe House,"The Wivenhoe House Hotel, Colchester.
The whole experience from beginning to end was faultless.
Perfect day."
V395,Wivenhoe House,"Our wedding at wivenhoe house was everything we dreamed of!. The setting is beautiful and our wedding coordinator lisa, was just perfect. Price was very reasonable too! Amazing food and service :)"
V395,Wivenhoe House,"The wedding couldn’t have gone anymore amazing thanks to the team at Wivenhoe house. We was meant to get married in 2020, then 2021 and finally managed 2022. This was with massive support from the team also. The day went so amazing as they all went above and beyond for us."
V395,Wivenhoe House,"We got married nearly a year ago now 1/11/2019.
Wivenhoe house is truest beautiful and it I feel should be higher on people’s list for a wedding venue. The house is beautiful and I loved my wedding day. Katie was perfect as a planner and listened to us completely even my husbands idea of llamas!! Which we didn’t follow through with. The price was amazing for what we got included!!
The food was so great!! Especially the pudding and the evening buffet was the best I’d seen for the amount and selection. Would highly recommend the sliders. Overall I would give 10/10."
V395,Wivenhoe House,"I enjoyed most of it my wedding coordinator done well as well with all staff, room are clean decoration was lovely ,stunning areas ,food for my wedding breakfast is delicious all our guest ? love it ,we look after properly I highly recommend Wivenhoe house for wedding ."
V395,Wivenhoe House,Thank you so much for all your help in arranging our beautiful wedding reception. Everybody loved the day and we’re very impressed with your staff. They were attentive and approachable. We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Wivenhoe House to friends and family. We couldn’t be happier. The food was beautiful. We wish you all the best and thank you for all your patience. Hope to see you all again in the future.
V395,Wivenhoe House,"My husband and I got married here on the 30th June. We honestly couldn't have picked a better venue. We first visited this venue on a wedding open evening that they had, and it was incredibly busy. Yet, there was a member of staff on hand that could help and attend any questions/queries that we had. I'd spent a year planning our wedding, mainly with Katie Ballard. Her help and knowledge of wedding planning really was second to none. I'd never planned a wedding before so all of her help and guidance was very much appreciated. I had many visits to WHH throughout the year and each member of staff honestly couldn't do more for you. We did a menu tasting for our wedding day and was assisted by Ellie in the Brasserie. Her knowledge on all of the food options available was very impressive. The food was outstanding, we had 3 courses and 4 different dishes and each one was cooked and served to perfection. It's safe to say that Our wedding day was more than I could ever had imagined. It truly was perfect in every way and ran incredibly smoothly. Our guests also found the staff to be incredibly helpful and attentive, as they were helped with luggage, and allowing a few guests into their rooms a little earlier. I honestly couldn't recommend this venue enough. The house and grounds are breathtaking. And the staff are truly what make it the most wonderful, memorable experience."
V395,Wivenhoe House,"We booked Wivenhoe house bout a year before the wedding, we had amazing service from start to finish! Louise was responsive to all emails and incredibly helpful in sorting out all of the final details.

The day ran incredibly smoothly, all of the staff were fantastic."
V396,Stock Brook Country Club,We fell in love when we saw the venue for the very first time. It's beautiful and you can really go to town with decorations or keep it as simple as you like. The venue looked even better than I had pictured on my wedding day. We got so many compliments about the canapés and food at the wedding day as well. The only disappointing thing I found was that we couldn't access the bridal suite to get ready until 11am which is in the courtyard and where you can get amazing pictures. We had to start getting ready in a hotel nearby and then move there which was extremely stressful I begged Stock Brook to provide us with another room or access from 10 as that would've worked for us but they wasn't helpful at all if I'm honest. It's something I never really thought of until you are arranging timings for hair and make up etc and most people can access their prep room a lot earlier but the rest of the day made up for this and I really did have the best day.
V396,Stock Brook Country Club,"This venue was everything we had ever dreamed of and more. The venue is stunning and the space perfect. We got married in the rosewood suite which is a lovely long aisle to walk down, had the reception drinks in the gardens which was stunning and perfect for a hot sunny day. Our evening was upstairs in the ballroom and this was the whole reason we chose this venue. The space is perfect and the dance floor and glitter ball is so pretty. With the help of our venue decorator this room was breathtaking.

From start to finish our wedding co ordinator was on hand to answer any questions we had and helped us to ensure our day was perfect."
V396,Stock Brook Country Club,My husband and I booked our wedding with Stock Brook Manor in early 2019. I want to mention Joe who was our planner and contact at Stock Brook. He helped us plan a big wedding and then COVID happened. Joe helped us plan a smaller wedding and genuinely his help was invaluable. We are so thankful to Joe for working with us to make our day perfect. I would recommend Stock Brook Manor. Beautiful venue and amazing service from Joe and the other staff who work hard and are so friendly.
V396,Stock Brook Country Club,"We had the most fabulous day, Stock Brook is the best and most perfect wedding venue in the area. The venue speaks for itself and the food, service and wedding planning support are as brilliant. As a PA who is usually the bossy organiser, it was apparent from the outset that the team there have everything running perfectly so I felt more than happy taking a step back and concentrate on other areas of the wedding. I cannot thank the team including firstly Joe and then in the main Eleanor for everything they did. I couldn’t have dreamed of a better day."
V396,Stock Brook Country Club,"My husband and I got married at Stockbrook at the weekend, and had an absolutely fantastic day. All the staff from the cleaners to the waiting and bar staff were fantastic and work so hard to make it a perfect day. A particular mention to Joe Howgate who ensured everything on the day was perfect (which is no easy task with me being such a perfectionist). The food was amazing, and we had several comments that it was the best food people had tasted at a wedding. Overall, it was a fantastic day, thank you to all the staff, you’re AMAZING!! We will never forget our wonderful day!"
V396,Stock Brook Country Club,"From start to finish, everyone was great. Eleanor Pitts was our event planner, she went above and beyond at every opportunity. She helped us with the finer details that I wouldn't have even thought of. Venue was stunning, I wasn't aware of any faults, if there was any, we didn't have a clue. Eleanor helped make the day perfect, thank you sooo much."
V396,Stock Brook Country Club,"On our initial visit to Stockbrook Manor we instantly fell I love with the venue.
Joe, our coordinator was amazing throughout from when we had our initial planning meeting all the way to our final meeting. He was extremely thorough, patient & organised which really put our minds at ease.
Brides please bear with Joe as there were some periods of radio silence towards the wedding but this was due to the fact that Joe had a large number of weddings to coordinate. On our wedding day Joe was amazing, he knew our day like the back of his hand which really made the day perfect.
All our guests haven't stopped commenting on our wedding day, from the canapes to drinks, to the food and evening food! Guests who stayed at great blunts and the stables loved the accommodation. Thanks to all the staff at Stockbrook and especially Joe who we feel blessed to have as our coordinator.

From

The Frasers"
V396,Stock Brook Country Club,"It's versatility, the size, the use of both outdoor and indoor space and the decor (of both the venue plus the stunning Great Blunts House accommodation). We were also really impressed with the added extras that were included in the wedding package. We also really appreciated how flexible and open minded you were with our ideas with regards to themes and how we wanted the set up. The operation of the day couldn't have gone any better. You delivered everything we had planned and you didn't let me down in any aspect. One of my aunties was so happy with the quality of the food she wanted to thank the chef in person. Best wishes to you and all the fantastic team at Stock Brook."
V396,Stock Brook Country Club,"A massive thank you to all staff at Stock Brook Country Club for helping us bring our magical wedding day together! In particular Eleanor who has helped guide and accomodate us with all our planning and making our journey a smooth one! The venue itself is beautiful and spacious and looked elegant on the day thanks to Sophie, and her beautiful decorations. The guests enjoyed the food, drink and in particular spoke very highly of the stables accommodation we stayed at. We could not have asked for more and very pleased x"
V396,Stock Brook Country Club,"We would just like to say a massive thank you. From the minute we met you, we knew you had got this! From the bottom of our hearts it was truly the best day of our lives! All our guests haven't stopped commenting on our wedding day, from the canapes to drinks, to the food and evening food! Our guests said it's the best wedding food they have ever had. You made sure everthing was perfect for us. We can't thank you enough."
V397,Vaulty Manor,"Beautiful venue, lovely staff! Thank you for a wonderful day.

V397,Vaulty Manor,"Beautiful day, thank you to the whole team for everything. Stunning venue and the staff were amazing. Everything ran smoothly and the whole wedding was better than we could have ever dreamt of. Thanks a million, it was a great day that we will remember for the rest of our lives."

V398,Hutton Hall,"I just wanted to express my deepest gratitude to you both, and your amazing team of staff. From the day we booked, to enjoying breakfast the morning after the wedding, you have spoiled us with such a personal level of service. I honestly felt as if our wedding day was a luxury house party. It felt so intimate from start to finish. I've often said that, you wouldn't be greeted with the same level of personable service at a large cooperate venue. This is what made our wedding day so very special.
A special mention to the incredible Ray, who ensured our wedding day went smoothly, as well as keeping on top of the beautiful roaring fires! Also, a special mention to Marion, who ended up driving me and my Mum to the church when the rain scuppered my country walk plans. All our very dear friends and family, have complimented us on such a beautiful venue choice, and how it is possibly the best wedding they've ever been to.
So, thank you once again for all you did. May we wander the country lane for weekends to come, dreaming of our very special wedding day at Hutton Hall."
V398,Hutton Hall,"From the moment we first stepped foot into Hutton Hall we knew it was our dream venue! We truly had the wedding of our dreams.
From staying the night before, to getting ready in the morning, to dancing the wedding night away, every part of the day was perfect. We could not have wished for anything more!"
V398,Hutton Hall,"My husband and I had the most perfect wedding day at Hutton Hall. The owner, Paola, offers brilliant wedding packages and the catering outsourced to Limeberry, was outstanding. The bridal suite and guest bedrooms are luxurious and comfortable. The grounds are outstanding and brilliant for photographs. I couldn't recommend this venue more!"
V398,Hutton Hall,"Words cannot describe how beautiful Hutton Hall is.

As soon as we pulled through the gates we knew this venue was for us. We had already seen a few venues and this on made us go WOW!

Every single room in Hutton Hall was stunning!

Paola and Francesca were so lovely and we were so grateful to get to know them and their family.

We felt so at ease at the venue and had the most lovely overnight stay and breakfast as well.

I am hoping I can stay again in the future to remember the great memories of our wedding.

A magnificent venue, would highly recommend.

Mr and Mrs Hernaman xx"
V398,Hutton Hall,"Hutton Hall had everything we were looking for from a venue its stunning and has the wow factor plus for me with the beautiful village church based just at the back of the grounds, over the little wooden bridge it couldn't have been more perfect for a church wedding and then reception location!
We hired the bridal suite and bedrooms the night before the wedding so we had access to the light, bright and lovely preparation room for myself, mum and bridesmaids to get ready with an early start on the day.

The marquee set up for the wedding breakfast was beautiful overlooking the grounds and the fountains and with the sides up as it was a nice day was just perfect.

I was initially a little worried about the space as we had 100 guests in the day time, and 30+ in the evening, but I shouldn't have been concerned as it worked brilliantly and never felt overcrowded. The dancefloor even though it's a separate room was constantly busy all night and the courtyard and main hall and bars were perfect for people to mingle!

We had so many compliments from friends and family about what a great venue and day it was and we were honestly thrilled.

The Georgian Manor house with its high ceilings and beautiful features was ideal as we wanted light and airy, with a feeling of glamour / grandeur. I have to say it had all this, while also feeling intimate.
We fell in love with Hutton Hall straight away, and booked very quickly after our first viewing. Francesca and Paula are brilliant and answered all my many questions and worked with us to coordinate the day. They also work with a great selection of their tried and tested suppliers who are not only nice people but deliver a top class service.

I cannot recommend Hutton Hall enough, and if you have any doubts over the suppliers included in the packages, we can confirm Limeberry catering provided a slick service the food was delicious, hot and well presented with a lovely team of waiting staff and DJ AJ (Paul G) was fantastic keeping the dancefloor busy all night too. They have such a great team on board here, which makes life so much easier as a bride, if I'd have known how great it was going to be, i wouldn't have wasted less time worrying about the little things!

Thank you so much for the best day of our lives.

V398,Hutton Hall,We had the best day at Hutton Hall. The building and grounds are beautiful and all of the staff are lovely! Paola helped us organise everything and answered all of our questions promptly. She supported us throughout the delays due to covid and was very understanding. We had the most magical day and Hutton Hall made it run smoothly and stress free! Definitely recommend.
V398,Hutton Hall,"Seamless day in the most beautiful venue. From the moment I viewed Hutton Halls website i knew it would be our venue. The whole building is stunning - from the blue room to the bridal prep room to the grounds.

It is run by the two loveliest ladies - Paola and Francesca who are always on hand to answer (my many!) questions.

The evening before myself and my bridesmaids stayed at the venue which I recommend doing as it made the build up so special. Paola bought us a nice cold bottle of Prosecco up and a lovely cup of tea for me (my favourite!). We ordered in food and had a really relaxed luxurious night in their beautiful bedrooms - the huge bridal suite bath is a must!

The day of the wedding was seamless. Everyone who came said it was the most beautiful venue they’d been to. The entrance hall when you walk in is breathtaking and there are many silk flower arrangements around helping the decor of the day look extra stunning.

The food on the day was spectacular. We used Limeberry who are a preferred supplier of the venue and I’m extremely fussy on food but wow - they really blew us away! The food was plentiful (nothing worse than being hungry at a wedding but no chance here!) and Angie who ran the catering side was super helpful and made sure we had everything we needed. The dishes were made gluten free with no issue and were delicious.

Our day was just everything we had dreamed of and more - the photos are breathtaking. I can’t thank Paola enough for pulling together the day of my dreams and being so friendly and helpful along the way.

If you’re thinking of holding your wedding here it’ll be the best choice you’ve made. It was a fairytale day"
V398,Hutton Hall,Paola was a great host when showing me and my fiance around the venue. I can't wait to visit here again and get married here next year! Thanks
V398,Hutton Hall,"Hutton Hall was everything we were looking for in our venue, and did not disappoint on the day. It was absolutely stunning, offering we wanted very conveniently located next to each other: huge and luxurious bridal suite and guest rooms, outside ceremony area, beautiful gardens for champagne reception and garden games, stunning marquee for the dinner, spacious areas inside for dancing, seating areas and two bars, and beautiful fairy light courtyard for our evening pizza. The team behind Hutton Hall are what make this venue truly ideal though. We felt supported and in very safe hands throughout the planning process and on the day, and truly felt like the whole team genuinely wanted our day to run perfectly...and it really did! You won't be disappointed!"
V398,Hutton Hall,"The bridal party arrived just after 10 o’clock to be greeted with a lovely smile and hug from Paola. We were left to get on with our preparations. But someone was on hand to help if needed.
What a fantastic venue. Lovely people. Fabulous grounds. We didn’t want to leave. Thank You to everyone at Hutton Hall for a great day."
V399,Smeetham Hall Barn,"If you are looking for a romantic barn setting Smeetham hall barn is the one…we can not thank Sophie and the team at Smeetham hall for being nothing but incredible through the whole process of planning our wedding and to the most amazing day we could have ever wished for…what we would give to relive the day all over again

Thank you once again for being so amazing

Mr & Mrs Field (Lucy & Rob) 05.04.25 X"
V399,Smeetham Hall Barn,"We first found came across Smeetham Hall Barn 7 years ago. After looking at other venues we kept being drawn back here. The venue and grounds are absoutely stunning. Sophie has been amazing from the very beginning, nothing was too much trouble even arranging for my nan to come along in her wheelchair which meant so much to us. Our day could not have gone any smoother. Our wedding breakfast was fantastic, a lot of guests complimented the food and the service from Splinters Caterers. We could not have asked for a more perfect wedding day!"
V399,Smeetham Hall Barn,"We fell in love with Smeetham Hall Barn from the moment we pulled up in the car. The venue is absolutely beautiful. Sophie was fantastic, from the very first email to arrange a viewing, right up to the big day. She took the stress out of planning our wedding and allowed us to simply enjoy the process. Nothing was ever too much trouble, and emails were replied to within the day. Our wedding day was the best day, and this is thanks to
Sophie and the team at the beautiful Smeetham Hall Barn. The only downside was that the wedding flew by so quickly; we wish we could relive it all over again."
V399,Smeetham Hall Barn,"Smeetham Hall Barn was the perfect venue for us. It was the only venue we viewed and an easy decision - it had everything we were looking for. It certainly lived up to our hopes and dreams. The barn and setting are naturally beautiful, without requiring loads of additional decoration. Their twinkly fairy lights set the scene perfectly. Having so many scenic spots for a variety of photograph opportunities is ideal. Our experience from booking to our big day was seamless. We were always kept informed and knew we’d hear back quickly if we had any queries. Sophie helped so much behind the scenes to ensure everything went to plan, she consistently eased any neves and went above and beyond for us. Splinters the caterers who are included within our wedding package were brilliant. The wedding breakfast was delicious and all our guests were very complimentary. Thank you to all at Smeetham Hall Barn and Splinters for being part of our perfect day. We loved every second and will forever hold the fondest memories 🤍"
V399,Smeetham Hall Barn,"Sophie and Victoria were absolutely brilliant in the lead up to our wedding, they were always ready to answer my many many questions 😂 They were so organised and made the day run perfectly. Tom behind the bar was brilliant too.
We’ve had so many compliments on how beautiful the venue was and how amazing the day was. We are both so grateful to the whole team at Smeetham Hall for everything they did for our perfect day. Would highly recommend!!"
V399,Smeetham Hall Barn,"Smeetham is such a perfect place to get married. The team supported us every step of the way, even when we were asking so many questions, and they were always so happy to help. Everyone is so kind and they understood our vision for the day. Everything went so perfectly and I couldn’t have ask for a better day! Thank you so so much!"
V399,Smeetham Hall Barn,"They say it’s the people who make your wedding, and that couldn't be more true. We were not only surrounded by family and friends but also by a team who truly felt like part of our celebration. A huge thank you to the entire Smeetham Hall Barn team, but with a special mention to Bridget, who welcomed us so warmly on our first visit that Smeetham instantly felt like home, and left us with no question that this was the venue for us. And to Sophie, thank you for all of your support throughout our planning journey, for always being just an email away with answers to our questions, for welcoming us at open days, and for being such a friendly presence on both our setup and wedding day whilst making sure everything went smoothly - we couldn’t have asked for more.

Smeetham Hall Barn itself provided the perfect setting for our autumnal wedding. Having worked in events ourselves, we were eager to find a venue with authentic charm, not a corporate feel. After viewing several other ‘barns,’ we started to wonder if we’d have to compromise, but Smeetham exceeded our hopes - it was everything we’d been searching for and more. With its unique, rustic character and all the amenities needed for a perfect wedding day, Smeetham Hall Barn truly stands out, and we feel very lucky to have stumbled across such a beautiful venue, less than half an hour from home. We were given complete flexibility to customise the space to suit our theme and add personal touches, with helpful recommendations for suppliers along the way. Having a full day to set up allowed us to truly enjoy the experience, extending our celebrations and ensuring everything looked just as we’d envisioned, without the stress or time pressures - a rarity in the wedding industry.

Looking back, our only wish is that we could do it all over again - it was truly the perfect day. We couldn’t recommend Smeetham Hall Barn more highly to anyone searching for their wedding venue."
V399,Smeetham Hall Barn,"Picking a venue is just….woah. It’s a LOT. Except when it’s not, because you’re made to feel like centre stage from the outset. We’d viewed a few venues which were starting to blur into one and a feeling a bit overwhelmed with it all. So if it’s the people that make a wedding, you can definitely include the Smeetham Hall team with that.
From the open evening, to booking and run through to the event (and MANY emails in between) they were only too happy to help. And encourage some out of the box fun with it.
SO many positive vibes from our guests about the venue itself from the ceremony on the lawn, the outdoor drinks reception and the barn itself for the wedding breakfast. Each element creating it’s own little piece of the day.
Great vendor partners on hand too to make sorting details like the food, DJ, lighting etc a breeze.
Thank you Sophie and Victoria.
James and Laressa Human"
V399,Smeetham Hall Barn,"WOW…where do we start! Firstly, we planned our wedding from Australia and from our initial video call with Bridget we knew there was something very special about Smeetham Hall Barn and we were in safe hands. Sophie - you were amazing, quickly getting back to my questions over the year and ensuring everything ran smoothly on the day. Tom went above and beyond for the evening bar, honouring a special request we had for an evening drink - so incredible! The whole process was seamless and we couldn’t be anymore grateful to everyone at Smeetham Hall Barn for making ensuring we had the best day of our lives, which we truly did! Cannot recommend SHB enough - thank you everyone, we want to do it all over again ! ♥️"
V399,Smeetham Hall Barn,"Our wedding at Smeetham Hall Barn on 10th June 2024 was absolutely perfect! The venue’s elegant charm and stunning grounds provided a beautiful backdrop for our special day.

The staff were exceptional, handling every detail with professionalism and care, allowing us to truly enjoy our celebration.

Smeetham Hall Barn offered the perfect mix of beauty, excellent service, and a warm ambiance. We couldn’t have asked for a better place to celebrate our wedding and highly recommend it to any couple looking for an unforgettable venue."
V400,Hedsor House,"After getting engaged on July 1st, 2023, I used Hitched to find local wedding venues and discovered Hedsor. From the moment we found Hedsor, we knew no other venue could compare (even without visiting in person).

We arranged a virtual tour with Kate and instantly felt a connection. She was professional, knowledgeable, and friendly, making us feel confident that we were in very safe hands. Although we initially planned to marry in 2025 due to other commitments in 2024, we found a rare opportunity to get married at Hedsor on December 29th, 2023. What started as a hypothetical possibility quickly became reality after talking with Kate and Hedsor's preferred suppliers. We decided to take the plunge (yes, we are mad!).

Since Hedsor's packages were unavailable during the Christmas break, we opted to dry-hire the house and worked with a mix of preferred and self-sourced suppliers. Organising everything in just four months was crazy, but Kate was always there to support and guide us through the process. We truly could not have done it without her and the wider Hedsor team!

As for the wedding day itself—just WOW. It was perfect from start to finish, exceeding our very high expectations. The house was beautifully decorated for Christmas, adding an extra touch to this already stunning and special place. Trish and the team ran the day like a military operation, allowing my husband and me to fully relax and savour every moment.

Thank you to everyone at Hedsor for making our wedding day the best day of our lives. It turned out to be even more than our dream day!"
V400,Hedsor House,My dream wedding in our dream venue. From start to finish Hedsor house was everything I dreamt of and more. The staff were amazing and they made our day stress free!
V400,Hedsor House,"Hedsor House.... Why wouldn't you choose Hedsor!? From the get go Hedsor ticked all of our boxes for the show-stopper Wedding we imagined. The bonus is that you have exclusive use of the mansion & we opted to dry hire the day before our wedding and had a pre-wedding celebration with guests staying in the house - it was amazing!

For our wedding day we chose the 1776 package and all the suppliers included were phenomenal, we also used suppliers from the preferred supplier list who were all great too.

The team at Hedsor are just brilliant, we cannot thank them enough for their quick responses and never saying no to all of the ideas we had.

Thank you Hedsor for the Wedding of our dreams, Stefan & Katie xx"
V400,Hedsor House,"Best wedding venue I have ever found, and I’ve been looking for a very, very long time! (Long engagement). Their packages are phenomenal value for money for what’s on the market, their open days are like a dream (honestly), and their customer service is absolutely excellent. I have been in talks with Hedsor on and off for a number of years as we opted for a long engagement and wanted to save for this incredible venue. They have been incredible the whole time, have never pressured us to book, and always been so accommodating and patient with our questions over the last few years. They have supported us every step of the way in such a non-pushy way, and we have now finally secured our wedding date with them and I couldn’t be happier. The packages take care of almost everything, taking the pressure and stress out of organising numerous different vendors (flowers, cake, food, decorations, RJ etc) there is almost nothing not covered or catered for within their wedding packages.

I honestly have not one bad word to say about Hedsor and the team. Having been in communication with them for such a long time, I can say they are consistent, reliable and lovely to work with - 10/10 for everything so far!"
V400,Hedsor House,"We recently had our amazing wedding at Hedsor House and did one of their signature packages the ‘1776’ package. We honestly had the best day ever and our only complaint was it went too fast!!
All the Hedsor team were absolutely brilliant and couldn’t do enough for us!
We’ve had so many lovely compliments from our guests on the stunning house as well as how smoothly the day ran and a lot of our guests have said it was the best wedding they have ever been too!
We would thoroughly recommend Hedsor House to anyone looking for a wedding venue and once you set eyes on the stunning house you’ll see exactly why!
But not only is it an absolutely beautiful venue but all of the staff are so warm and welcoming too making it the perfect venue!
I wish we could do it all over again!!!"
V400,Hedsor House,"We simply cannot fault anything to do with our Wedding at Hedsor. Our wedding was initially booked for December 2020, and had to make the decision to postpone to December 2021. Jennie and the Team could not have been more supportive. In the run up to the day, Jennie was on hand for all of my questions no matter how big or small.
When the day finally came, all of the staff were excellent. A massive shoutout to Matt who made everything simply flawless. I didn't have to lift a finger.
For a truly special wedding venue, Hedsor will never disappoint."
V400,Hedsor House,"Dream wedding venue with the best staff. Stayed here for two nights, and couldn’t be more pleased. We adore everyone at Hedsor house. Thank you for making our experience a memorable one. We love you guys!"
V400,Hedsor House,"Dear Jennie and the Hedsor staff,

There are truly no words to describe how thankful we are for you all. Our wedding day was perfect and that’s all thanks to you.
Jennie, thank you for always listening to our wants for our day and your speedy response times. It always made planning from across the pond so much easier.
I never had any doubts about how smoothly our wedding day would go because I knew I was in good hands.
On the day of everyone commented on how helpful the whole staff was. All of our guests were blown away by literally everything about Hedsor.
I will forever recommend Hedsor and your team. I wish we could relive the day basically every day, Hedsor is the most magical place.
Thank you so much for making our day so magical.
Any couple getting married is so lucky they have incredible people like you making sure their day is perfect.
We hope you all had a Merry Christmas and a wonderful start to the New Year!
Much love,
Mara & Patrick
PS. Thank you for the beautiful cutting board and bottles of champagne. We get lots of compliments on the beautiful cutting board!"
V400,Hedsor House,"Hi Jennie, Katie and the Hedsor team,

Thank you so so much for everything you’ve done for us. We cannot thank you enough and also really appreciate your patience with us when going through the visa and rooming process. My mother and father in law were able to be there after flying in literally the night before and we could not have asked for a more perfect day.

Everyone absolutely loved the venue and we received so many compliments.

All the house managers were absolutely brilliant and just wanted to say a special thank you to Vic who walked me down from my bridal room and gave me some fantastic calming words of advice before I made my entrance. He was absolutely lovely and cannot thank the team enough for everything on the day and on the morning after.

The official pictures haven’t been released yet however I thought I would send you some casual ones from the day. I will of course send you them when they come out.

Thank you again and we hope you had a lovely Christmas and New Year break!

Very best,
Aiysha and Rehan"
V400,Hedsor House,"Dear Natasha & the wonderful Hedsor team,

Thank you so much for all you did to help make our special day truly unforgettable.

Since the first day we visited, we knew Hedsor House would make the most stunning venue and the house and gorgeous views took our guests breath away. It will forever hold the most incredible memories of our most perfect wedding day.
We are so grateful for all your guidance, assistance and professionalism leading up to the day. We felt we were in the best hands every step of the way and it was always such a joy to read your kind and thoughtful emails.
We are only sad that the fun of the wedding planning with you is over and want to do it all again. We will cherish Hedsor House forever and we cannot wait to be able to visit again soon.
Thank you again!

Lots of love,
Alice & David xxx"
V401,That Amazing Place,"We held a small family wedding (about 40 people) here and 'wow' the place and the team, particularly Angie, certainly were 'amazing'! The main house is beautiful and quirky and set in beautiful grounds, whilst the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. It was spotlessly clean and felt very exclusive with it being sited away from neighbouring properties. We felt the setting was idyllic for our wedding and would certainly recommend it to others."
V401,That Amazing Place,"We got married at That Amazing Place on 9/11/24
What can i say! 100% have your wedding here, you will not be disappointed. From first meeting Angie and the team in 2023, all the way through they were fantastic. We stayed in the beautiful cottage the night before. Our wedding morning, service, meal, evening everything was perfect.
Nothing was to much trouble, Angie and the team
Styled the venue perfectly, following my exact instructions and more. Words can not express how grateful we are for such a fantastic support team.
The venue is beautiful, it truly has its own personality. Every single guest commented the same.
Thank you so much Angie, Louise and team. You made our wedding exactly how we had dreamed xx"
V401,That Amazing Place,We got married at That Amazing Place in august 2024 and what an AMAZING place it is. The staff were all so friendly and An extra big thankyou to Angie and Louise who went above and beyond making sure our day was just how we wanted. Both Such lovely ladies and nothing was too much. Highly recommend this amazing place to everyone. Thankyou Keighley&James x
V401,That Amazing Place,"WOW - That amazing place.
Firstly, it certainly lives up to its name & more.


From the moment we booked to have our wedding day at TAP, we knew it was going to be special!

All the months of planning, Angie & Louise have been there every step of the way. Angie was always there on the end of an email or a phone call. To help, guide or advise!


We had our beautiful wedding day on Thursday 24th October and it was just incredible.
That amazing place, really is a special place and we feel so lucky and grateful to have got to have our wedding day there.
From the beautiful characteristisc house, to the beautiful marquee to the beautiful lake and outside grass it really has it all!

Every single one of the staff cannot do enough for you, Paul & all the team are just the loveliest people and we’re so friendly and helpful with anything we needed.




The actual day ran so smoothly with not a single hiccup and I truly beleive that was due to Angie & Louise’s efficiency! They were amazing from morning to night and constantly checked we were ok and if we needed anything.


We would reccomend this venue to anyone.. and if we could do our wedding again, we would do it here again & again.




We will always look back on our day knowing the venue was a pivotal part and with a big smile!


Thank you for everything!
All our Love,
Mr & Mrs Ackerman xxx"
V401,That Amazing Place,"Where do I start... me and my now wife got married at ""That amazing place"" and not to sound too corny, but it was amazing!

The decor was both elegant and warm, whilst the space was perfect for our cosy big day!

I don't think I could rate this place any higher, but the staff made our special day all the more magical! They offered a number of wedding packages which we were able to tailor to perfectly suit what we had dreamt of... they were also so accommodating to all of our needs and implemented them fantastically.

The venue has good disabled access, and the staff had ramps they were all too willing to move around, which helped my wheelchair using mum fully experience our big day to the fullest.

We chose to stay the night, and accommodation was clean and luxurious, not to mention the delicious breakfast the morning after.

This all added up to a 10 out of 10 day and lifelong memory, a wondrous experience for me and my new wife."
V401,That Amazing Place,We got married here in 2024. We had the most amazing day all coordinated by Angie and her amazing team! Everything about the venue was perfect and how we wanted it. We had our family dogs there too to top it all off!
V401,That Amazing Place,"We knew from when we first visited That Amazing Place that we wanted to get married there and on the day the venue really was everything we wanted it to be. Angie and the team we so great and made sure we had everything we needed.
All our guests loved the day and the place and we’re so happy with how everything turned out.
It was such a magical day and we wouldn’t have changed a thing!"
V401,That Amazing Place,"I honestly cannot recommend That Amazing Place more! Angie, Louise and the rest of the staff were incredible from start to finish. We first met Louise and Angie in February 2023 when they showed us around and we instantly knew we wanted to get married here. They couldn’t have made the experience more straightforward and stress free for us. On the day, everything was taken control of exactly how I would have wanted and everything ran smoothly thanks to Angie and Louise. Who are both so lovely and welcoming! The venue was spot on, the house is beautiful and the marquee was perfect for a party. Louise even drove us over the grass in a golf buggy to make sure we got some pictures outside without getting too wet due to the rain!
Absolutely loved staying in the wedding lodge the night before, stunning house and got everything you’d need (Angie and Louise came to say hello the night before also making me feel so relaxed about it all). Thank you so so much for everything you did for us and for making our day so perfect. Couldn’t have wished for a better venue. Lives up to its name!"
V401,That Amazing Place,"We visited a few venues before That Amazing Place, but when we met Louise and walked around the venue we knew straight away that this was the place for us.
We loved their relaxed style and felt we could really have the wedding that we wanted and it did not disappoint.
Angie helped us to organise our day and used her experience to help guide us into making some sensible decision. I really felt as though she listened to what we wanted and was willing to accommodate our plans.

On the day it was the wedding we had dreamed of. both Angie, Louise and the TAP team were on hand to make our day perfect. They beautifully set up the venue and went above and beyond to make sure we were happy throughout the day.
I couldn't be more thankful to them for helping to create our perfect wedding. I will forever be grateful to them."
V401,That Amazing Place,"Angie and Paul helped us plan the perfect wedding for us. It was the most amazing day, just what we wanted. Calm, chilled, relaxed, no stress and everyone was happy. They are highly recommended! We can not thank them enough!
Highly recommended!"
V402,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"Down Hall was our chosen venue for our wedding day in August - we had a wonderful day and the team did a great job looking after us and our guests.
We worked with Zoe as our wedding coordinator who was fantastic and responsive to our requests and communication as we planned the wedding in a short space of time in 5 months!
The chef was great and modified the menu to suit our special fusion wedding. The results were amazing with all our guests commenting on how wonderful the food was (my worst nightmare averted of guests feeling hungry or having a poor food experience!).
The whole experience with Down Hall was great. The hotel was very busy for the weekend over the summer which did not affect our wedding day itself as had a team dedicated to us. We also had a family afternoon tea arranged the day before instead of a rehearsal dinner which was also amazing with great service in our private room.
We hope to return for our first anniversary!"
V402,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"The summary I would give our wedding is that the venue is stunning however the wedding coordinators and bar staff failed on several occasions to deliver the wedding we had planned or paid for.

I really did not want to micro-mange my own wedding but this meant things didn’t go to plan. Luckily as we had evidence in writing we did receive compensation for this however that doesn’t change what happened on the day.


Here’s what happened …


Planning Issues

We emailed our final planning information 2 days prior to our final wedding planning meeting. We then had our final planning meeting with Tracy who said everything was okay and on-track. 10 days later she then admitted she had not read the documents at the time of the final planning meeting and had now found a problem. There was a problem, which was my misunderstanding, and we resolved this however this is a great example of the level of service that we received.

We had asked (thankfully via email) if we could have a musician outside during reception drinks and were told we were so we booked one. When we then visited Down Hall we were told we were not allowed a musician. As we could provide the email from them saying we could have a musician they allowed us to have one but I would recommend to any potential couples to get all communication in writing as you may need to provide what you have been told!

These are just two of several fustrating interactions we had during planning!


Time Management

The time management of the wedding coordinators is terrible. We were left waiting on every occasion that we met with them, sometimes up to 45minutes with no idea what was going on. On our wedding day we were left waiting in the reception room for 20minutes wondering again how long we would be waiting with many things to do!


Wedding Ceremony Music

We provided a detailed run-though of the wedding ceremony and when music was meant to be played (nothing complicated, pre-wedding, entrance, signing and exit songs).

- The pre-wedding ceremony music was not setup by the wedding coordinator as promised and was playing through the ipad and not speakers when the Groom arrived.
- Tracy then proceeded mid-way through the ceremony to randomly start playing the second signing music song before realising she was drowning out proceedings and switching it off.
- The Ceremony came to an end and everyone was asked to stand and out their hands together (this took quite a while as my Grandpa is disabled) despite this delay and being given a script in advance Tracy then totally missed starting the exit music until we were 3/4 of the way down the aisle.

The team did offer us compensation for this.


Horsebox Bar

We had paid £500 to reserve the terrace and horsebox bar. When we asked the Food & Beverage team to open the horsebox bar back up after the meal they had to apologise and say that there was a mix up and no staff had been booked and this was not possible.

After the wedding we then complained to the Revenue Manager who claimed that this was agreed with us and this was reflected on the function sheet which we received prior to the wedding … this was a totally untrue!

We then (rather embarrassingly for them) sent them their own function sheet and highlighted the line which said “horsebox bar and terrace after meal service”. After agreeing that both the contract and function sheet said this should be open they offered us compensation. Once again showing the importance of getting everything confirmed in writing.


Prosecco

We brought our own drink and did corkage. During the post wedding drinks I went to the horsebox bar to get a Prosecco to then be told that was the last glass. I was surprised given how much we had brought. I found two bottles in the dining room and took them to the horsebox bar. These were drunk and then guests started buying their own drinks as a result of being told this was finished.

I was then very disappointed to be handed back 8 bottles of Prosecco when we checked out. When I complained about this the Revenue Manger said the guests were drinking G&T which does not answer the complaint at all and again reflects the level of service we received.


Summary

In summary, the venue is stunning however from reading previous reviews it appears that a completely new wedding team are at Down Hall. I would only recommend this as a place to get married if you are going to micro-manage your wedding coordinator, get everything in writing, and don’t trust the function sheet as this is not guarantee things will happen."
V402,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"Wow what an amazing wedding we had at downhall, the venue was absolutely stunning and the team were amazing and always there for you along the whole journey. I could ask for more the whole day was an absolute dream and that wouldn't have been possible if not for the amazing team. Thank you so so much xxx"
V402,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"Down hall were amazing for mine & my new husbands wedding day! The whole day went so well and it was so so organised I couldn’t of felt in safer hands! Our wedding was cancelled twice due to the pandemic, and down hall were so accommodating in moving us we couldn’t complain! The only thing that went wrong was the music when I walked down the aisle temporarily stopped twice, I was so nervous for the day, I wanted the ground to swallow me up. But it wasn’t anyones fault it was just a technical glitch! But otherwise Becky, Imran & Julie especially we’re SO AMAZING I couldn’t of wished for a better wedding team! Loved it so much I’d do it all over again! And everyone commented on how accommodating & beautiful the venue was and how delicious the food was 😍 Even down the the Easter egg hunt the hotel had on the next morning for the children! It was absolutely perfect! You can tell they have all the experience! Loved it! We can’t wait to come back to stay for afternoon tea, some lush dinner & a spa day 😍"
V402,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"My husband and I got married at Down Hall in December 21. Covid cases just started to get bad again and even though Stu and I were a panicked mess in the days leading up to it, Becky, Imran and their dedicated team calmed every concern and we had the most incredible day. They are flexible, accommodating and the most reliable people I have ever met. No request was too much and they did absolutely everything they could to ensure that everything went ahead without fault. We met with the organisers the day before to discuss final details and they had everything written down and ready before we opened our mouths, even down the sticking down the sign on our post box. The smallest touches made the day magical and their attention to detail is unmatched. Because of them, we have the most fantastic memories of our day. Thank you so so much xx"
V402,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,We had the most magical wedding day! Would recommend this venue to everyone
V402,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"The Down Hall wedding team worked wonders for us when planning our special day. They’re caring, efficient and clearly have years of experience in organising weddings - the value of which cannot be underestimated. Organising a wedding in 2020 has at times felt like trying to pitch a tent in a storm only for it to be blown away given lockdown and a series of changes to wedding regulations. The team helped us to navigate the various covid regulations without letting them dominate our special day and did so with the utmost sensitivity.

The grounds and function rooms are stunning and offer a gorgeous backdrop for your ceremony, pictures and celebrations. The rooms are spacious and the Liddel suite in particular is a treasure trove of a room with all sorts of surprises including a romantic bathtub with views across the grounds. The food was delicious and the day was a success despite such difficult circumstances. Thank you Down Hall. We would not hesitate to recommend you for anyone planning a wedding in the future!"
V402,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"We got engaged in January then went to down hall on valentine a day I had been there before to stay and just knew I’d love to get married there so booked a meeting with a Julie and booked straight away the whole experience was perfect so professional and easy Julie was the reason for that she made it stress free . Our wedding day was perfect everything ran smoothly and just how I’d imagined we stayed from sat till Monday. Toast master Simon was amazing run the day brilliantly .
I would encourage anyone to get Married at Down hall perfect venue."
V402,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"Right from the start we was not even sure if we could have this fantastic venue, due to our small and intimate wedding. But to our delight, Down Hall tailored and accommodated our needs every step of the way. We must say all of the staff were brilliant in every way possible.
The food was perfect, and presented beautifully, and our guests loved it.
My husband and I had the most magical day. Once again we would like to give a massive thank you to all of the staff at Down Hall, for giving us a day that we will never forget."
V402,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"We couldn't have asked for a better day. All our friends and family are still talking about what an amazing day it was. Venue looked amazing, service was excellent and as for the beef it was exquisite.
From the moment we stepped into the venue it felt special and the wedding team made everything so easy building up to the day and on the day.
It was so good we want to do it again every year!"
V403,Newland Hall,"I'm not even sure where to begin but wow! We fell in love with this wedding venue just over a year before our wedding day and we looked at other venues but we kept comparing them all to Newland Hall. From the get go we had amazing email and phone calls with Lucy and Kelly. No question or query wasn't welcomed which I think any bride appreciates. We were able to meet with Lucy 5 weeks before our wedding day and also a few months before to refresh our memory and see the venue again before our big day which again felt just right and we picked our venue right. We were able to drop off decorations the day before our wedding (stuff for the tables, post box, seating plan, welcome sign etc) and Lucy as always greeted with us with such warmth and I think knowing Lucy was going to be there on the day made me feel so calm. Now the day. WOW. Thanks to Lucy she took what I had in mind for the tables, signs etc and made it perfect (better than I could) again no question or request was too big to ask. I had so many guests tell me how much they loved the venue and I'm hoping I can return to Newland Hall as a guest to take it all in again. The food was amazing and all of the staff working on my wedding were lovely (kept making sure I had eaten and I had a drink) If you're thinking of Newland Hall do it! I wouldn't change a thing. I want to do it all over again! Also want to mention the DJ was amazing! Music wasn't too loud which was good and he judged how well the songs were going to decide what to play next and he had a lot of patience for me as I had requested quite a lot music. I was also able to choose the music for after the wedding and dinner part which felt really personal."
V403,Newland Hall,"This Gem is tucked away in a quiet location in Chelmsford and I am glad that my partner found it randomly. When we went to visit the venue, we was blown away and very stunned at the beauty and peacefulness of the location.
The staffs, Kelly and Katerina were very professional, helpful and friendly. They truly made our day feel special. The venue was very flexible as we had to reschedule our wedding due to covid-19 restrictions on wedding. They also listened to us and our requests and tried their best to accommodate them within their capability.
We had an amazing day and thank you for making our day special!
Cloudier and Ryan"
V403,Newland Hall,"From the moment we arrived at Newland Hall for the Open day we knew we had found the perfect venue for our wedding and the actual event proved that right, and more.
Kelly and her team at Newland Hall were brilliant; in the run up to the event they were accommodating and flexible to our needs and on the day itself the whole thing ran beautifully making it a fabulous day for all involved, the ceremony was absolutely lovely and the reception and buffet that followed turned in to the relaxed and friendly garden party atmosphere that we had hoped for.

Thank you all again for a fantastic day.

Ian and Deb 23 August 2019"
V403,Newland Hall,We got married outside on 21.09.19 as the weather was perfect.! All our last minute changes were catered for by Katerina who was brilliant throughout. The venue is so pretty and perfect for what we wanted. The bbq food was lovely and the whole day flowed perfectly. Would definitely recommend.
V403,Newland Hall,"Amazing Venue, perfect for the intimate wedding we were looking for. Beautiful surroundings and 1st class service from the staff. Would highly recommend for anyone looking for a picturesque location. We married outside with the BBQ option which was amazing too! Thank you, Newland Hall!
Ella & Darren Crossman 5th September 2019"
V403,Newland Hall,"The most perfect wedding Venue, got married here on Saturday and had the best day, people could not stop complimenting the venue and the food and all the staff it was amazing. We had Fran as our wedding co-ordinator, and she was amazing and done such an amazing job. Everything went so well and it’s because of her, she set it all up just how I wanted it and she made sure I didn’t have to think about anything on the day. We had a lot of guests, 150 during the day and more in the evening, so she had her work cut out, but she really did amazingly, you could see how hard she worked. Thank you so much Newland Hall and most importantly Fran she was amazing. Couldn’t recommend this venue and Fran highly enough.
Becky & Daniel Harrington"
V403,Newland Hall,"We got married here on May Bank Holiday Monday and we could not be happier!
We chose Newland Hall because of the exclusivity, the beautiful house and outside space! We were married outside under the gazebo which we were able to decorate with flowers and sashes. The grounds are absolutely gorgeous, with plenty of photo opportunities, in and around the house, marquee and the nearby fields and lakes! The food was delicious and the guests were full of compliments! Our wedding planner, Fran, was absolutely amazing, she set the venue up and dealt with everything, making it completely stress free, for us and our guests! Nothing was too much! Thank you!
It’s a shame it’s all over, but thank you for being so accommodating! We would definitely recommend.
Jasmine & Dan Banks"
V403,Newland Hall,"WOW .....! What can I say?? We got married at Newland Hall on the 01.09.19 and it was the best day of our lives. I firstly want to thank Katerina our wedding coordinator for all her hard work in the lead up to the wedding and her organisational skills on the day really shone through, she was amazing from start to finish making our day even more special. I would also like to thank the director Simon for all his help in the run up to our wedding also. The food and service were second to none and everyone commented on the food. It was a truly amazing experience from start to finish. The staff were attentive and friendly and kept the drinks flowing so everyone could enjoy themselves. There were no long waits at the bar either which kept things flowing. A massive, massive thank you to everyone at Newland Hall for making our day that little bit more special, they really made us feel so special.
Mr & Mrs Swinney"
V403,Newland Hall,"Everyone who attended the wedding and reception said they had a fabulous time and dealing with Newland Hall and yourself has been a very thorough and enjoyable experience.

Thank you for everything you did and also to all of the other staff who helped make our wedding day such a great day."
V403,Newland Hall,"Thank you so much for everything, our day couldn’t have gone any better! We had so many guests saying to us what an amazing venue it is and also how great the staff are, and we obviously completely agree with them, we definitely made the best choice!"
V404,Creeksea Place,"We knew Creeksea would be the venue for us when we first happened to see pictures of the Manor and grounds online some years ago. From the moment we arrived for our appointment to meet with Claire who was helpful, friendly and flexible to try and make our day exactly as we wanted it. We kept in contact with Claire for any questions and checking ideas until we were allocated Carly as our coordinator. Carly was absolutely wonderful, answering texts and calls whenever things came up and reassured us to no end about the weather! Carly’s knowledge of the venue and talking to us, helped plan a really good day and we were so well taken care of by the team at Creeksea who linked in with our vendors so seamlessly.

We had never seen the venue in summer/sunlight before our wedding day and we were absolutely blown away with how gorgeous Creeksea is. Everything tied together and Carly kept us both so calm and relaxed throughout. Every guest we spoke to commented on how beautiful the venue is and how everything was just perfect, with one person asking “can you do this every week?”. If we could, we would. We cannot thank everyone enough and will remember the day forever.
Thank you again."
V404,Creeksea Place,"We had a twilight wedding at creeksea last month and it was absolutely perfect. We live locally and always knew we wanted to get married at creeksea as it’s such a hidden gem.
We booked only 5 months before the date so it was quite a short lead in time and as a result we had lots of questions! Claire was absolutely fantastic and responded to every query quickly and with a personal touch.
The whole process, from start to finish, was amazing. Nothing was too much trouble. The fact that creeksea isn’t one of these wedding venues that books numerous weddings a week resulting in you become more of a number than an actual wedding was worth its weight in gold. We were made to feel so special.
The day itself was amazing. It truly is the most breathtaking venue. Our guests were blown away with how beautiful it was.
The food truck in the evening was an absolute smash with the guests. The food was out of this world and everyone is still talking about how good it was.
We would recommend creeksea over and over again to anyone looking for the most beautiful and personal wedding, it’s truly spectacular and the service you receive simply cannot be compared.
It was the most magical day and we want to do it all over again."
V404,Creeksea Place,"Creeksea Place Manor House in BoC for us was simply the perfect choice location for our special day. Not only is this gem site local to us, the venue itself is stunning & the staff are professional, helpful & friendly. Although our wedding was small & intimate of which is what we wanted, it was still perfect, details for us included having use of the bridal suite for myself as the bride to get ready alongside my mother & best friend & for my husband he could relax & have a drink/catch up with the family before the ceremony feeling very relaxed. Lastly financially it was fantastic value for money & even if we decided to have the whole day/package for a larger wedding the pricing is still very reasonable."
V404,Creeksea Place,"This is the most gorgeous venue and we are so glad we chose it for our wedding venue. There are so many photo opportunities, and so many different options for ceremony backdrops. Claire, our wedding venue coordinator, was fantastic. She literally answered any question I had at all times of the day. She made our day run smoothly and helped it be the most perfect day. Cannot recommend this venue and the staff enough."
V404,Creeksea Place,"We had our twilight wedding here and the venue is absolutely breathtaking!! Clare and Carly were amazing!! I must’ve messaged Clare 200 times and each time I got a lovely and fast response. No stress approach and I really felt the excitement was shared (that they love what they do). Me and my partner are very much into heavy metal and abit morbid 😅 we incorporated this into our evening and everything was embraced with open minds and arms!. The staff were all wonderful, the food truck was incredible and everyone raved about their food so I cannot recommend them enough also. The lawn games were a massive hit too! Everything was just absolutely perfect and everyone had a fantastic time.

A massive thank you to all of the Creeksea team!"
V404,Creeksea Place,"We recently got married here and couldn't have asked for a better venue. The grounds & house speak for themselves, as soon as we saw it we fell in love, but the staff are the real stars. Nothing was too much hassle, they were so accommodating, responsive & helpful. Carly is fantastic & made sure everything went smoothly on the day. Claire was brilliant too & was great in the build up to the big day. They couldn't have done more for us. Highly recommend Creeksea to anyone and everyone! Thank you for making our day so special."
V404,Creeksea Place,"Had our wedding her on Thursday and despite the outbreak of rain, the team made alternative plans to accommodate us and our guests! Had a wonderful night, thank you to all the team for helping us coordinate our day effectively!!!"
V404,Creeksea Place,"My Husband and l absolutely fell in love with this wedding venue the 1st time we visited there. Its a stunning venue and truly is a hidden gem and brings happy emotions every time I see it. To top off such a stunning venue. I have to send massive compliments to all the staff. They make Creeksea extra special. From the day we put a deposit down to book our special day, until after our wedding day the Management have been the other end of the phone whenever we needed them, day or night. On the day every single staff member was on point they were attentive, friendly and almost felt like family.
Being an older couple in our 40's we booked a twighlight wedding package which was great value for money. This included street food which all our guests and us absolutely loved was so tasty and worth the money. Even the DJ was great that came as part of the package. He was in contact prior to our big day and tailored the music exactly to our preferences. We did spend more on some optional extras, like drink packages, lanterns etc but all still within our budget.
The best wedding venue by far around in my opinion and my guests couldn't believe how great Creeksea was too.
We definitely be re visiting at some point for a stay out of wedding season.
5 star + venue by far."
V404,Creeksea Place,"We instantly knew we were going to book Creeksea when we stepped through the entrance gates. A beautiful Tudor red brick building which felt hidden amongst tall enveloping trees. The perfect setting for our English fairytale wedding! Moving into the orchard we were again blown away by the intimate peaceful nature of this venue with rabbits wondering the grounds and the simple sound of birdsong to keep us company. In the lead up to our day Carly, Claire and the rest of the team couldn’t do enough for us. Responding to questions so quickly and giving us their experienced advice which meant we got the most out of our day. They were also very accommodating with requests such as including a ring warming ceremony (which we decided on three days before the wedding day!) and an outdoor sparkler last dance under their fairy-lit trees, a standout highlight from our day! We were originally drawn to Creeksea for its stunning natural beauty but now see the true gem of this place are the people that work there. We can’t wait to return for future anniversaries and already feel a part of the Creeksea family."
V404,Creeksea Place,"Wow !!!! Everything was absolutely gorgeous the grounds , the bridal cottage, the exquisite Manor House. Every expectation was met by Claire, Michelle And of course John Paul . The planning was spot on and we’ll taken care of . We asked lots and lots and lots of questions and everything was answered. All recommendations from food to fireworks to dj flowers and balloons all were exceptional. The team at Creeksea really do go above and beyond. We could not recommend any higher than we do . They worked within our budget and delivered everything to the T with all our requests. A truly beautiful location and absolutely lovely team , if there was a fairytale godmother for weddings Creeksea is it !!! Love Emma and Grant Wylde"
V405,Rivenhall Oaks Golf Centre,"Charlotte and James couldn't do enough for us. From booking til leaving the day behind they were truly a delight to deal with.

An amazing venue with great picturesque views."
V405,Rivenhall Oaks Golf Centre,"The venue met all our requirements, canapé and champagne reception, 3 course served meal and event buffet for our guests. The food and service was outstanding.

The DJ was excellent and kept the dance floor going all evening. The staff went above and beyond when they used there own cars to shuttle our guests to the coach that couldn’t get up the drive!

A big thank you to Kelly, Jack and all the team for making our day so memorable. A fantastic place to have your wedding reception, we wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone."
V405,Rivenhall Oaks Golf Centre,"All the guests loved the venue and setting. The food was great and plenty of it which made happy wedding guests. It all went to quick so we will have to do it again some day.

Once again, thank you for all your help getting family to the coach and yet again collecting us from the lane. Your team were amazing."
V406,Downham Hall,"We had our very small interment wedding reception at Downham hall and can honestly say that every single member of staff made our day exceptionally special.
Nothing was ever too much trouble with a member of staff always close by to see to our every need.
If you are considering booking your day or special event at Downham Hall please don’t hesitate as you won’t be disappointed.
Can’t thank you all enough, will definitely see you again soon"
V406,Downham Hall,"We got married at Downham Hall in July 2023 and cannot recommend this venue enough! The location, grounds, rooms and surrounding views are absolutely stunning.

The service was outstanding, the staff worked so hard to make sure everything ran smoothly on the day and were very helpful and informative during the planning process.

The wedding packages they offer are very comprehensive and flexible meaning you can make your wedding day bespoke to you. For example we wanted completely meat free (vegetarian) catering which they were more than happy to create a bespoke menu for us. You also get use of the bridal dressing room and overnight stay in the beautiful hotel rooms included.

I highly recommend you visit the venue to see it for yourself and if you do decide to book it for your wedding day, I’m sure you won’t regret it 💕"
V406,Downham Hall,"We had our wedding here 2 days ago. It’s a beautiful venue, the staff were great, really helpful, nothing was a bother when we asked them for anything. The food was fabulous and the accommodation is lovely. I would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a venue in Essex."
V406,Downham Hall,"We had an extremely tiny, completely bespoke wedding day at Downham Hall. It was absolutely perfect and everything we had hoped it would be. Christina, Debra and all the staff were amazing from start to finish and nothing was too much trouble. I cannot recommend Downham Hall highly enough. We have been back numerous times since. It’s like coming home."
V406,Downham Hall,"After two cancelled dates due to Covid at another venue, my (now) husband and I decided we were tired of waiting and got in touch with the team at Downham Hall just 5 weeks before we were going to tie the knot.

They really couldn’t have done more to accommodate our last-minute request. The team made us feel so so welcome, the venue was stunning, the food incredible and we had the most amazing day.

I really couldn’t recommend Downham Hall more!"
V406,Downham Hall,"Downham Hall proved to be the perfect choice of wedding venue. It's a beautiful country house with stunning grounds and an amazing team, who went above and beyond from start to finish, to make our day perfect. Genuinely can't recommend highly enough.

We were able to choose exactly what food we wanted for our wedding Breakfast and evening meal (even allowing us to provide our own signature cocktail to our guests!) The staff were very attentive throughout the day and the breakfast the morning after with our closest family was amazing! Would highly recommend as a wedding venue. We both still enjoy going back to the venue for meals and afternoon teas now, the views are beautiful and food always amazing!"
V406,Downham Hall,"Oooo I cant believe its been 2 years since our Wedding at Downham hall. The venue was perfect.

There is just so much character in the building and the grounds surrounding Downham hall. Everyone at Downham hall are friendly and helpful, its so lovely that Christina and Andrew are so invested in all their guests. Everything on the day ran perfectly, which I knew it would. The food!

V407,Marygreen Manor Hotel,"We had our Wedding Reception at Marygreen Manor Hotel with family and friends in from the U.S., South America, and the UK. The Hotel, venue, and staff were amazing to us from the planning stage or our wedding, which we were doing from the US, to our actual wedding date. They offered bilingual staff, incredible service and professionalism to both us and our guests. The venue is gorgeous and our wedding pictures really highlighted the beauty of Marygreen Manor.

V408,The Manor at Bickley,"The Manor is the perfect venue for weddings! When our wedding venue fell through 4 months before the big day, I stumbled onto the Manor at Bickley and spoke to Craig. He was most helpful and kind and went above and beyond to make sure our wedding went ahead.

We hired the venue for our two day wedding and the staff were helpful and accommodating from start to finish. All of our guests were awed by the beautiful well kept grounds and the excellent service. We can’t thank the staff enough for making our wedding dreams a reality. They thought of every detail from bringing us champagne after our civil ceremony to making sure we had our card box at the end of the night! We are excited to head back to celebrate our anniversary there!"
V408,The Manor at Bickley,"Myself and my Husband chose this venue for our wedding last week and we can’t sing The Manor’s praises enough. From our very first enquiry, to the first viewing of the venue, right though until the big day, the staff at the manor have been nothing short of brilliant! Each staff member we came across was polite and accommodating. Special mention to Craig and Vicky with whom we did most of our liaising throughout the months leading up until our wedding. Craig and Vicky were super helpful, responsive and went above and beyond to make sure that we could have the day of our dreams. Even with last minute changes due to the weather, Craig who was just incredible throughout, managed to help us sort a backup plan so our day would still go ahead seamlessly.

The rooms at the manor were spacious and modern, giving us and our wedding party lots of space for photographers and videographers to capture the special moments on our wedding morning.

The lodge that was used for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready was fabulous. The manor was very flexible in giving us early access so we could get ready on time.

The grand marquee was definitely grand! Very spacious and when decorated looked like something out of a fairytale! lots of kitchen space, a huge bar and fantastic overhead speakers for the party!

The manor was super flexible to our needs regarding access, start times, outsourcing our vendors and much more. The venue is beautiful and spacious with options for outdoor and indoor events and entertainment. The grounds were absolutely beautiful, so many lovely spots for photos not only for us as the bride and groom but for guests too!

A very special thank you to our point of contact throughout, Craig. From our first meeting, he was charming, bubbly and made us feel super welcome. He reassured us that he has experience in African/Caribbean weddings and that our wedding day would amazing and it was. He was attentive and always let us know that he was only a phone call or e-mail away and was always quick to respond and answer any questions we had.

All in all, we had the most beautiful day at The manor and we would definitely recommend this venue for a wedding or other events.

V408,The Manor at Bickley,"We hired The Manor at Bickley for my daughters wedding. Got a brilliant service from the venue. Everything was set accordingly, as per floor plan. Our guests were loved the venue grounds/facilities and the overall wedding set up.
Thank you to everyone at Bickley."
V408,The Manor at Bickley,"A warm and friendly service from the very helpful staff, a feeling that it is your own house! The food was amazing and the atmosphere made us and our guests feel fantastic."
V409,Channels,"No words could describe how beautiful and stunning Channels Estate is. Right from the very start of viewing Channels all the way to our wedding day, we were made to feel comfortable. The communication was absolutely amazing and they helped make our day a very special day. Katie was our coordinator, she was kind, sweet and helped us make our day one to remember. We would highly recommend Channels Estate

Mr & Mrs Edwards"
V409,Channels,Katie made our dream come true. She was attentive and organised which made the running of our day feel so smooth and organic. The venue itself is stunning and luckily we had nice weather which just made the day even better. Everyone loved the food and the service was excellent. Couldn’t have asked for more.
V409,Channels,"Channels provided a great experience throughout. The team (led by Karen) were extremely helpful throughout - they accomodated all of our needs, worked well with the suppliers and coordinated the day brilliantly. Venue was set up beautifully and food was of a high standard. On site hotel rooms were luxurious and reasonably priced for our guests. Would recommend the venue without question."
V409,Channels,"We got married 31st March 2023 at channels, from the moment we booked channels Karen and her team were incredible, communication was great all the way through. Our actual day was fantastic from morning till night Karen and all the staff were helpful, friendly and just couldn't do enough for us and our guests! Would highly recommend channels"
V409,Channels,"Wedding Day - 9th April 2023
Couldn't be happier with the venue and how our wedding day went, Karen and the rest of the staff were brilliant and took care of everything for us and always made sure we were alright and that it all went perfectly. They were lots of fun and we couldn't recommend them highly enough. Thanks!"
V409,Channels,"The venue is stunning, food is beautiful. And the staff are welcoming happy and seriously can not do enough for you.
Nothing is too much.
Can not rate this place enough."
V409,Channels,"What a perfect day we had, marrying at The Channels Estate. A couple of months before our wedding day, our wedding co-ordinator needed to be changed. We were handed over from Molly to Katie, and the handover couldn't be smoother. Both Molly before, and Katie once handed over couldn't have been more helpful. A couple of weeks before our day I began to have bride jitters about the planning and organisation of decoration etc. Katie replied to my email very quickly, putting my mind at ease.
On our big day, Hayley and Karen couldn't have been nicer and more helpful. Hayley single handedly tidied the outside area before our ceremony as it had been left quite a mess from the previous wedding the day before, and Karen was on hand following the ceremony with the electric swatter to deter any wasps after the Pimms! Every member of staff we spoke with was lovely and did all they could to ensure we had the most wonderful and calm wedding day. Channels is a beautiful venue, I just wish we could do it all again! Thank you all :)
Jasmine and Dave x"
V409,Channels,"I am a little late in writing this review as we got married in September 2021. It truly was the best day ever and we are so glad that we chose Channels for our wedding day. We knew it was the venue for us, from our first visit where we met with Paul and he showed us around. The venue had everything we wanted, a beautiful barn, great grounds and lots of gorgeous accommodation, which was a must for us. We stayed the night before in The Retreat, which was amazing, with lots of room for us to get ready and although the weather was not on our side, and we could not get married in the ceremony garden, in the end it didn't really matter. Molly was our coordinator and she was incredible. It was like she could read my mind, and everything was exactly as we wanted, without us even having to think about it. The day went by in a flash and the venue looked amazing. We didn't have to think or worry, it all just happened seamlessly. The staff worked so hard and the food was amazing. All our guests had the best time and were so complementary about the venue and they loved the accommodation. It really was perfect the day. The best part is that, as it's not just a wedding venue we can visit again if we want to and book to stay in the hotel for our anniversary. Also must not forget to mention James who works at the hotel. He must have rearranged our accommodation booking so many times and was so kind and helpful. We had to postpone by 6 weeks due to a member of our immediate family becoming temporarily ill. James, Paul and Molly were very understanding while we tried to rearrange our wedding day to work with all our guests and suppliers. 10/10"
V409,Channels,"Wow! What can I say?! There are quite literally no words to explain how wonderful channels is. From start to finish, Paul, Eleanor and the whole team could not have been more friendly and accommodating. They took our vision and made it reality without breaking the bank too much. Every single element was perfect from food to decor to operation. It was faultless. Everyone adored the food and said just how beautiful it looked. Thank you to the most wonderful team! We appreciate you so much!

If you’re considering channels…….just do it!"
V409,Channels,"Channels staff were fantastic both in the planning of the day and organisation on the actual wedding day, we couldn’t fault them. Staff were friendly, helpful and proactive. The wedding day was amazing and so many people commented that it was the best wedding they’d been too.

We planned our wedding for what turned out to be during the pandemic. Channels were so proactive, responsive and helpful with rearranging our day, and even helpful with our wedding insurance claim for the rearrangement.

It’s a stunning venue with plenty of outside space. We’d thoroughly recommend it :)"
V410,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"Firstly Christie and Sarah the Wedding Coordinators were so friendly and couldn’t do enough for us on and before our wedding day! They were so approachable and personable. The staff at Greenwoods were all so friendly, helpful and genuinely cared about us having the best wedding day it was so very appreciated! All of the staff, from the maintenance and support staff right through to the management went above and beyond to make our stay and wedding the best experience. One lady cleaning our room went out of her way to help us with getting extra towels and bits we needed on my wedding day. Another gentleman who served us for breakfast also went above and beyond to upgrade us to a better room because our TV and electric went off in our bridal suite and they wanted us to have the best experience, which was such a nice touch and honestly made our experience so much better! Cannot fault the place! 5 stars!!!"
V410,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"Everyone has commented to me how gorgeous our wedding venue was and they aren’t lying.
Service was second to none, every staff member in that building treated me like I was a celebrity throughout my stay there for our wedding and I will never forget it!
Special mention to Shannen who looked after us thoroughly throughout wedding planning
Love Mr & Mrs Stam

V410,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"We got married at Greenwoods recently and I all can say is wow and thank you!!

Our day ran perfectly and that’s solely down to the staff here - some of who were working all day - but even by the end of our night, nothing we asked for was too much trouble.

The food was outstanding - we had many guests comment on how great it was especially seeing as they were catering for 100+ guests - it didn’t feel like a typical ‘large event’ meal but something you would expect in a restaurant.

The venue is perfect, beautiful grounds and a stunning garden suite and there was no stress for my husband and I as everything was looked after, the staff clearly have a lot of experience in weddings as they were there and ready for the next part of the day before we were!

I couldn’t recommend Greenwoods enough to any couples thinking of choosing it as their wedding venue!

Thank you again!"
V410,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"Cannot put into words just how perfect this was. 2 night stay plus wedding ceremony, reception and evening. The attention to detail was fantastic. Venue stunningly beautiful. Food was lovely and service very good. Wedding coordinator was excellent. It really was just perfect"
V410,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"Perfect venue for a perfect wedding.
The whole day ran like clockwork and nothing was too much trouble for the staff team as we were gently directed throughout the day. My niece looked beautiful and happy as she walked up the aisle in the lovely gardens.
We had a brilliant time and at the end of the day an extremely comfortable bed.
Thank you so much."

V410,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"It was faultless from the moment we arrived to the moment we left.
Great rooms, more than pleasant staff (who bent backwards to accommodate the six of us plus two children under 5 ) the wedding, the wedding reception, the food and then the great breakfast in the morning
I would highly recommend this place !"
V410,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"This is a gem of a place which deserves much wider recognition.
Don't usually write reviews but felt compelled to break my code of silence for this experience. My daughter chose Greenwoods Hotel & Spa as her preferred choice of venue for her wedding reception.
From the moment she and her entourage arrived at 7.30am on the day of the wedding the staff could not have been more helpful. The level of service and attention to detail were exceptional. Shannon, the hotel's wedding co-ordinator, was on hand throughout the day and evening giving re assurance, confidence and updates on timings and procedures which is what you need on days like these. Such a cool mature head on young shoulders!
Food and silver service at the wedding breakfast were impressive and plenty of bar staff on hand throughout the evening so none of those unseemly 'scrums' ever developed at the bar for drinks; and the Garden Suite function room literally takes your breath away when decorated.
Overnight accommodation did not disappoint and breakfast plentiful.
So if you are planning a wedding put Greenwoods on your short list. You won't regret it."
V410,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"We recently got married at Greenwoods. From start to finish it was a perfect experience. The Library room was stunning, the reception room was beautiful. Nothing was ever too much trouble. All the staff on the day were happy, helpful and brilliant. The food received constant compliments - it was delicious!!!!
As a very nervous bride I wouldn't have been without Shannen - our wedding coordinator. She was simply amazing - made me feel relaxed and really special - i just loved the care and attention. The whole day went without a hitch and Shannen and the team even delivered beautiful sunny weather! We are so so pleased we picked Greenwoods for our wedding. We cant wait to head back for a stay on our anniversary! Thank you everyone!! love, Michelle and Jon xxxx"
V410,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"Chris and i would just like to say a huge thank you to you and all the staff involved in making our wedding the best day of our lives. The day ran so smoothly and that is all thanks to you and the amazing team at Greenwood’s. So many of our guests have commented on the day from how beautiful the venue was decorated, to the delicious food and the friendly staff.

The day completely surpassed our expectations and we we cannot thank you enough for making it the most special and amazing day of our lives.

Thank you again,

Chris and Helen"
V411,Crondon Park,"In terms of the beauty of crondon park you can see for yourself...

But the care of the people that work there were unbelievable. Honestly, nothing is too much for them. You are paying a lot to get married (anywhere!) but somehow most people still feel embarrassed to ask lots of questions or things they don't understand. Crondon never made us feel bad for asking questions and clarifying things, asking for adjustments and just being reassuring.

They were so helpful on the lead up, everything was clear and on the day they were faultless. I'd definitely recommend them to anyone!

We had 103 guests so on the higher side and it was still plenty of space.

The food was also incredible!"
V411,Crondon Park,"It was an amazing day! The place looked stunning.
Thank you for your hard work. You have made our special day incredible"
V411,Crondon Park,We had the most special day! I honestly do not think I could have changed a thing!! We were so well looked after for the entire day
V411,Crondon Park,"We had an absolute fantastic day, everything ran smoothly and staff was so helpful and friendly. Jo our front of house was lovely and helped us throughout the day, even when my veil needing securing she was able to help. We would highly recommend Crondon Park, our day was so special and would love to do it all again xx"
V411,Crondon Park,"My partner and I first visited the venue after getting engaged back in February 2023. We were greeted by Kara, who was nothing short of friendly and supportive. It was one of the first venues we had seen and booked the next day.

The process towards the big day was excellent. We would regularly be in contact with Ellie who would also answer any questions or queries we had. The communication was always quick and reassuring. We came to a few afternoon tea and special dinners they organise to get more of a feel for the place and we knew we had made the right decision.

As for the big day itself on 12.4.25, well it was absolutely perfect. Our front of house Jo, was nothing short of amazing, professional, friendly and went above and beyond what we expected. Thank you Jo! The food was absolutely delicious, the service was impeccable. A big thank you to all the chefs, waiters, cleaners and anyone else who was involved behind the scenes to make our big day so magical. The rooms were also amazing for our guests, as well as the Lily Suite, that me and my friends stayed in the night before. And of course, the honeymoon suite too.

We cannot thank Crondon Park enough for making our wedding so special. If we could do it all again, we would. Who knows maybe a renewal of vowels one day? :D

We would highly recommend this venue to any couple. 5 star service from start to finish. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you Crondon Park! The big day and experience will be cherished in our memories forever."
V411,Crondon Park,"I would like to say a huge thank you to the team at Crondon Park for making our wedding the most amazing smooth-running day. And a special thank you to Kayleigh and Kara, it truly shows how passionate you are about your Job.

Having our wedding at the beginning of December, Crondon Park had already had their Christmas touch décor up, the sun going down early made the fairy lights extra magical.

From the moment we booked the team were very attentive and reliable at getting back to emails throughout the months leading up to the wedding. I’m a big believer that communication is the key, and they had made everything stress free. They met our every need and went above and beyond to accommodate our requests.

Our guests are still talking about it until this day, the food had high compliments, even heard it was the best brownie they had ever tasted!

No words can explain this day in a nutshell, but I will say, if you are considering booking this Venue for your special day, then please do not hesitate!

Eve & Roberto xxx"
V411,Crondon Park,"A fantastic day, really well organised, great venue and fantastic food and service! Thank you so much for helping make it an amazing day"
V411,Crondon Park,"Wow, absolutely fantastic day from start to finish.
Beautiful rooms, lovely food and service.
Lovely breakfast the next day a well.
Perfect!!"
V411,Crondon Park,"Such a great wedding, good vibes, i would definitely recommend!
I also have several allergies that the staff dealt with easily, extremely helpful.
Thank you all so much"
V411,Crondon Park,"We had the most perfect day, thank you so much for everything.
It was just amazing! Every one of our guests constantly said what a beautiful venue it was. We both really appreciate all the hard work everyone put into not just yesterday but over these last 2 years."
V412,Villiers Barn,"I don’t think the words I’m trying to find even exist in the dictionary, to describe this truly breathtaking, spectacular, unique, initiate venue - VILLIERS BARN is out of this world and that’s all down to Juliet & Barry, the Venue owners & directors & their son Jonathan who offer a 7-star, first class service. All three are extremely passionate about their business & they go above and beyond from the moment we viewed, booked & then had our wedding (last Thursday), no job was too big for them.

We viewed VILLIERS during its renovation & as soon as we drove up the lane, there was something so very special about where we had just arrived, historic, traditional - but different from any other typical barn wedding venue I’d seen online / been to as a guest. VILLIERS holds something special & unique.

VILLIERS was the first & only venue we viewed - we knew it was the one for us. We went back to see progress & it just kept getting better and better. I can’t praise the venue, the setting, the owners & staff enough.
We had an Amalfi (Italian) Coast themed wedding, the barn is simply stunning & speaks for itself - our theme fitted in perfectly, but as would any other theme over the last year I’ve seen villiers host many weddings & no two weddings have been the same it’s incredible - versatile VILLIERS! 👏🏽

Every time we viewed VILLIERS after booking, I felt so choked in the ceremony room, the barn, by the lake as I just knew this was the only place I see myself getting married to my fiancé, our wedding day was perfect & we have had fabulous comments from family and friends - saying it was the best venue & best wedding they’d ever been to, spectacular settings & top class service and so well organised.

To Juliet, Barry & Jonathan and their wonderful staff - your passion shines through & we can’t thank you enough for having us & making our day perfect, I’m so sad our wedding day is over - but the memories we’ve created will last forever & will play out like a film in our minds.

I can’t recommend VILLIERS BARN enough, if you want the best wedding, then book the best venue.

Thank you all again,

Harriette & Charlie Blackshaw-Clare 🤍🍋💙"
V412,Villiers Barn,"Where do I even begin with this beautiful venue?! From the very first visit to Villiers Barn, we knew this was the venue for us! The whole family were super friendly and helpful when showing us around after the first viewing we were hooked and knew we had to have our wedding here!

Throughout the whole year Jonathan was especially helpful with all the communications, questions and on hand to help with anything, nothing was too much trouble!

When it came to the wedding day everything happened with such ease, Jonathan, Becky and Ellen were on hand and made the day super smooth including the help setting up the venue making it perfect!! They gave us the wedding day of our dreams! It couldn't have been more perfect and everyone was so attentive in getting our drinks, taking us where we needed to be, the food was INCREDIBLE also and will be dreaming of that for a lifetime! Also the new seating area outside with the log heart is a lovely touch!

I couldn't recommend this venue highly enough and can't thank everyone at Villiers for the most memorable day!"
V412,Villiers Barn,"5 stars is not enough. We got married here on 22nd March 2025 and from the moment we booked the whole team were so responsive and helpful. The whole day went so smoothly thanks to the incredible team. A big thank you to you all for helping set the venue up exactly as we wanted and talking the time to ask questions where needed. The food was delicious and the portions were perfect, we received comments all day long from our guests saying how much they enjoyed all the food and drink on offer. The venue itself is absolutely stunning. Neither ourselves or our guests wanted for anything all day long as the service was outstanding. Truly thank you for helping us have one the best days of our lives."
V412,Villiers Barn,"We got married in Villiers Barn on November 7th 2024.

The minute we viewed the barn back in September 2022, we knew this is the place we were going to say ‘I do’.
Juliet, Jonathan and all of the team that work at Villiers are absolutely incredible!
2 years of constant communication, answering any questions we had and just checking in on us, this made our countdown even more exciting!

The BIG day arrived and we couldn’t have asked for anything more. The day ran smoothly and I would even say perfectly!
Jonathan was incredible, letting us have our time we needed, checking everything was okay and when we wanted to do certain timeline of events if we were busy talking to guests (or even dancing away), there was no pressure.

Not forgetting the Venue & grounds are stunning in itself & with the amazing team you’d be silly not to book to have your wedding here!

I’ve told everyone it was the best day of our lives and it truly was! Thank you for making our day amazing, I will never forget the dedication of the team for making our day so special and personal to us. 🤍

Shaun & Ellice
Mr & Mrs Baker"
V412,Villiers Barn,"Villiers Barn is an absolutely stunning wedding venue with so much rustic charm! From the moment we booked, the team went above and beyond to make everything perfect, and Juliet in particular was incredible—so helpful, kind, and attentive throughout the whole process. The food was fantastic, fresh and beautifully presented every detail felt thoughtfully planned. If you're looking for a beautiful, welcoming venue with a brilliant team, Villers Barn is the perfect choice."
V412,Villiers Barn,"Wow where do we even begin?

We got married at Villiers Barn in December & it was truly our dream venue. After visiting a few venues in Essex & Suffolk (which hadn’t ticked all our boxes), Villiers was the last venue we visited & wow we did save the best until last! The venue itself is gorgeous and suitable for any wedding across the seasons. The venue has a mix of a classic/rustic feel but also really modern and elegant. We fell in love as soon as we saw it. Juliet showed us around initially & we fell in love with her too!! She is so passionate about what she does & cares so much about you, making you feel so welcome! She makes you feel so special and taken care of. We loved that Villiers is also a family run business & knew this was the venue for us.

We really can’t fault the Villiers Barn Team.…Jonathan was BRILLIANT at providing information and responding to all our questions over the two years we spent planning. His replies were always so quick and this was honestly so reassuring for us, and made us feel like we were in very safe hands. He arranged our taster evening for us (which we highly recommend) where we essentially had a private dinner date at the venue, tasting the food options. He also helped arrange any visits we wanted at the venue in the lead up.

Becky helped us to set up the day before our wedding & also co-ordinated the wedding day for us with Juliet. We can’t thank Becky enough for all the help, support & love she showed not only us but all our bridal party and guests. She went above and beyond to make sure everything ran seamlessly for us (along with the rest of the Villiers team we had on the day).

The day itself ran so smoothly, with all our guests complimenting us on how beautiful the venue was. Even in the storm, wind & rain, the venue is just beautiful. We also had such delicious food that came out piping hot - all our guests were raving about how good the food was throughout the day.

At the end of the wedding day, we stayed in the honeymoon lodge accommodation which was so convenient & so lovely waking up the next morning with breakfast already prepared for us.

We really had the best day and are so grateful to everyone at Villiers Barn! We can't thank you enough! We really hope we get to visit again as guests for a wedding in the future.

Lots of love from Mr & Mrs Stanway xx"
V412,Villiers Barn,"Villiers barn wedding venue will always hold a special place in our hearts after our big day on 25th October 2024

Jonathan was so supportive, helpful and had so much knowledge whenever we needed guidance whilst planning our big day. We also met Jonathan’s mother, Wife and sister who were equally helpful if needed.

As soon as we see the venue we fell in love and knew we wanted villiers to host our special day. The venue has a really warm feel to it. The grounds and barn are spectacular and the attention to detail was out of this world

We cant thank everyone at villiers enough for helping make such a special memorable day. We loved every second."
V412,Villiers Barn,"From the moment we went and visited the venue, we were in awe of how beautiful it is.

Still, that means very little without a wonderful team, and Villier's Barn delivers in spades. Jonathan, Juliet, Becky, and everyone else we've dealt with were unbelievable.

From Jonathan answering our millions of questions as we approached the big day, to Juliet being so warm and helpful when dropping off our assorted decorations, to Becky literally putting on buttonholes right before the ceremony, we couldn't have asked for a better experience.

Everything ran smoothly, the staff were helpful throughout the day, and nothing was ever too much trouble. My wife and I are genuinely a little sad we can't do it all over again!"
V412,Villiers Barn,"Villiers Barn was the first and only venue we viewed. It was absolutely breathtaking from the minute we viewed it. The staff were very warm and welcoming. We then booked it and throughout the whole process nothing was too much trouble for the Villiers Barn Team. They did an amazing job on the day of our wedding and met and went above and beyond our expectations and we are extremely grateful.
The biggest of thank you's to Juliet, Jonathan & Becky.
All our love Richard & Chanel x"
V412,Villiers Barn,"Where do I begin? Villiers Barn was the only venue we viewed. To when my Fiancé proposed and I found the venue through my photographer I knew I’d found the place I wanted to get married in.

From our viewing with Juliet, we signed on the dotted line there and then. Jonathan was then a constant communication path for my 1000s of questions over the next 3 years. If I could give 1000*s I would, Jonathan was our rock! He would answer every question, provide every detail, no request was to much trouble and I genuinely felt so calm throughout the whole process.

The family team at Villiers care about your wedding day as much as you do, you’re treated like royalty & your guests will have the most incredible day. Down to the morning of the wedding Becky was just amazing, making sure me and my bridesmaids had everything we needed. To the ceremony and day when Jonathan had everything coordinated. My glass was always topped up, food was served by the masses and was incredible. Our music played through out the day and the little moments we had in our honeymoons lodge for some time to ourselves was so special. Jonathan and his wonderful wife & partner made sure everything was packed for us to ferry away the following morning, they even arranged special gift we received while staying at the lifehouse spa after the wedding.

I want everyone I know to get married at Villiers so they can experience the most incredible day as we did.. and of course catch up with our Villiers family.

Thank you again for absolutely everything, words simply aren’t enough. All of our love always Samantha & Adam xxxxx"
V413,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"Amy, Vicky and Laura were absolutely amazing throughout the whole process of my wedding, the planning, the lead up and the day itself. Nothing was ever too much trouble and they were always very quick to respond to any queries we had.
The staff at The White Hart are amazing and made me feel very calm and comfortable while getting ready for our big day in the amazing bridal getting ready room, which was one of the highlights of the day as there is so much space for everyone with make-up artists and hair stylists etc meaning there was zero stress.
The food was great all round, we had a meal the night before, the wedding breakfast and breakfast the day after were all just amazing, cannot fault anything with it.
Honestly the best day of our lives, so glad we choose this venue to get married, we would highly recommend to all!!"
V413,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"From the moment we booked our wedding at The White Hart, Laura was nothing short of exceptional. She not only helped us arrange every detail but also provided us with fantastic recommendations for photographers, entertainment, transport options, and venue decorators. Her communication was always swift and thorough, and she answered every question we had, making the entire process seamless from start to finish.

On the wedding day, our heartfelt thanks go to the wedding coordinators, Vicky and Amy who ensured everything ran smoothly and took the time to review every minute final detail with us a week before the big day. They managed every aspect of the day from start to finish, making sure everything was perfect. They both, along with their staff assisted guests with check-ins and helped (early - considering a late finish) with breakfast the following morning—going above and beyond in every way.

Thank you also to Luke and Bradley, for their incredible support. Luke, in particular, made my wife feel like the most important person on the planet. His care and attention was extraordinary, making my wife feel like she was the only bride to have ever gotten married at The White Hart. For also, calming me on my walk up to the venue, thank you. The personal touch he added to the day for us both made it truly unforgettable.

I’d also like to offer a special thank you to Vicky, who provided me with much-needed emotional support on the morning of the wedding. She was there to reassure me, address my concerns, and help calm my nerves—exactly what I needed before greeting guests, sat anxiously waiting for my arrival followed by my Niamh's arrival.

As someone who was feeling a little anxious leading up to the day, I couldn’t have asked for a better team of professionals. With them running everything, we were in great hands. Our wedding day ran exactly how we envisioned it, and it was nothing short of perfect! From the management to the chefs and waitstaff, every detail was thoughtfully taken care of, and it was the most magical day of our lives.

A huge thank you to the entire team for making our day not only flawless but incredibly special. We truly couldn’t have asked for more & we will regularly visit for a the extraordinary food and drink on offer.

All our love & support,

Ryan & Niamh X"
V413,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"We had our twighlight wedding on 19 October 24 and everything about it was perfect and magical. The staff were fantastic in terms of planning and on the day, nothing was too much trouble, particular mention for Laura, Vicki and Amy 😊"
V413,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"We just had our wedding day at The White Hart and all I can say is EXCEPTIONAL! from the day we booked Laura was always on hand to help us and answer any questions we had about our day or the venue. So attentive she even worked late to help us secure a new DJ after issues with our original one. She went above and beyond through the whole planning process. She is a calming influence and incredibly organised and professional which is just what you need when planning a wedding. OUTSTANDING SERVICE! Additionally the front of house staff on the day were all incredible and made everything run seamlessly throughout the day and late into the night. Vicky and Amy, you two were amazing! We can’t thank you enough for making it even more perfect than either of us could have imagined. You are all superhero’s and I’m so impressed that even the tiniest of details and planning were followed exactly as I had asked. I can’t thank you all enough. If you are planning to get married and want the confidence of knowing your venue and it’s staff have your back and will make your day exactly how you picture it then look no further than The White Hart! Best venue ever! ❤️❤️❤️"
V413,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"Got Married in July 2024, from start to finish Laura our wedding day coordinator was amazing with fantastic attention to detail, our day went so smoothly with Amy and Viki as our wedding day managers, all of our guest raved about all three courses.
The grounds were absolutely stunning for our photos along with there five star accommodation,

Well done white hart team for making our day so special , we can’t wait to celebrate our anniversary with you!
⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
V413,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"Our wedding was brought together with the expertise of Abbi, Laura & the whole white Hart team. The day ran so smoothly and everything was on point like clockwork! They helped answering any questions we had and went the extra mile when needed. If we could we would get married here all over again-fab venue and value for money!"
V413,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"The Barn at the White Hart is amazing, a beautiful setting and welcoming environment. The process was easy and they were patient with me and my many questions. The meetings were eye opening for details we had never even thought about, but so worth it!

The wedding itself was more than we could have ever dreamed of, everything ran so smoothly! This meant that we could enjoy ourselves and not worry about anything, the team had everything we needed and were so accommodating.

Everyone commented on how much they enjoyed themselves and all were amazed by the food, it was as good as it always is.

We cannot thank everyone at the White Hart enough!"
V413,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"There wasn't a moment during our planning with the White Hart, or the day itself where we didn't feel cared for. Originally, we chose to view it as thank to its website we knew it welcomed LGBT couples. From our first meeting. we were made welcome and everything was done to make sure neither one of us were sacrificing just because there were two brides!
The barn was perfect and the suggested DJ is phenomenal and great at reading a room. Even though it rained, there was no impact on the day. The staff were flexible, attentive and (most importantly as two ex-service workers!) everyone seemed to really like being there. We had complex dietary requirements with some guests and these were addressed brilliantly, with these guests getting personalised menus. There were also perfect vegetarian and vegan options. The guests in question went out of their way to thank us for their lovely menu, and none of them were treated any differently.

The biggest thank you to Laura and Abby for planning and managing the day. You were fantastic. An extra shout out to Josephine, who was a delight the whole time we were there and was the friendliest face as I walked over to meet the registrars."
V413,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"Lovely place, just perfect with lovely Barn an pub on the side, accommodation on site was just superb. Laura and Abi made all planing so easy and helped us to have perfect day"
V413,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"I could not recommend the White Hart more as a venue.
Laura and her team were professional and attentive throughout the entire wedding planning process, and will be as involved as you want or need them to be. Nothing is too much trouble for them.

The venue itself is beautiful, in a peaceful country setting, we loved it from our first visit. The mezzanine floor was something I'd never seen before at a venue, and I really felt it added something different and alternative to the venue, plus meant that if the weather took a turn for the worse, (which we were lucky to avoid on our day!) you or your guests won't get wet moving from ceremony to reception!

The bridal preparation suite is also beautiful and spacious enough for all you need in the morning, plus a view out over the front of the Inn where you can see your guests arriving!

Our guests have all commented on how lovely the venue is, as well as the gorgeous accommodation and amazing food. We are looking forward to returning for dinner or even to stay in one of the beautiful rooms.

We highly recommend the White Hart, the service is second to none, and the Wedding package prices are really competitive, we didn't have a huge budget but still managed to afford all we needed and wanted."
V414,The Lawn,"We had a really beautiful wedding day at The Lawn. The experienced team were very helpful with the planning and professional throughout, taking any potential stress out of the day so that we could relax and fully enjoy our special day. Everything went as planned, including the weather allowing us to get married outside in the very pretty gazebo (there was a great back-up plan in case of rain so we didn't have to worry!). Our 60 day guests enjoyed a three course meal which was of great quality; we had many compliments about the food and service, including the evening buffet for 110 guests. The Lawn is a fantastic setting for a wedding, coupled with great service, that we would thoroughly recommend."
V414,The Lawn,"I cannot express the gratitude I have for The Lawn. We had our day on the 25th May 2024 and from start to finish the staff were amazing.

The food was stunning! The venue itself is absolutely breathtaking. Thank you so much for making our day what it was… perfect. I could not recommend this venue enough."
V414,The Lawn,"Where to start? From beginning to end, The Lawn were the perfect venue choice! Not just because of the stunning house and gardens, but because David and the team made every step as stress-free and enjoyable as possible (even with all the questions we kept pinging them). We knew before we visited that The Lawn was the venue for us, to the point we booked then and there! We had absolutely no worries leading up to the day about how things were going to run and throughout the day there was always someone on hand (and with a smile). Honestly, words cannot express how wonderful our day was - utterly perfect! Thank you for everything!"
V414,The Lawn,"We were married in September 2023 and had our reception at the lawn. As it was an African-British wedding, we had many requests which the team at the Lawn really helped with. As we had exclusive use, the bridal party could get dressed at the Lawn before heading to Church and the parking was great for our guests travelling from long distances. Guests loved the horses and grounds. They particularly commented on being well catered for. It was a perfect day!"
V414,The Lawn,"The team at The Lawn helped us to host the perfect wedding. The amount of effort, thought and care that went into supporting us and everything we needed to make the day a success is amazing, this is possibly the first family event we’ve hosted where we have not felt the need to stress over a severe anaphylactic reaction.

From the minute we met we both felt at ease and confident our day would run smoothly, no question or request was too large.
They went above and beyond for us and it was truly appreciated, everyone has commented on the beauty of the venue as well as how smoothly and effortless the day ran.

We would honestly recommend the lawn for anyone looking for a venue to host a celebration - the venue is beautiful and the staff are absolutely amazing."
V414,The Lawn,The best day ever!!! Couldn’t of been any better thank you so much!! All the staff were fab and so so helpful nothing was ever to much hassle. Felt like one big family will be forever grateful!! Love chelsea and sam xx
V414,The Lawn,"Where do I start, we cannot thank you enough for hosting our wedding on Saturday. Your staff were fantastic and the whole day could not have gone any better.
I always knew I wanted to get married at the lawn as my own parents married here 24 years ago, I was 12 years old. 4 years later Matt and I got together and finally after 20 years we had our own special day at the lawn.

Everything from the planning beforehand, adapting the menus so everyone could eat the same including anyone with dietary requirements to how everything kept to schedule.
I was an emotional wreck most of the morning getting ready but you made sure I did not have to worry about anything downstairs and when I finally got to see everything I was blown away.

A special thank you to David, Michael and Lizzie. You are brilliant at what you do.

The caterers and waiting staff were amazing. The food came out all at the same time, was hot and extremely tasty. The staff serving were so kind and accommodating.

This day was long overdue but we were lucky our children got to share it with us like I got to with my parents and you all made it the best day which we will never ever forget. My parents said the high standards you set on Saturday was exactly the same when they got married and it really is the best place to get married so anyone looking for a place to have their wedding and reception book in quick you will not be disappointed.

Thank you again
Jade and Matthew.
Finally Mr & Mrs Judge xxx"
V414,The Lawn,"Wow! What can we say? A perfect day was had at the Lawn, with superb organisation, friendly staff and a beutiful building!"
V414,The Lawn,"We would just like to say a massive thank you for making our twilight
wedding such a magical experience for both of us.

From your patience in answering all our questions leading up to the day to
your almost fanatical weather watching all afternoon (who knew there were so
many apps?! ) and then your ability to switch everything to outside at the
eleventh hour to ensure we could have the service in your beautiful gazebo
just made the perfect start to an amazing evening and the start of our
married life.

Thank you again so much and we send our warmest wishes to you all"
V414,The Lawn,"The whole team did everything to make our day so special. Unfortunately the English weather didn't play ball with us, but it didn't affect the day at all. Everyone was so helpful and the day ran so smoothly. We just wish we could do it all again! Would recommend as a wedding venue!"
V415,Gosfield Hall,"I never imagined my wedding would be somewhere as stunning as Gosfield hall but from the minute we saw this venue we knew it was the one for us and didn't bother viewing anymore venues as we had already made our minds up about having our wedding here! We were absolutely blown away with the natural beauty of Gosfield hall and so booked two years in advance of our wedding day! The professionalism and advice we received from Linda was super helpful and informative on the run up to our wedding as there is soo much to think about! We loved that we could have our day and evening all in one place aswell as the option weather permitting to have our wedding ceremony outside. I'm pleased to say the weather was absolutely perfect on our wedding day and we got to have our fairytale wedding outside! The package we paid for was well worth the money! Our guests were absolutely spoilt on our day and have all said it was the best wedding they've ever been too! It was amazing to have our guests stay over aswell! Jocie our wedding planner was absolutely amazing! She was sooo friendly and super accommodating and went above and beyond on our day to make it absolutely perfect with no hiccups! She even helped dress me on the day as she knew how to do up a corset dress and my mother didn't have a clue lol she made all my wedding details and decorations come to life and done such a stunning job decorating our dream venue aswell as being super supportive towards me my family and guests! The honeymoon suite is the best we've ever seen and completely took ours and our guests breaths away! Mind blowing! The food,venue,grounds,accomodation and night before accomodation were absolutely stunning and we want to thank everyone at Gosfield hall for making our day soo incredible and special and a day we and our guests will never forget! We can't wait to return to Gosfield! Thank you everyone at Gosfield what an amazing place!"
V415,Gosfield Hall,"We had previously experienced Gosfield Hall as a guest before deciding on it for our anniversary.

Our day was beautiful and went according to plan. Our guests all had great feedback about the day.

The only thing we would have changed would have been more diverse menu for the main meals."
V415,Gosfield Hall,"Gosfield hall is a beautiful location for a wedding and their packages cover all the important stuff! We didn’t have to worry about caterers, wedding coordinator or a DJ - all included! Great service, lovely food and everyone really enjoyed the day! Our coordinator Jocie was fab on the day, getting everything organised and fetching anything we needed. Couldn’t have asked for better, she knew the time line and the day flowed really smoothly!"
V415,Gosfield Hall,"We got married at Gosfield Hall and everything about it was perfect from when we arrive to view it, booking, the communication and Faye Carter our wedding Coordinator! If you want the best wedding day with no hassle, Gosfield is your place!!"
V415,Gosfield Hall,"Myself and my Wife have just got married at Gosfield Hall,
Our expensive started when we viewed the venue and we first met Linda sales manager, she welcome us in & made us feel at home, we wasn’t sure how, but she made us feel calm like this was where we was meant to be.
Once we looked around at all the venue has to offer we had already made a decision as this is such a stunning location and instantly new this was what we wanted! It was just right for us.

We did not get made to feel pressured to make any decisions immediately however we did end up booking our big say within the next few days after our visit.

Our next contact was with Ellie our wedding planner, she was very helpful and nothing was ever to much, we enjoyed the food tasting at the venue and was very impressed with the experience, it was out of this world.
Ellie helped us through all of our problems and made sure all of our plans come to life.

Now on our big day, what can I say? The staff were amazing, Ellie couldn’t have done enough every time you wanted to ask a question she was next to us any time we needed something. She was there all the way through the day/ night & even the next morning, Ellie made our day Run seamlessly.
We’ve been to many weddings before but never have we had food as amazing as we did here.
Every guest was amazed at the food quality and commented on how delicious it was!
Just to sum up if you’re thinking about booking your wedding at Gosfield Hall don’t question it just book it. You will be amazed."
V415,Gosfield Hall,"The venue is stunning and was the perfect setting for our winter wedding (so much natural light even in January). Jocie Golbourn was our assigned wedding planning specialist and she is so kind, sweet, patient and professional. All our guests loved the venue but many actually commented on how flawless and seamless the day was organised and rooms decorated and prepared from each section of the wedding and we only have Jocie and venue staff to thank for their meticulous planning and preparations. The food and drinks were delicious. Couldn’t recommend this venue enough- we actually booked the venue on a whim and were SO happy when we visited for an open day. There’s no false advertisements- it’s stunning."
V415,Gosfield Hall,"Everything, from start to finish, was exactly what we wanted and more. The preparation was helped by our wonderful personal manager, Tara, and accommodated each and every one of our requests and needs. The venue is gorgeous, food delicious, and atmosphere felt special. Our friends and family all told us that this was such a spectacular wedding for them that it was the best they've ever been to. We felt completely taken care of, kept us calm and happy throughout the day, and kept all of our suppliers in place and to standard. It felt glamourous and unique. We wish we could relive the day over and over. It really was our dream wedding."
V415,Gosfield Hall,"We got married in Gosfield Hall in May and had the most amazing wedding day that any couple could ask for. The whole experience from the arrival the night before to leaving the day after was seamlessly managed by the team at the venue.
The house and the grounds looked absolutely stunning and Ellie and the team did a brilliant job at keeping the day running smoothly without making anyone feel rushed. Everyone there was immensely friendly and helpful and we really felt that everyone who worked there was invested in making our day feel special.
We fell in love with the venue when we booked it but the whole experience exceeded out expectations so much that we wish we could do it all again!"
V415,Gosfield Hall,"I wanted to take a moment to commend and state our appreciation for Jocie. She truly was phenomenal, approachable and no task was too big.
We had 5 months to plan our wedding and we loved every moment. With us both working in the service industry it was great to have someone who was so switched on and would be an asset to have on any team."
V415,Gosfield Hall,"Having just got married at Gosfield Hall I can honestly say it was the most beautiful venue and the most perfect day. The staff were so attentive and professional. The food was outstanding and the drinks and cocktails were fabulous. They couldn’t do enough to make sure our day was everything we’d dreamt of. I have to say a special thanks to Ellie - one of the wedding coordinators on site - she went above and beyond to help us plan our day and was there from the very moment I woke up delivering fresh pastries for breakfast to the moment she made me a cup of tea to go to bed with. I can’t thank you enough Ellie, you are an absolute credit to Gosfield Hall."

V417,Leez Priory,"I never in my life thought I would get married in a place like Leez priory! The whole experience from start to finish was just fantastic. The price breakdown was manageable and there was no pressure to take any upgrades offered. The things we got in our package were phenomenal and having a wedding planner was tremendous - our lady (Leanne) was an absolute god send!
They catered to all our needs and we were made to feel so comfortable and nothing was a problem! I’d highly suggest going to an event there before hand, just to get a feel of what it’s like full of people and enjoy their delicious food. We actually enjoyed their entertainer ( singer) so much we hired him for our wedding ☺️
Lee priory is just so beautiful. I can’t speak highly enough x"
V417,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory on the 7th of September 2024. Considering how long they have been a wedding venue, they were pretty flexible with some of the ideas we had for the venue styling that turned out amazingly!

The staff really made the day something special and couldn't have done enough for us. Special mention must be made for Leanne, our wedding planner, who was amazing!

Highly recommend the venue and the incredible team that helped to make our day so special!"
V417,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in October 2024. This venue is stunning both inside and out with immaculately kept grounds and interior. The hospitality in the lead up to and on the day of the wedding was fantastic. The food was also brilliant. Another great perk of this venue is the amount of on site accommodation.

A couple of drawbacks / experiences during our wedding. There are only a few toilets in the main building which kept blocking and overflowing throughout the evening which led to us taking some guests to the dressing room or honeymoon cottage to use the facilities. You are also restricted by the venue on any external food or drink suppliers and the venues optional extras for this are quite expensive for what they are.

That asaide, we had the best day and evening at Leez Priory and would certainly recommend it!"
V417,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in August 2024- great venue and experience from initial viewing to leaving the morning after the wedding. Leanne acted as our wedding planner and was friendly, professional and helpful throughout. We opted for the classic package and the food was amazing quality with everyone commenting how full they were!
The venue is beautiful with several options for ceremony both inside and out. Accommodation was great too. The whole day ran smoothly with perfect weather - we will have very happy memories of our day!"
V417,Leez Priory,"Perfect venue and very attentive staff, lovely food and great communication from start to finish"
V417,Leez Priory,"Stunning venue. Fantastic Team. Very accommodating toward our unique ""surprise"" strategy. Our guests were truly surprised. Thank you."
V417,Leez Priory,"Leez priory was the 1st and only venue we looked around when we started planning our wedding. From the moment we stepped on the premises, everything just looked so perfect and exactly what we wanted from a wedding venue. When we got assigned our wedding co-ordinator Rachel, she was just absolutely spot on with everything we asked for and nothing was too big an ask for her. She made sure the day ran as smoothly as possible and took care of any issue that arose without me knowing (which I am forever grateful for!!)
The rest of the staff were amazing and very helpful.

The venue itself is just absolutely stunning and we loved that it has the pub area as well as the dance floor so it catered to all of our guests.

All of the rooms were lovely and it was so nice being able to stay in the fisherman’s lodge onsite the night before the wedding.

We genuinely cannot recommend this venue enough and it was 100% worth the money! 10/10!"
V417,Leez Priory,"We got married on a Tuesday in October to maximise the value of what we could get for our money; and honestly, we got everything we wanted and more. Leanne, our Wedding Manager was perfect at bringing an attention to detail and seamless organisation to the big day, and in the lead up. There wasn't one moment of the day where we felt stressed, as Leanne had it covered. In one particular instance, our flowers for the bridal party's hair hadn't arrived. Within five minutes of telling Leanne that we needed this, the flowers were with our hair and make-up suppliers to add the finishing touches.

Leez Priory as a venue is the most stunning setting, and offers an incredible range of areas in which the ceremony and reception can take place. There is also the opportunity for the bridal party to make use of the Fisherman's Cottage the night before the wedding, and for people to stay in the on-site accommodation on the evening of the wedding, making it the perfect venue for people also travelling from further afield.

Leez Priory were very accommodating, welcoming and were happy to work with us to make our day as perfect as possible. The food was incredible, and a total hit with all of our guests, and so many people have commented on how incredible the day was as a whole. You wouldn't be disappointed to choose Leez Priory."
V417,Leez Priory,They catered to our every need. To when we would ask for things they hadn’t been done before they still made sure it went smoothly. Leanne was amazing she made me feel so comfortable from the start. The whole day was stunning. Beautiful venue please go view it as you will not be disappointed
V417,Leez Priory,We got married on the 26 May 2024. This venue was absolutely brilliant! They catered for every need and made sure there was no stress on the day. Leanne was kind and level headed throughout and was always one step ahead! Do not hesitate to book- do it now!
V418,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"Best day of our lives!

The Roslin wedding experience was absolutely flawless from the first meeting we had to the day after our most special wedding day!

Amy and Evan were so supportive and understanding throughout the whole planning experience. They both made us feel so special.

Stefan was exceptional on our wedding day, keeping the day running smoothly and meaning that we could both enjoy the day ourselves without having to worry.

We have had so many people say it was the best wedding they have ever been to. The food was just perfect.

Garry, the DJ was a really nice guy and the dance floor was full all night. Thank you so much Garry!

The bridal suite is absolutely perfect. So many beautiful little touches. The stay was wonderful for all of our guests and the breakfast was outstanding. Even the ladies on the checkout desk made us feel special.

Thank you so much to everyone at the Roslin for making our wedding day so perfect and run so smoothly!

Lots of love,
Mr & Mrs Pope x"
V418,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"Thank you so much for all you have done to make our wedding so perfect.
From the very beginning the team have been communicative and friendly. Very quick replies to emails and quick to answer questions with helpful advice and tips.
On the day the team ensured that everything ran as smoothly as possible. The food was incredible and we have received many compliments regarding the catering team.
The team were both professional and friendly and nothing was too much trouble.
Our stay overnight was in a gorgeous room with a beautiful view.
Breakfast in the morning was delicious.
Thank you again."
V418,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"Well, Amy and the team - what can we say?? Our day was absolute perfection. Here are some things we would like to comment on to demonstrate just how amazing the day was:
Ceremony - complete attention to detail - we were not going to have a signing table as we had legally married the day before - Amy was honest and said the room would look bare and she was absolutely right - so glad we decided to listen to Amy's advice. The room was decorated stunningly - there was such attention to detail - extras of our flowers were placed tastefully in vases around the room, there were lanterns and candles that we had not asked for but made the room look more finished. There were extra centre pieces we had provided - these were placed in different areas to compliment the theme.
Bridal party arrival - upon arrival there was a complimentary bottle of prosecco for the party in the bridal suite. The suite was beautiful and our bouquets were laid out so nicely for us. We asked for some more champagne flutes and straight away, within 2 mins there were some at our door.
En route to the ceremony I was worried about the song and when everyone had to walk in - why I was worried I do not know as Amy had listened to it numerous times and knew exactly when to send everyone in. Amy and Evan even sorted out my dress so it looked beautiful walking down the aisle.
Throughout the ceremony the team had tidied the bridal suite room and put chocolates and petals on the bed. When I went to show my husband the suite, I had warned him that it had been a bit of a mess - but no - Amy and the team had ensured it looked almost as if noone had been there!
Drinks reception - we went for photos on the beach and whilst this was happening there was canapes and prosecco - at previous weddings people had commented that they (as bride and groom) had not had the opportunity to try their canapes as they had been doing photos - but the team had thought of this and Tate brought us out our own little plate with 2 of each canapes each.
The change over was swift and the room looked fabulous for dinner thanks for Evan and her guidance - Amy had suggested having a smaller number of tables and more people on each otherwise the tables would look bare - again absolutely the right decision. We had some elderly guests and while the change over was happening they were given chairs to sit on which was no drama whatsoever for the staff.
The meal - everyone raved about the food - it was sublime - presented so tastefully and portions were generous. It was a really lovely touch that Tate went around and asked every single table, not just the top table, how their food was. This was great as I have never seen this at a wedding before.
Again, turnaround for the evening was flawless and the ballroom looked beautiful.
Other things that made our day extra special - everyone who was part of the wedding party received room upgrades free of charge which really made everyone feel special; we didnt have time to try our cake, but the team had realised this would be the case and on arrival to the bridal suite after the evening there was two slices of cake presented beautifully with some of the left over flowers, as well as our gifts and cards and the left over drinks from dinner service. Nothing went to waste as the bottles of wine that were not used at dinner were left on the bar for guests to enjoy in the evening too.
We cannot fault the service or staff at the Roslin at all.
A few special mentions -
Nicky behind the bar - you are a wonderful woman and made sure nothing was too much - you made drinks with love and were a real hit with the guests, everyone said how wonderful you were. Thank you for being great.
Tate - wow - you were so calm and collected - if we wanted 5 mins to ourselves that was not an issue - nothing was too much to ask. You ensured the day ran smoothly (we were always on time throughout the day) and you ensured that everyone was well looked after. Thank you - you are fantastic at your job.
Evan - You ensured the turn around of the room was done quickly but with class and flawlessly finished. Thank you.
Amy - what can we say - your team are an absolute credit to you, and it is because of you that we had a wedding that was more than we ever could have dreamed of. Your operations runs like a well-oiled machine but at the same time ensures the authenticity and personalism of every single wedding, to ensure it retains it individuality. Some weddings have felt like 'conveyer belts' but every single person spoke so highly of you, the team and the venue. Thank you endlessly for your love and dedication to what you do. It is very evident.
One small thing - oh... who are we kidding! The day was the most perfect experience. We will treasure The Roslin and our treatment as bride and groom forever. You are wonderful people, great value for money as a venue and you will always hold a special place in our heart. Thank you. Mr and Mrs Lee"
V418,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"Where to begin…. If anyone is thinking of having a wedding here, DO IT! The most stress free and lovable venue we could have asked for, Special thanks to Evan and Amy were incredible leading up to and on the day! The venue is stunning, the food was sooo goood, and the staff were fantastic!
Magical!!
Many Thanks, Nathan!"
V418,The Roslin Beach Hotel,Brilliantly done. Being so busy I wanted a venue that would just get it done. They did that and did it perfectly!!! Everyone commented on the brilliance of the Roslin!
V418,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"Thank you for all your hard work to make our day extra special and run so smoothly. We were both so relaxed the whole day, enjoying every moment. Amy is truly amazing at her job and just get 'it', she saw our vision and made it come to life. People complimented on the day and the Roslin team are at the top of their game."
V418,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"A very big heartfelt thank you for all your help and guidance, assistance and planning on our wedding day along with the lead up to it.

A special mention goes to our events manager Amy, you were a godsend from start to finish, thank you so much for your perfect organisation skills and helping run the wedding morning so calmly. Zed & Tate - thank you for all of your help and co-ordination during our wedding, evening and Sunday celebrations.

V418,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"We can’t thank Roslin Beach Hotel enough for all of their help, everything went so smoothly and Amy helped us all to stay so calm!! We had such an amazing day and all of the members of staff could not do enough for all of us , the service was impeccable!! Couldn’t have asked for a better venue , the food was amazing and We were treated so well. Thanks again for all of your kindness , Amy and her team really made our day PERFECT !!"
V418,The Roslin Beach Hotel,Thank you so much to all management and staff for making my daughter and son-in-law's wedding day so special on 1st June. All your hard work and dedication showed through on the day. Thank you once again!
V418,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"We would like to say a big thank you to you and all the Roslin staff for making Ruth & Kelly's Wedding such a wonderful memorable day. Attention to detail was first class. DJ, flowers, the food, the waiting staff, in fact, the whole package couldn't have been better. Our guests were full of praise for this exceptional venue."
V419,Wivenhoe House,"we had a summer wedding July 2022. we had a garden ceremony.

from the day of enquiry to the day of the wedding, the team were fantastic, nothing was a problem, they were so willing to arrange, or sort out everytging.
We originally booked during covid but dates were moved due to health reasons, the team were more than happy to assist
they are great for advice and guidance for recommendations of suppliers that are loyal to them and reasonably priced also.

they were especially kind to my father who is in a wheelchair paralysed, Lionel one of the management team made sure a member of staff was always on hand helping him, to make the day as stress free for both of my parents, from the day before when they arrived to the moment they left with their luggage.
Lionel also organised the party of 20+ guests (including children) staying the night before the wedding the marquee for us all to have our evening meal together next to the restaurant, which was so kind.

the groom and i got ready separately in different areas of the hotel. i had a bridal team of 10 as did he, the wivenhoe team, were there continuously helping assisting and asking if we needed anything,

i had a particular set up of my décor for my tables, sweet cart etc, and lisa the events manager knew exactly my style and had it done perfectly. she was there early before she was expected helping and organising going above and beyond what she was needed to do, to make our day perfect.

the food was amazing, we had cocktails, canapes, wedding breakfast and the evening buffet, everyone was impressed with the high standard of food and service. (especially the guests who had special dietary requirements, who were very well looked after and felt like VIP’s)

lisa was a rock to us she was always there wherever i needed her, and she made our day flawless and perfect!

the reception team, were a great help, we had 20 rooms booked in the end, and i was constantly emailing for adding more and having a spreadsheet of who has booked etc.

the management team and the staff are wonderful
if we could afford it we would do it all over again a heartbeat! Was the happiest day of our lives, never stopped smiling or laughing x"
V419,Wivenhoe House,"From the initial meeting through to the day of our wedding Louise and Phoebe were excellent.
Nothing was too much trouble.
In the day of the wedding they dressed the venue to the highest standard and were so attentive, even helping my daughter when her speech became so emotional.
I cannot rate them high enough.
Stunning venue with the highest level of service.
Price was reasonable with so many extras included saving the stress of sorting discos and catering.
1000% the best choice we made.
Thank you Wivenhoe house for making our dream wedding come true."
V419,Wivenhoe House,"The Wivenhoe House Hotel, Colchester.
The whole experience from beginning to end was faultless.
Perfect day."
V419,Wivenhoe House,"Our wedding at wivenhoe house was everything we dreamed of!. The setting is beautiful and our wedding coordinator lisa, was just perfect. Price was very reasonable too! Amazing food and service :)"
V419,Wivenhoe House,"The wedding couldn’t have gone anymore amazing thanks to the team at Wivenhoe house. We was meant to get married in 2020, then 2021 and finally managed 2022. This was with massive support from the team also. The day went so amazing as they all went above and beyond for us."
V419,Wivenhoe House,"We got married nearly a year ago now 1/11/2019.
Wivenhoe house is truest beautiful and it I feel should be higher on people’s list for a wedding venue. The house is beautiful and I loved my wedding day. Katie was perfect as a planner and listened to us completely even my husbands idea of llamas!! Which we didn’t follow through with. The price was amazing for what we got included!!
The food was so great!! Especially the pudding and the evening buffet was the best I’d seen for the amount and selection. Would highly recommend the sliders. Overall I would give 10/10."
V419,Wivenhoe House,"I enjoyed most of it my wedding coordinator done well as well with all staff, room are clean decoration was lovely ,stunning areas ,food for my wedding breakfast is delicious all our guest ? love it ,we look after properly I highly recommend Wivenhoe house for wedding ."
V419,Wivenhoe House,Thank you so much for all your help in arranging our beautiful wedding reception. Everybody loved the day and we’re very impressed with your staff. They were attentive and approachable. We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Wivenhoe House to friends and family. We couldn’t be happier. The food was beautiful. We wish you all the best and thank you for all your patience. Hope to see you all again in the future.
V419,Wivenhoe House,"My husband and I got married here on the 30th June. We honestly couldn't have picked a better venue. We first visited this venue on a wedding open evening that they had, and it was incredibly busy. Yet, there was a member of staff on hand that could help and attend any questions/queries that we had. I'd spent a year planning our wedding, mainly with Katie Ballard. Her help and knowledge of wedding planning really was second to none. I'd never planned a wedding before so all of her help and guidance was very much appreciated. I had many visits to WHH throughout the year and each member of staff honestly couldn't do more for you. We did a menu tasting for our wedding day and was assisted by Ellie in the Brasserie. Her knowledge on all of the food options available was very impressive. The food was outstanding, we had 3 courses and 4 different dishes and each one was cooked and served to perfection. It's safe to say that Our wedding day was more than I could ever had imagined. It truly was perfect in every way and ran incredibly smoothly. Our guests also found the staff to be incredibly helpful and attentive, as they were helped with luggage, and allowing a few guests into their rooms a little earlier. I honestly couldn't recommend this venue enough. The house and grounds are breathtaking. And the staff are truly what make it the most wonderful, memorable experience."
V419,Wivenhoe House,"We booked Wivenhoe house bout a year before the wedding, we had amazing service from start to finish! Louise was responsive to all emails and incredibly helpful in sorting out all of the final details.

The day ran incredibly smoothly, all of the staff were fantastic."
V420,Stock Brook Country Club,We fell in love when we saw the venue for the very first time. It's beautiful and you can really go to town with decorations or keep it as simple as you like. The venue looked even better than I had pictured on my wedding day. We got so many compliments about the canapés and food at the wedding day as well. The only disappointing thing I found was that we couldn't access the bridal suite to get ready until 11am which is in the courtyard and where you can get amazing pictures. We had to start getting ready in a hotel nearby and then move there which was extremely stressful I begged Stock Brook to provide us with another room or access from 10 as that would've worked for us but they wasn't helpful at all if I'm honest. It's something I never really thought of until you are arranging timings for hair and make up etc and most people can access their prep room a lot earlier but the rest of the day made up for this and I really did have the best day.
V420,Stock Brook Country Club,"This venue was everything we had ever dreamed of and more. The venue is stunning and the space perfect. We got married in the rosewood suite which is a lovely long aisle to walk down, had the reception drinks in the gardens which was stunning and perfect for a hot sunny day. Our evening was upstairs in the ballroom and this was the whole reason we chose this venue. The space is perfect and the dance floor and glitter ball is so pretty. With the help of our venue decorator this room was breathtaking.

From start to finish our wedding co ordinator was on hand to answer any questions we had and helped us to ensure our day was perfect."
V420,Stock Brook Country Club,My husband and I booked our wedding with Stock Brook Manor in early 2019. I want to mention Joe who was our planner and contact at Stock Brook. He helped us plan a big wedding and then COVID happened. Joe helped us plan a smaller wedding and genuinely his help was invaluable. We are so thankful to Joe for working with us to make our day perfect. I would recommend Stock Brook Manor. Beautiful venue and amazing service from Joe and the other staff who work hard and are so friendly.
V420,Stock Brook Country Club,"We had the most fabulous day, Stock Brook is the best and most perfect wedding venue in the area. The venue speaks for itself and the food, service and wedding planning support are as brilliant. As a PA who is usually the bossy organiser, it was apparent from the outset that the team there have everything running perfectly so I felt more than happy taking a step back and concentrate on other areas of the wedding. I cannot thank the team including firstly Joe and then in the main Eleanor for everything they did. I couldn’t have dreamed of a better day."
V420,Stock Brook Country Club,"My husband and I got married at Stockbrook at the weekend, and had an absolutely fantastic day. All the staff from the cleaners to the waiting and bar staff were fantastic and work so hard to make it a perfect day. A particular mention to Joe Howgate who ensured everything on the day was perfect (which is no easy task with me being such a perfectionist). The food was amazing, and we had several comments that it was the best food people had tasted at a wedding. Overall, it was a fantastic day, thank you to all the staff, you’re AMAZING!! We will never forget our wonderful day!"
V420,Stock Brook Country Club,"From start to finish, everyone was great. Eleanor Pitts was our event planner, she went above and beyond at every opportunity. She helped us with the finer details that I wouldn't have even thought of. Venue was stunning, I wasn't aware of any faults, if there was any, we didn't have a clue. Eleanor helped make the day perfect, thank you sooo much."
V420,Stock Brook Country Club,"On our initial visit to Stockbrook Manor we instantly fell I love with the venue.
Joe, our coordinator was amazing throughout from when we had our initial planning meeting all the way to our final meeting. He was extremely thorough, patient & organised which really put our minds at ease.
Brides please bear with Joe as there were some periods of radio silence towards the wedding but this was due to the fact that Joe had a large number of weddings to coordinate. On our wedding day Joe was amazing, he knew our day like the back of his hand which really made the day perfect.
All our guests haven't stopped commenting on our wedding day, from the canapes to drinks, to the food and evening food! Guests who stayed at great blunts and the stables loved the accommodation. Thanks to all the staff at Stockbrook and especially Joe who we feel blessed to have as our coordinator.

From

The Frasers"
V420,Stock Brook Country Club,"It's versatility, the size, the use of both outdoor and indoor space and the decor (of both the venue plus the stunning Great Blunts House accommodation). We were also really impressed with the added extras that were included in the wedding package. We also really appreciated how flexible and open minded you were with our ideas with regards to themes and how we wanted the set up. The operation of the day couldn't have gone any better. You delivered everything we had planned and you didn't let me down in any aspect. One of my aunties was so happy with the quality of the food she wanted to thank the chef in person. Best wishes to you and all the fantastic team at Stock Brook."
V420,Stock Brook Country Club,"A massive thank you to all staff at Stock Brook Country Club for helping us bring our magical wedding day together! In particular Eleanor who has helped guide and accomodate us with all our planning and making our journey a smooth one! The venue itself is beautiful and spacious and looked elegant on the day thanks to Sophie, and her beautiful decorations. The guests enjoyed the food, drink and in particular spoke very highly of the stables accommodation we stayed at. We could not have asked for more and very pleased x"
V420,Stock Brook Country Club,"We would just like to say a massive thank you. From the minute we met you, we knew you had got this! From the bottom of our hearts it was truly the best day of our lives! All our guests haven't stopped commenting on our wedding day, from the canapes to drinks, to the food and evening food! Our guests said it's the best wedding food they have ever had. You made sure everthing was perfect for us. We can't thank you enough."
V421,Vaulty Manor,"Beautiful venue, lovely staff! Thank you for a wonderful day.
5 * service!"
V421,Vaulty Manor,"Beautiful day, thank you to the whole team for everything. Stunning venue and the staff were amazing. Everything ran smoothly and the whole wedding was better than we could have ever dreamt of. Thanks a million, it was a great day that we will remember for the rest of our lives."
V421,Vaulty Manor,"Very good day overall, everything went according to plan, food was lovely and staff friendly too."
V421,Vaulty Manor,"Wonderful wedding, thank you so much. The food was amazing and all help with the planning was great."
V421,Vaulty Manor,"Wonderful wedding, thank you so much. The food was amazing and all help with the planning was great."
V421,Vaulty Manor,Great professional and lovely staff. Food was delicious. Would highly recommend Vaulty Manor to anyone looking for a venue.
V421,Vaulty Manor,"Beautiful ceremony, gorgeous grounds and buildings. Staff worked extremely hard which helped make the day so wonderful."
V421,Vaulty Manor,"Staff were attentive and polite, rooms were very nice and breakfast the morning after was just right. Lovely venue."
V421,Vaulty Manor,"Very well hosted by the staff, would highly recommend this fantastic venue."
V421,Vaulty Manor,"Great food and staff, the venue is lovely and the bright sunshine made it even more special"
V422,Hutton Hall,"I just wanted to express my deepest gratitude to you both, and your amazing team of staff. From the day we booked, to enjoying breakfast the morning after the wedding, you have spoiled us with such a personal level of service. I honestly felt as if our wedding day was a luxury house party. It felt so intimate from start to finish. I've often said that, you wouldn't be greeted with the same level of personable service at a large cooperate venue. This is what made our wedding day so very special.
A special mention to the incredible Ray, who ensured our wedding day went smoothly, as well as keeping on top of the beautiful roaring fires! Also, a special mention to Marion, who ended up driving me and my Mum to the church when the rain scuppered my country walk plans. All our very dear friends and family, have complimented us on such a beautiful venue choice, and how it is possibly the best wedding they've ever been to.
So, thank you once again for all you did. May we wander the country lane for weekends to come, dreaming of our very special wedding day at Hutton Hall."
V422,Hutton Hall,"From the moment we first stepped foot into Hutton Hall we knew it was our dream venue! We truly had the wedding of our dreams.
From staying the night before, to getting ready in the morning, to dancing the wedding night away, every part of the day was perfect. We could not have wished for anything more!"
V422,Hutton Hall,"My husband and I had the most perfect wedding day at Hutton Hall. The owner, Paola, offers brilliant wedding packages and the catering outsourced to Limeberry, was outstanding. The bridal suite and guest bedrooms are luxurious and comfortable. The grounds are outstanding and brilliant for photographs. I couldn't recommend this venue more!"
V422,Hutton Hall,"Words cannot describe how beautiful Hutton Hall is.

As soon as we pulled through the gates we knew this venue was for us. We had already seen a few venues and this on made us go WOW!

Every single room in Hutton Hall was stunning!

Paola and Francesca were so lovely and we were so grateful to get to know them and their family.

We felt so at ease at the venue and had the most lovely overnight stay and breakfast as well.

I am hoping I can stay again in the future to remember the great memories of our wedding.

A magnificent venue, would highly recommend.

Mr and Mrs Hernaman xx"
V422,Hutton Hall,"Hutton Hall had everything we were looking for from a venue its stunning and has the wow factor plus for me with the beautiful village church based just at the back of the grounds, over the little wooden bridge it couldn't have been more perfect for a church wedding and then reception location!
We hired the bridal suite and bedrooms the night before the wedding so we had access to the light, bright and lovely preparation room for myself, mum and bridesmaids to get ready with an early start on the day.

The marquee set up for the wedding breakfast was beautiful overlooking the grounds and the fountains and with the sides up as it was a nice day was just perfect.

I was initially a little worried about the space as we had 100 guests in the day time, and 30+ in the evening, but I shouldn't have been concerned as it worked brilliantly and never felt overcrowded. The dancefloor even though it's a separate room was constantly busy all night and the courtyard and main hall and bars were perfect for people to mingle!

We had so many compliments from friends and family about what a great venue and day it was and we were honestly thrilled.

The Georgian Manor house with its high ceilings and beautiful features was ideal as we wanted light and airy, with a feeling of glamour / grandeur. I have to say it had all this, while also feeling intimate.
We fell in love with Hutton Hall straight away, and booked very quickly after our first viewing. Francesca and Paula are brilliant and answered all my many questions and worked with us to coordinate the day. They also work with a great selection of their tried and tested suppliers who are not only nice people but deliver a top class service.

I cannot recommend Hutton Hall enough, and if you have any doubts over the suppliers included in the packages, we can confirm Limeberry catering provided a slick service the food was delicious, hot and well presented with a lovely team of waiting staff and DJ AJ (Paul G) was fantastic keeping the dancefloor busy all night too. They have such a great team on board here, which makes life so much easier as a bride, if I'd have known how great it was going to be, i wouldn't have wasted less time worrying about the little things!

Thank you so much for the best day of our lives.

V422,Hutton Hall,We had the best day at Hutton Hall. The building and grounds are beautiful and all of the staff are lovely! Paola helped us organise everything and answered all of our questions promptly. She supported us throughout the delays due to covid and was very understanding. We had the most magical day and Hutton Hall made it run smoothly and stress free! Definitely recommend.
V422,Hutton Hall,"Seamless day in the most beautiful venue. From the moment I viewed Hutton Halls website i knew it would be our venue. The whole building is stunning - from the blue room to the bridal prep room to the grounds.

It is run by the two loveliest ladies - Paola and Francesca who are always on hand to answer (my many!) questions.

The evening before myself and my bridesmaids stayed at the venue which I recommend doing as it made the build up so special. Paola bought us a nice cold bottle of Prosecco up and a lovely cup of tea for me (my favourite!). We ordered in food and had a really relaxed luxurious night in their beautiful bedrooms - the huge bridal suite bath is a must!

The day of the wedding was seamless. Everyone who came said it was the most beautiful venue they’d been to. The entrance hall when you walk in is breathtaking and there are many silk flower arrangements around helping the decor of the day look extra stunning.

The food on the day was spectacular. We used Limeberry who are a preferred supplier of the venue and I’m extremely fussy on food but wow - they really blew us away! The food was plentiful (nothing worse than being hungry at a wedding but no chance here!) and Angie who ran the catering side was super helpful and made sure we had everything we needed. The dishes were made gluten free with no issue and were delicious.

Our day was just everything we had dreamed of and more - the photos are breathtaking. I can’t thank Paola enough for pulling together the day of my dreams and being so friendly and helpful along the way.

If you’re thinking of holding your wedding here it’ll be the best choice you’ve made. It was a fairytale day"
V422,Hutton Hall,Paola was a great host when showing me and my fiance around the venue. I can't wait to visit here again and get married here next year! Thanks
V422,Hutton Hall,"Hutton Hall was everything we were looking for in our venue, and did not disappoint on the day. It was absolutely stunning, offering we wanted very conveniently located next to each other: huge and luxurious bridal suite and guest rooms, outside ceremony area, beautiful gardens for champagne reception and garden games, stunning marquee for the dinner, spacious areas inside for dancing, seating areas and two bars, and beautiful fairy light courtyard for our evening pizza. The team behind Hutton Hall are what make this venue truly ideal though. We felt supported and in very safe hands throughout the planning process and on the day, and truly felt like the whole team genuinely wanted our day to run perfectly...and it really did! You won't be disappointed!"
V422,Hutton Hall,"The bridal party arrived just after 10 o’clock to be greeted with a lovely smile and hug from Paola. We were left to get on with our preparations. But someone was on hand to help if needed.
What a fantastic venue. Lovely people. Fabulous grounds. We didn’t want to leave. Thank You to everyone at Hutton Hall for a great day."
V423,Smeetham Hall Barn,"If you are looking for a romantic barn setting Smeetham hall barn is the one…we can not thank Sophie and the team at Smeetham hall for being nothing but incredible through the whole process of planning our wedding and to the most amazing day we could have ever wished for…what we would give to relive the day all over again

Thank you once again for being so amazing

Mr & Mrs Field (Lucy & Rob) 05.04.25 X"
V423,Smeetham Hall Barn,"We first found came across Smeetham Hall Barn 7 years ago. After looking at other venues we kept being drawn back here. The venue and grounds are absoutely stunning. Sophie has been amazing from the very beginning, nothing was too much trouble even arranging for my nan to come along in her wheelchair which meant so much to us. Our day could not have gone any smoother. Our wedding breakfast was fantastic, a lot of guests complimented the food and the service from Splinters Caterers. We could not have asked for a more perfect wedding day!"
V423,Smeetham Hall Barn,"We fell in love with Smeetham Hall Barn from the moment we pulled up in the car. The venue is absolutely beautiful. Sophie was fantastic, from the very first email to arrange a viewing, right up to the big day. She took the stress out of planning our wedding and allowed us to simply enjoy the process. Nothing was ever too much trouble, and emails were replied to within the day. Our wedding day was the best day, and this is thanks to
Sophie and the team at the beautiful Smeetham Hall Barn. The only downside was that the wedding flew by so quickly; we wish we could relive it all over again."
V423,Smeetham Hall Barn,"Smeetham Hall Barn was the perfect venue for us. It was the only venue we viewed and an easy decision - it had everything we were looking for. It certainly lived up to our hopes and dreams. The barn and setting are naturally beautiful, without requiring loads of additional decoration. Their twinkly fairy lights set the scene perfectly. Having so many scenic spots for a variety of photograph opportunities is ideal. Our experience from booking to our big day was seamless. We were always kept informed and knew we’d hear back quickly if we had any queries. Sophie helped so much behind the scenes to ensure everything went to plan, she consistently eased any neves and went above and beyond for us. Splinters the caterers who are included within our wedding package were brilliant. The wedding breakfast was delicious and all our guests were very complimentary. Thank you to all at Smeetham Hall Barn and Splinters for being part of our perfect day. We loved every second and will forever hold the fondest memories 🤍"
V423,Smeetham Hall Barn,"Sophie and Victoria were absolutely brilliant in the lead up to our wedding, they were always ready to answer my many many questions 😂 They were so organised and made the day run perfectly. Tom behind the bar was brilliant too.
We’ve had so many compliments on how beautiful the venue was and how amazing the day was. We are both so grateful to the whole team at Smeetham Hall for everything they did for our perfect day. Would highly recommend!!"
V423,Smeetham Hall Barn,"Smeetham is such a perfect place to get married. The team supported us every step of the way, even when we were asking so many questions, and they were always so happy to help. Everyone is so kind and they understood our vision for the day. Everything went so perfectly and I couldn’t have ask for a better day! Thank you so so much!"
V423,Smeetham Hall Barn,"They say it’s the people who make your wedding, and that couldn't be more true. We were not only surrounded by family and friends but also by a team who truly felt like part of our celebration. A huge thank you to the entire Smeetham Hall Barn team, but with a special mention to Bridget, who welcomed us so warmly on our first visit that Smeetham instantly felt like home, and left us with no question that this was the venue for us. And to Sophie, thank you for all of your support throughout our planning journey, for always being just an email away with answers to our questions, for welcoming us at open days, and for being such a friendly presence on both our setup and wedding day whilst making sure everything went smoothly - we couldn’t have asked for more.

Smeetham Hall Barn itself provided the perfect setting for our autumnal wedding. Having worked in events ourselves, we were eager to find a venue with authentic charm, not a corporate feel. After viewing several other ‘barns,’ we started to wonder if we’d have to compromise, but Smeetham exceeded our hopes - it was everything we’d been searching for and more. With its unique, rustic character and all the amenities needed for a perfect wedding day, Smeetham Hall Barn truly stands out, and we feel very lucky to have stumbled across such a beautiful venue, less than half an hour from home. We were given complete flexibility to customise the space to suit our theme and add personal touches, with helpful recommendations for suppliers along the way. Having a full day to set up allowed us to truly enjoy the experience, extending our celebrations and ensuring everything looked just as we’d envisioned, without the stress or time pressures - a rarity in the wedding industry.

Looking back, our only wish is that we could do it all over again - it was truly the perfect day. We couldn’t recommend Smeetham Hall Barn more highly to anyone searching for their wedding venue."
V423,Smeetham Hall Barn,"Picking a venue is just….woah. It’s a LOT. Except when it’s not, because you’re made to feel like centre stage from the outset. We’d viewed a few venues which were starting to blur into one and a feeling a bit overwhelmed with it all. So if it’s the people that make a wedding, you can definitely include the Smeetham Hall team with that.
From the open evening, to booking and run through to the event (and MANY emails in between) they were only too happy to help. And encourage some out of the box fun with it.
SO many positive vibes from our guests about the venue itself from the ceremony on the lawn, the outdoor drinks reception and the barn itself for the wedding breakfast. Each element creating it’s own little piece of the day.
Great vendor partners on hand too to make sorting details like the food, DJ, lighting etc a breeze.
Thank you Sophie and Victoria.
James and Laressa Human"
V423,Smeetham Hall Barn,"WOW…where do we start! Firstly, we planned our wedding from Australia and from our initial video call with Bridget we knew there was something very special about Smeetham Hall Barn and we were in safe hands. Sophie - you were amazing, quickly getting back to my questions over the year and ensuring everything ran smoothly on the day. Tom went above and beyond for the evening bar, honouring a special request we had for an evening drink - so incredible! The whole process was seamless and we couldn’t be anymore grateful to everyone at Smeetham Hall Barn for making ensuring we had the best day of our lives, which we truly did! Cannot recommend SHB enough - thank you everyone, we want to do it all over again ! ♥️"
V423,Smeetham Hall Barn,"Our wedding at Smeetham Hall Barn on 10th June 2024 was absolutely perfect! The venue’s elegant charm and stunning grounds provided a beautiful backdrop for our special day.

The staff were exceptional, handling every detail with professionalism and care, allowing us to truly enjoy our celebration.

Smeetham Hall Barn offered the perfect mix of beauty, excellent service, and a warm ambiance. We couldn’t have asked for a better place to celebrate our wedding and highly recommend it to any couple looking for an unforgettable venue."
V424,Hedsor House,"After getting engaged on July 1st, 2023, I used Hitched to find local wedding venues and discovered Hedsor. From the moment we found Hedsor, we knew no other venue could compare (even without visiting in person).

We arranged a virtual tour with Kate and instantly felt a connection. She was professional, knowledgeable, and friendly, making us feel confident that we were in very safe hands. Although we initially planned to marry in 2025 due to other commitments in 2024, we found a rare opportunity to get married at Hedsor on December 29th, 2023. What started as a hypothetical possibility quickly became reality after talking with Kate and Hedsor's preferred suppliers. We decided to take the plunge (yes, we are mad!).

Since Hedsor's packages were unavailable during the Christmas break, we opted to dry-hire the house and worked with a mix of preferred and self-sourced suppliers. Organising everything in just four months was crazy, but Kate was always there to support and guide us through the process. We truly could not have done it without her and the wider Hedsor team!

As for the wedding day itself—just WOW. It was perfect from start to finish, exceeding our very high expectations. The house was beautifully decorated for Christmas, adding an extra touch to this already stunning and special place. Trish and the team ran the day like a military operation, allowing my husband and me to fully relax and savour every moment.

Thank you to everyone at Hedsor for making our wedding day the best day of our lives. It turned out to be even more than our dream day!"
V424,Hedsor House,My dream wedding in our dream venue. From start to finish Hedsor house was everything I dreamt of and more. The staff were amazing and they made our day stress free!
V424,Hedsor House,"Hedsor House.... Why wouldn't you choose Hedsor!? From the get go Hedsor ticked all of our boxes for the show-stopper Wedding we imagined. The bonus is that you have exclusive use of the mansion & we opted to dry hire the day before our wedding and had a pre-wedding celebration with guests staying in the house - it was amazing!

For our wedding day we chose the 1776 package and all the suppliers included were phenomenal, we also used suppliers from the preferred supplier list who were all great too.

The team at Hedsor are just brilliant, we cannot thank them enough for their quick responses and never saying no to all of the ideas we had.

Thank you Hedsor for the Wedding of our dreams, Stefan & Katie xx"
V424,Hedsor House,"Best wedding venue I have ever found, and I’ve been looking for a very, very long time! (Long engagement). Their packages are phenomenal value for money for what’s on the market, their open days are like a dream (honestly), and their customer service is absolutely excellent. I have been in talks with Hedsor on and off for a number of years as we opted for a long engagement and wanted to save for this incredible venue. They have been incredible the whole time, have never pressured us to book, and always been so accommodating and patient with our questions over the last few years. They have supported us every step of the way in such a non-pushy way, and we have now finally secured our wedding date with them and I couldn’t be happier. The packages take care of almost everything, taking the pressure and stress out of organising numerous different vendors (flowers, cake, food, decorations, RJ etc) there is almost nothing not covered or catered for within their wedding packages.

I honestly have not one bad word to say about Hedsor and the team. Having been in communication with them for such a long time, I can say they are consistent, reliable and lovely to work with - 10/10 for everything so far!"
V424,Hedsor House,"We recently had our amazing wedding at Hedsor House and did one of their signature packages the ‘1776’ package. We honestly had the best day ever and our only complaint was it went too fast!!
All the Hedsor team were absolutely brilliant and couldn’t do enough for us!
We’ve had so many lovely compliments from our guests on the stunning house as well as how smoothly the day ran and a lot of our guests have said it was the best wedding they have ever been too!
We would thoroughly recommend Hedsor House to anyone looking for a wedding venue and once you set eyes on the stunning house you’ll see exactly why!
But not only is it an absolutely beautiful venue but all of the staff are so warm and welcoming too making it the perfect venue!
I wish we could do it all over again!!!"
V424,Hedsor House,"We simply cannot fault anything to do with our Wedding at Hedsor. Our wedding was initially booked for December 2020, and had to make the decision to postpone to December 2021. Jennie and the Team could not have been more supportive. In the run up to the day, Jennie was on hand for all of my questions no matter how big or small.
When the day finally came, all of the staff were excellent. A massive shoutout to Matt who made everything simply flawless. I didn't have to lift a finger.
For a truly special wedding venue, Hedsor will never disappoint."
V424,Hedsor House,"Dream wedding venue with the best staff. Stayed here for two nights, and couldn’t be more pleased. We adore everyone at Hedsor house. Thank you for making our experience a memorable one. We love you guys!"
V424,Hedsor House,"Dear Jennie and the Hedsor staff,

There are truly no words to describe how thankful we are for you all. Our wedding day was perfect and that’s all thanks to you.
Jennie, thank you for always listening to our wants for our day and your speedy response times. It always made planning from across the pond so much easier.
I never had any doubts about how smoothly our wedding day would go because I knew I was in good hands.
On the day of everyone commented on how helpful the whole staff was. All of our guests were blown away by literally everything about Hedsor.
I will forever recommend Hedsor and your team. I wish we could relive the day basically every day, Hedsor is the most magical place.
Thank you so much for making our day so magical.
Any couple getting married is so lucky they have incredible people like you making sure their day is perfect.
We hope you all had a Merry Christmas and a wonderful start to the New Year!
Much love,
Mara & Patrick
PS. Thank you for the beautiful cutting board and bottles of champagne. We get lots of compliments on the beautiful cutting board!"
V424,Hedsor House,"Hi Jennie, Katie and the Hedsor team,

Thank you so so much for everything you’ve done for us. We cannot thank you enough and also really appreciate your patience with us when going through the visa and rooming process. My mother and father in law were able to be there after flying in literally the night before and we could not have asked for a more perfect day.

Everyone absolutely loved the venue and we received so many compliments.

All the house managers were absolutely brilliant and just wanted to say a special thank you to Vic who walked me down from my bridal room and gave me some fantastic calming words of advice before I made my entrance. He was absolutely lovely and cannot thank the team enough for everything on the day and on the morning after.

The official pictures haven’t been released yet however I thought I would send you some casual ones from the day. I will of course send you them when they come out.

Thank you again and we hope you had a lovely Christmas and New Year break!

Very best,

V424,Hedsor House,"Dear Natasha & the wonderful Hedsor team,

Thank you so much for all you did to help make our special day truly unforgettable.

Since the first day we visited, we knew Hedsor House would make the most stunning venue and the house and gorgeous views took our guests breath away. It will forever hold the most incredible memories of our most perfect wedding day.
We are so grateful for all your guidance, assistance and professionalism leading up to the day. We felt we were in the best hands every step of the way and it was always such a joy to read your kind and thoughtful emails.
We are only sad that the fun of the wedding planning with you is over and want to do it all again. We will cherish Hedsor House forever and we cannot wait to be able to visit again soon.
Thank you again!

Lots of love,
Alice & David xxx"
V425,That Amazing Place,"We held a small family wedding (about 40 people) here and 'wow' the place and the team, particularly Angie, certainly were 'amazing'! The main house is beautiful and quirky and set in beautiful grounds, whilst the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. It was spotlessly clean and felt very exclusive with it being sited away from neighbouring properties. We felt the setting was idyllic for our wedding and would certainly recommend it to others."
V425,That Amazing Place,"We got married at That Amazing Place on 9/11/24
What can i say! 100% have your wedding here, you will not be disappointed. From first meeting Angie and the team in 2023, all the way through they were fantastic. We stayed in the beautiful cottage the night before. Our wedding morning, service, meal, evening everything was perfect.
Nothing was to much trouble, Angie and the team
Styled the venue perfectly, following my exact instructions and more. Words can not express how grateful we are for such a fantastic support team.
The venue is beautiful, it truly has its own personality. Every single guest commented the same.
Thank you so much Angie, Louise and team. You made our wedding exactly how we had dreamed xx"
V425,That Amazing Place,We got married at That Amazing Place in august 2024 and what an AMAZING place it is. The staff were all so friendly and An extra big thankyou to Angie and Louise who went above and beyond making sure our day was just how we wanted. Both Such lovely ladies and nothing was too much. Highly recommend this amazing place to everyone. Thankyou Keighley&James x
V425,That Amazing Place,"WOW - That amazing place.
Firstly, it certainly lives up to its name & more.


From the moment we booked to have our wedding day at TAP, we knew it was going to be special!

All the months of planning, Angie & Louise have been there every step of the way. Angie was always there on the end of an email or a phone call. To help, guide or advise!


We had our beautiful wedding day on Thursday 24th October and it was just incredible.
That amazing place, really is a special place and we feel so lucky and grateful to have got to have our wedding day there.
From the beautiful characteristisc house, to the beautiful marquee to the beautiful lake and outside grass it really has it all!

Every single one of the staff cannot do enough for you, Paul & all the team are just the loveliest people and we’re so friendly and helpful with anything we needed.




The actual day ran so smoothly with not a single hiccup and I truly beleive that was due to Angie & Louise’s efficiency! They were amazing from morning to night and constantly checked we were ok and if we needed anything.


We would reccomend this venue to anyone.. and if we could do our wedding again, we would do it here again & again.




We will always look back on our day knowing the venue was a pivotal part and with a big smile!


Thank you for everything!
All our Love,
Mr & Mrs Ackerman xxx"
V425,That Amazing Place,"Where do I start... me and my now wife got married at ""That amazing place"" and not to sound too corny, but it was amazing!

The decor was both elegant and warm, whilst the space was perfect for our cosy big day!

I don't think I could rate this place any higher, but the staff made our special day all the more magical! They offered a number of wedding packages which we were able to tailor to perfectly suit what we had dreamt of... they were also so accommodating to all of our needs and implemented them fantastically.

The venue has good disabled access, and the staff had ramps they were all too willing to move around, which helped my wheelchair using mum fully experience our big day to the fullest.

We chose to stay the night, and accommodation was clean and luxurious, not to mention the delicious breakfast the morning after.

This all added up to a 10 out of 10 day and lifelong memory, a wondrous experience for me and my new wife."
V425,That Amazing Place,We got married here in 2024. We had the most amazing day all coordinated by Angie and her amazing team! Everything about the venue was perfect and how we wanted it. We had our family dogs there too to top it all off!
V425,That Amazing Place,"We knew from when we first visited That Amazing Place that we wanted to get married there and on the day the venue really was everything we wanted it to be. Angie and the team we so great and made sure we had everything we needed.
All our guests loved the day and the place and we’re so happy with how everything turned out.
It was such a magical day and we wouldn’t have changed a thing!"
V425,That Amazing Place,"I honestly cannot recommend That Amazing Place more! Angie, Louise and the rest of the staff were incredible from start to finish. We first met Louise and Angie in February 2023 when they showed us around and we instantly knew we wanted to get married here. They couldn’t have made the experience more straightforward and stress free for us. On the day, everything was taken control of exactly how I would have wanted and everything ran smoothly thanks to Angie and Louise. Who are both so lovely and welcoming! The venue was spot on, the house is beautiful and the marquee was perfect for a party. Louise even drove us over the grass in a golf buggy to make sure we got some pictures outside without getting too wet due to the rain!
Absolutely loved staying in the wedding lodge the night before, stunning house and got everything you’d need (Angie and Louise came to say hello the night before also making me feel so relaxed about it all). Thank you so so much for everything you did for us and for making our day so perfect. Couldn’t have wished for a better venue. Lives up to its name!"
V425,That Amazing Place,"We visited a few venues before That Amazing Place, but when we met Louise and walked around the venue we knew straight away that this was the place for us.
We loved their relaxed style and felt we could really have the wedding that we wanted and it did not disappoint.
Angie helped us to organise our day and used her experience to help guide us into making some sensible decision. I really felt as though she listened to what we wanted and was willing to accommodate our plans.

On the day it was the wedding we had dreamed of. both Angie, Louise and the TAP team were on hand to make our day perfect. They beautifully set up the venue and went above and beyond to make sure we were happy throughout the day.
I couldn't be more thankful to them for helping to create our perfect wedding. I will forever be grateful to them."
V425,That Amazing Place,"Angie and Paul helped us plan the perfect wedding for us. It was the most amazing day, just what we wanted. Calm, chilled, relaxed, no stress and everyone was happy. They are highly recommended! We can not thank them enough!
Highly recommended!"
V426,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"Down Hall was our chosen venue for our wedding day in August - we had a wonderful day and the team did a great job looking after us and our guests.
We worked with Zoe as our wedding coordinator who was fantastic and responsive to our requests and communication as we planned the wedding in a short space of time in 5 months!
The chef was great and modified the menu to suit our special fusion wedding. The results were amazing with all our guests commenting on how wonderful the food was (my worst nightmare averted of guests feeling hungry or having a poor food experience!).
The whole experience with Down Hall was great. The hotel was very busy for the weekend over the summer which did not affect our wedding day itself as had a team dedicated to us. We also had a family afternoon tea arranged the day before instead of a rehearsal dinner which was also amazing with great service in our private room.
We hope to return for our first anniversary!"
V426,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"The summary I would give our wedding is that the venue is stunning however the wedding coordinators and bar staff failed on several occasions to deliver the wedding we had planned or paid for.

I really did not want to micro-mange my own wedding but this meant things didn’t go to plan. Luckily as we had evidence in writing we did receive compensation for this however that doesn’t change what happened on the day.


Here’s what happened …


Planning Issues

We emailed our final planning information 2 days prior to our final wedding planning meeting. We then had our final planning meeting with Tracy who said everything was okay and on-track. 10 days later she then admitted she had not read the documents at the time of the final planning meeting and had now found a problem. There was a problem, which was my misunderstanding, and we resolved this however this is a great example of the level of service that we received.

We had asked (thankfully via email) if we could have a musician outside during reception drinks and were told we were so we booked one. When we then visited Down Hall we were told we were not allowed a musician. As we could provide the email from them saying we could have a musician they allowed us to have one but I would recommend to any potential couples to get all communication in writing as you may need to provide what you have been told!

These are just two of several fustrating interactions we had during planning!


Time Management

The time management of the wedding coordinators is terrible. We were left waiting on every occasion that we met with them, sometimes up to 45minutes with no idea what was going on. On our wedding day we were left waiting in the reception room for 20minutes wondering again how long we would be waiting with many things to do!


Wedding Ceremony Music

We provided a detailed run-though of the wedding ceremony and when music was meant to be played (nothing complicated, pre-wedding, entrance, signing and exit songs).

- The pre-wedding ceremony music was not setup by the wedding coordinator as promised and was playing through the ipad and not speakers when the Groom arrived.
- Tracy then proceeded mid-way through the ceremony to randomly start playing the second signing music song before realising she was drowning out proceedings and switching it off.
- The Ceremony came to an end and everyone was asked to stand and out their hands together (this took quite a while as my Grandpa is disabled) despite this delay and being given a script in advance Tracy then totally missed starting the exit music until we were 3/4 of the way down the aisle.

The team did offer us compensation for this.


Horsebox Bar

We had paid £500 to reserve the terrace and horsebox bar. When we asked the Food & Beverage team to open the horsebox bar back up after the meal they had to apologise and say that there was a mix up and no staff had been booked and this was not possible.

After the wedding we then complained to the Revenue Manager who claimed that this was agreed with us and this was reflected on the function sheet which we received prior to the wedding … this was a totally untrue!

We then (rather embarrassingly for them) sent them their own function sheet and highlighted the line which said “horsebox bar and terrace after meal service”. After agreeing that both the contract and function sheet said this should be open they offered us compensation. Once again showing the importance of getting everything confirmed in writing.


Prosecco

We brought our own drink and did corkage. During the post wedding drinks I went to the horsebox bar to get a Prosecco to then be told that was the last glass. I was surprised given how much we had brought. I found two bottles in the dining room and took them to the horsebox bar. These were drunk and then guests started buying their own drinks as a result of being told this was finished.

I was then very disappointed to be handed back 8 bottles of Prosecco when we checked out. When I complained about this the Revenue Manger said the guests were drinking G&T which does not answer the complaint at all and again reflects the level of service we received.


Summary

In summary, the venue is stunning however from reading previous reviews it appears that a completely new wedding team are at Down Hall. I would only recommend this as a place to get married if you are going to micro-manage your wedding coordinator, get everything in writing, and don’t trust the function sheet as this is not guarantee things will happen."
V426,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"Wow what an amazing wedding we had at downhall, the venue was absolutely stunning and the team were amazing and always there for you along the whole journey. I could ask for more the whole day was an absolute dream and that wouldn't have been possible if not for the amazing team. Thank you so so much xxx"
V426,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"Down hall were amazing for mine & my new husbands wedding day! The whole day went so well and it was so so organised I couldn’t of felt in safer hands! Our wedding was cancelled twice due to the pandemic, and down hall were so accommodating in moving us we couldn’t complain! The only thing that went wrong was the music when I walked down the aisle temporarily stopped twice, I was so nervous for the day, I wanted the ground to swallow me up. But it wasn’t anyones fault it was just a technical glitch! But otherwise Becky, Imran & Julie especially we’re SO AMAZING I couldn’t of wished for a better wedding team! Loved it so much I’d do it all over again! And everyone commented on how accommodating & beautiful the venue was and how delicious the food was 😍 Even down the the Easter egg hunt the hotel had on the next morning for the children! It was absolutely perfect! You can tell they have all the experience! Loved it! We can’t wait to come back to stay for afternoon tea, some lush dinner & a spa day 😍"
V426,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"My husband and I got married at Down Hall in December 21. Covid cases just started to get bad again and even though Stu and I were a panicked mess in the days leading up to it, Becky, Imran and their dedicated team calmed every concern and we had the most incredible day. They are flexible, accommodating and the most reliable people I have ever met. No request was too much and they did absolutely everything they could to ensure that everything went ahead without fault. We met with the organisers the day before to discuss final details and they had everything written down and ready before we opened our mouths, even down the sticking down the sign on our post box. The smallest touches made the day magical and their attention to detail is unmatched. Because of them, we have the most fantastic memories of our day. Thank you so so much xx"
V426,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,We had the most magical wedding day! Would recommend this venue to everyone
V426,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"The Down Hall wedding team worked wonders for us when planning our special day. They’re caring, efficient and clearly have years of experience in organising weddings - the value of which cannot be underestimated. Organising a wedding in 2020 has at times felt like trying to pitch a tent in a storm only for it to be blown away given lockdown and a series of changes to wedding regulations. The team helped us to navigate the various covid regulations without letting them dominate our special day and did so with the utmost sensitivity.

The grounds and function rooms are stunning and offer a gorgeous backdrop for your ceremony, pictures and celebrations. The rooms are spacious and the Liddel suite in particular is a treasure trove of a room with all sorts of surprises including a romantic bathtub with views across the grounds. The food was delicious and the day was a success despite such difficult circumstances. Thank you Down Hall. We would not hesitate to recommend you for anyone planning a wedding in the future!"
V426,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"We got engaged in January then went to down hall on valentine a day I had been there before to stay and just knew I’d love to get married there so booked a meeting with a Julie and booked straight away the whole experience was perfect so professional and easy Julie was the reason for that she made it stress free . Our wedding day was perfect everything ran smoothly and just how I’d imagined we stayed from sat till Monday. Toast master Simon was amazing run the day brilliantly .
I would encourage anyone to get Married at Down hall perfect venue."
V426,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"Right from the start we was not even sure if we could have this fantastic venue, due to our small and intimate wedding. But to our delight, Down Hall tailored and accommodated our needs every step of the way. We must say all of the staff were brilliant in every way possible.
The food was perfect, and presented beautifully, and our guests loved it.
My husband and I had the most magical day. Once again we would like to give a massive thank you to all of the staff at Down Hall, for giving us a day that we will never forget."
V426,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"We couldn't have asked for a better day. All our friends and family are still talking about what an amazing day it was. Venue looked amazing, service was excellent and as for the beef it was exquisite.
From the moment we stepped into the venue it felt special and the wedding team made everything so easy building up to the day and on the day.
It was so good we want to do it again every year!"
V427,Newland Hall,"I'm not even sure where to begin but wow! We fell in love with this wedding venue just over a year before our wedding day and we looked at other venues but we kept comparing them all to Newland Hall. From the get go we had amazing email and phone calls with Lucy and Kelly. No question or query wasn't welcomed which I think any bride appreciates. We were able to meet with Lucy 5 weeks before our wedding day and also a few months before to refresh our memory and see the venue again before our big day which again felt just right and we picked our venue right. We were able to drop off decorations the day before our wedding (stuff for the tables, post box, seating plan, welcome sign etc) and Lucy as always greeted with us with such warmth and I think knowing Lucy was going to be there on the day made me feel so calm. Now the day. WOW. Thanks to Lucy she took what I had in mind for the tables, signs etc and made it perfect (better than I could) again no question or request was too big to ask. I had so many guests tell me how much they loved the venue and I'm hoping I can return to Newland Hall as a guest to take it all in again. The food was amazing and all of the staff working on my wedding were lovely (kept making sure I had eaten and I had a drink) If you're thinking of Newland Hall do it! I wouldn't change a thing. I want to do it all over again! Also want to mention the DJ was amazing! Music wasn't too loud which was good and he judged how well the songs were going to decide what to play next and he had a lot of patience for me as I had requested quite a lot music. I was also able to choose the music for after the wedding and dinner part which felt really personal."
V427,Newland Hall,"This Gem is tucked away in a quiet location in Chelmsford and I am glad that my partner found it randomly. When we went to visit the venue, we was blown away and very stunned at the beauty and peacefulness of the location.
The staffs, Kelly and Katerina were very professional, helpful and friendly. They truly made our day feel special. The venue was very flexible as we had to reschedule our wedding due to covid-19 restrictions on wedding. They also listened to us and our requests and tried their best to accommodate them within their capability.
We had an amazing day and thank you for making our day special!
Cloudier and Ryan"
V427,Newland Hall,"From the moment we arrived at Newland Hall for the Open day we knew we had found the perfect venue for our wedding and the actual event proved that right, and more.
Kelly and her team at Newland Hall were brilliant; in the run up to the event they were accommodating and flexible to our needs and on the day itself the whole thing ran beautifully making it a fabulous day for all involved, the ceremony was absolutely lovely and the reception and buffet that followed turned in to the relaxed and friendly garden party atmosphere that we had hoped for.

Thank you all again for a fantastic day.

Ian and Deb 23 August 2019"
V427,Newland Hall,We got married outside on 21.09.19 as the weather was perfect.! All our last minute changes were catered for by Katerina who was brilliant throughout. The venue is so pretty and perfect for what we wanted. The bbq food was lovely and the whole day flowed perfectly. Would definitely recommend.
V427,Newland Hall,"Amazing Venue, perfect for the intimate wedding we were looking for. Beautiful surroundings and 1st class service from the staff. Would highly recommend for anyone looking for a picturesque location. We married outside with the BBQ option which was amazing too! Thank you, Newland Hall!
Ella & Darren Crossman 5th September 2019"
V427,Newland Hall,"The most perfect wedding Venue, got married here on Saturday and had the best day, people could not stop complimenting the venue and the food and all the staff it was amazing. We had Fran as our wedding co-ordinator, and she was amazing and done such an amazing job. Everything went so well and it’s because of her, she set it all up just how I wanted it and she made sure I didn’t have to think about anything on the day. We had a lot of guests, 150 during the day and more in the evening, so she had her work cut out, but she really did amazingly, you could see how hard she worked. Thank you so much Newland Hall and most importantly Fran she was amazing. Couldn’t recommend this venue and Fran highly enough.
Becky & Daniel Harrington"
V427,Newland Hall,"We got married here on May Bank Holiday Monday and we could not be happier!
We chose Newland Hall because of the exclusivity, the beautiful house and outside space! We were married outside under the gazebo which we were able to decorate with flowers and sashes. The grounds are absolutely gorgeous, with plenty of photo opportunities, in and around the house, marquee and the nearby fields and lakes! The food was delicious and the guests were full of compliments! Our wedding planner, Fran, was absolutely amazing, she set the venue up and dealt with everything, making it completely stress free, for us and our guests! Nothing was too much! Thank you!
It’s a shame it’s all over, but thank you for being so accommodating! We would definitely recommend.
Jasmine & Dan Banks"
V427,Newland Hall,"WOW .....! What can I say?? We got married at Newland Hall on the 01.09.19 and it was the best day of our lives. I firstly want to thank Katerina our wedding coordinator for all her hard work in the lead up to the wedding and her organisational skills on the day really shone through, she was amazing from start to finish making our day even more special. I would also like to thank the director Simon for all his help in the run up to our wedding also. The food and service were second to none and everyone commented on the food. It was a truly amazing experience from start to finish. The staff were attentive and friendly and kept the drinks flowing so everyone could enjoy themselves. There were no long waits at the bar either which kept things flowing. A massive, massive thank you to everyone at Newland Hall for making our day that little bit more special, they really made us feel so special.
Mr & Mrs Swinney"
V427,Newland Hall,"Everyone who attended the wedding and reception said they had a fabulous time and dealing with Newland Hall and yourself has been a very thorough and enjoyable experience.

Thank you for everything you did and also to all of the other staff who helped make our wedding day such a great day."
V427,Newland Hall,"Thank you so much for everything, our day couldn’t have gone any better! We had so many guests saying to us what an amazing venue it is and also how great the staff are, and we obviously completely agree with them, we definitely made the best choice!"
V428,Creeksea Place,"We knew Creeksea would be the venue for us when we first happened to see pictures of the Manor and grounds online some years ago. From the moment we arrived for our appointment to meet with Claire who was helpful, friendly and flexible to try and make our day exactly as we wanted it. We kept in contact with Claire for any questions and checking ideas until we were allocated Carly as our coordinator. Carly was absolutely wonderful, answering texts and calls whenever things came up and reassured us to no end about the weather! Carly’s knowledge of the venue and talking to us, helped plan a really good day and we were so well taken care of by the team at Creeksea who linked in with our vendors so seamlessly.

We had never seen the venue in summer/sunlight before our wedding day and we were absolutely blown away with how gorgeous Creeksea is. Everything tied together and Carly kept us both so calm and relaxed throughout. Every guest we spoke to commented on how beautiful the venue is and how everything was just perfect, with one person asking “can you do this every week?”. If we could, we would. We cannot thank everyone enough and will remember the day forever.
Thank you again."
V428,Creeksea Place,"We had a twilight wedding at creeksea last month and it was absolutely perfect. We live locally and always knew we wanted to get married at creeksea as it’s such a hidden gem.
We booked only 5 months before the date so it was quite a short lead in time and as a result we had lots of questions! Claire was absolutely fantastic and responded to every query quickly and with a personal touch.
The whole process, from start to finish, was amazing. Nothing was too much trouble. The fact that creeksea isn’t one of these wedding venues that books numerous weddings a week resulting in you become more of a number than an actual wedding was worth its weight in gold. We were made to feel so special.
The day itself was amazing. It truly is the most breathtaking venue. Our guests were blown away with how beautiful it was.
The food truck in the evening was an absolute smash with the guests. The food was out of this world and everyone is still talking about how good it was.
We would recommend creeksea over and over again to anyone looking for the most beautiful and personal wedding, it’s truly spectacular and the service you receive simply cannot be compared.
It was the most magical day and we want to do it all over again."
V428,Creeksea Place,"Creeksea Place Manor House in BoC for us was simply the perfect choice location for our special day. Not only is this gem site local to us, the venue itself is stunning & the staff are professional, helpful & friendly. Although our wedding was small & intimate of which is what we wanted, it was still perfect, details for us included having use of the bridal suite for myself as the bride to get ready alongside my mother & best friend & for my husband he could relax & have a drink/catch up with the family before the ceremony feeling very relaxed. Lastly financially it was fantastic value for money & even if we decided to have the whole day/package for a larger wedding the pricing is still very reasonable."
V428,Creeksea Place,"This is the most gorgeous venue and we are so glad we chose it for our wedding venue. There are so many photo opportunities, and so many different options for ceremony backdrops. Claire, our wedding venue coordinator, was fantastic. She literally answered any question I had at all times of the day. She made our day run smoothly and helped it be the most perfect day. Cannot recommend this venue and the staff enough."
V428,Creeksea Place,"We had our twilight wedding here and the venue is absolutely breathtaking!! Clare and Carly were amazing!! I must’ve messaged Clare 200 times and each time I got a lovely and fast response. No stress approach and I really felt the excitement was shared (that they love what they do). Me and my partner are very much into heavy metal and abit morbid 😅 we incorporated this into our evening and everything was embraced with open minds and arms!. The staff were all wonderful, the food truck was incredible and everyone raved about their food so I cannot recommend them enough also. The lawn games were a massive hit too! Everything was just absolutely perfect and everyone had a fantastic time.

A massive thank you to all of the Creeksea team!"
V428,Creeksea Place,"We recently got married here and couldn't have asked for a better venue. The grounds & house speak for themselves, as soon as we saw it we fell in love, but the staff are the real stars. Nothing was too much hassle, they were so accommodating, responsive & helpful. Carly is fantastic & made sure everything went smoothly on the day. Claire was brilliant too & was great in the build up to the big day. They couldn't have done more for us. Highly recommend Creeksea to anyone and everyone! Thank you for making our day so special."
V428,Creeksea Place,"Had our wedding her on Thursday and despite the outbreak of rain, the team made alternative plans to accommodate us and our guests! Had a wonderful night, thank you to all the team for helping us coordinate our day effectively!!!"
V428,Creeksea Place,"My Husband and l absolutely fell in love with this wedding venue the 1st time we visited there. Its a stunning venue and truly is a hidden gem and brings happy emotions every time I see it. To top off such a stunning venue. I have to send massive compliments to all the staff. They make Creeksea extra special. From the day we put a deposit down to book our special day, until after our wedding day the Management have been the other end of the phone whenever we needed them, day or night. On the day every single staff member was on point they were attentive, friendly and almost felt like family.
Being an older couple in our 40's we booked a twighlight wedding package which was great value for money. This included street food which all our guests and us absolutely loved was so tasty and worth the money. Even the DJ was great that came as part of the package. He was in contact prior to our big day and tailored the music exactly to our preferences. We did spend more on some optional extras, like drink packages, lanterns etc but all still within our budget.
The best wedding venue by far around in my opinion and my guests couldn't believe how great Creeksea was too.
We definitely be re visiting at some point for a stay out of wedding season.
5 star + venue by far."
V428,Creeksea Place,"We instantly knew we were going to book Creeksea when we stepped through the entrance gates. A beautiful Tudor red brick building which felt hidden amongst tall enveloping trees. The perfect setting for our English fairytale wedding! Moving into the orchard we were again blown away by the intimate peaceful nature of this venue with rabbits wondering the grounds and the simple sound of birdsong to keep us company. In the lead up to our day Carly, Claire and the rest of the team couldn’t do enough for us. Responding to questions so quickly and giving us their experienced advice which meant we got the most out of our day. They were also very accommodating with requests such as including a ring warming ceremony (which we decided on three days before the wedding day!) and an outdoor sparkler last dance under their fairy-lit trees, a standout highlight from our day! We were originally drawn to Creeksea for its stunning natural beauty but now see the true gem of this place are the people that work there. We can’t wait to return for future anniversaries and already feel a part of the Creeksea family."
V428,Creeksea Place,"Wow !!!! Everything was absolutely gorgeous the grounds , the bridal cottage, the exquisite Manor House. Every expectation was met by Claire, Michelle And of course John Paul . The planning was spot on and we’ll taken care of . We asked lots and lots and lots of questions and everything was answered. All recommendations from food to fireworks to dj flowers and balloons all were exceptional. The team at Creeksea really do go above and beyond. We could not recommend any higher than we do . They worked within our budget and delivered everything to the T with all our requests. A truly beautiful location and absolutely lovely team , if there was a fairytale godmother for weddings Creeksea is it !!! Love Emma and Grant Wylde"
V429,Rivenhall Oaks Golf Centre,"Charlotte and James couldn't do enough for us. From booking til leaving the day behind they were truly a delight to deal with.

An amazing venue with great picturesque views."
V429,Rivenhall Oaks Golf Centre,"The venue met all our requirements, canapé and champagne reception, 3 course served meal and event buffet for our guests. The food and service was outstanding.

The DJ was excellent and kept the dance floor going all evening. The staff went above and beyond when they used there own cars to shuttle our guests to the coach that couldn’t get up the drive!

A big thank you to Kelly, Jack and all the team for making our day so memorable. A fantastic place to have your wedding reception, we wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone."
V429,Rivenhall Oaks Golf Centre,"All the guests loved the venue and setting. The food was great and plenty of it which made happy wedding guests. It all went to quick so we will have to do it again some day.

Once again, thank you for all your help getting family to the coach and yet again collecting us from the lane. Your team were amazing."
V430,Downham Hall,"We had our very small interment wedding reception at Downham hall and can honestly say that every single member of staff made our day exceptionally special.
Nothing was ever too much trouble with a member of staff always close by to see to our every need.
If you are considering booking your day or special event at Downham Hall please don’t hesitate as you won’t be disappointed.
Can’t thank you all enough, will definitely see you again soon"
V430,Downham Hall,"We got married at Downham Hall in July 2023 and cannot recommend this venue enough! The location, grounds, rooms and surrounding views are absolutely stunning.

The service was outstanding, the staff worked so hard to make sure everything ran smoothly on the day and were very helpful and informative during the planning process.

The wedding packages they offer are very comprehensive and flexible meaning you can make your wedding day bespoke to you. For example we wanted completely meat free (vegetarian) catering which they were more than happy to create a bespoke menu for us.

I highly recommend you visit the venue to see it for yourself and if you do decide to book it for your wedding day, I’m sure you won’t regret it 💕"
V430,Downham Hall,"We had our wedding here 2 days ago. It’s a beautiful venue, the staff were great, really helpful, nothing was a bother when we asked them for anything. The food was fabulous and the accommodation is lovely. I would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a venue in Essex."
V430,Downham Hall,"We had an extremely tiny, completely bespoke wedding day at Downham Hall. It was absolutely perfect and everything we had hoped it would be. Christina, Debra and all the staff were amazing from start to finish and nothing was too much trouble. I cannot recommend Downham Hall highly enough. We have been back numerous times since. It’s like coming home."
V430,Downham Hall,"After two cancelled dates due to Covid at another venue, my (now) husband and I decided we were tired of waiting and got in touch with the team at Downham Hall just 5 weeks before we were going to tie the knot.

They really couldn’t have done more to accommodate our last-minute request. The team made us feel so so welcome, the venue was stunning, the food incredible and we had the most amazing day.

I really couldn’t recommend Downham Hall more!"
V430,Downham Hall,"Downham Hall proved to be the perfect choice of wedding venue. It's a beautiful country house with stunning grounds and an amazing team, who went above and beyond from start to finish, to make our day perfect. Genuinely can't recommend highly enough. One visit is a all it took for us to know we wanted to get married at Downham Hall and we're both so pleased we did."
V430,Downham Hall,"Had a very special day.
Tailored to suit our needs.
Attention to details and very professional from start to finish."
V430,Downham Hall,"Downham Hall allowed us to have our perfect wedding. Even when we were due to get married outdoors and the great British weather turned on us the team were brilliant with changing to an indoor ceremony at the last minute. We were able to choose exactly what food we wanted for our wedding Breakfast and evening meal (even allowing us to provide our own signature cocktail to our guests!) The staff were very attentive throughout the day and the breakfast the morning after with our closest family was amazing! Would highly recommend as a wedding venue. We both still enjoy going back to the venue for meals and afternoon teas now, the views are beautiful and food always amazing!"
V430,Downham Hall,"Oooo I cant believe its been 2 years since our Wedding at Downham hall. The venue was perfect. They had the most beautiful room with fireplaces that i knew i wanted to get married in. The gardens look beautiful no matter what the season. There is just so much character in the building and the grounds surrounding Downham hall. Everyone at Downham hall are friendly and helpful, its so lovely that Christina and Andrew are so invested in all their guests. Everything on the day ran perfectly, which I knew it would. The food! Its was amazing! Which made an extremely difficult to decide what we would have on the day. Our evening buffet was a huge success, it was all beautiful presented as well as being delicious. If your looking for a intimate wedding, Downham is perfect, the whole venue is exclusively to you and your wedding party which adds and beautiful personal touch to your day. You can tell that all the staff care about making the day perfect for you, nothing was too much trouble at all."

Special thanks to Annette & Pacco for treating us so well and made me feel special. The food for dinner and the buffet was lovely and the venue stunning. Great price too.

The rooms are beautiful - we had a small ceremony and lunch and a big party and the flow of the rooms worked well. The grounds are beautiful for photographs. Food was amazing and they catered for our dietary needs (coeliac and vegan) with no fuss. Lots of our guests stayed over so breakfast was fun the next day!

We would like to thank Clair, Annette, Vik and all the fantastic staff here at the Mary Green Manor for taking care of us during our Wedding Celebration over the weekend of 5-7 August ( and the lead up up to our big day).
Thanks to the warmth and excellent hospitality of the staff at your hotel . It really is a fabulous venue and we couldn't have been cared for more. All the guests we have spoken to said the same.
You are all exceptional at what you do and we both looking forward to coming back many times in the future to see you all again.
Love and best wishes

V431,Marygreen Manor Hotel,We had a fantastic day at the Marygreen Manor Hotel. Everything was perfect and nothing to much hassle to make this day the best day of my life. Staff was excellent from the planning to the Bartender. The food was amazing and the Courtyard garden is so beautiful. I would recommend this Hotel to all my friends and will definitely come back.
V431,Marygreen Manor Hotel,"We had a fantastic day at the Marygreen Manor Hotel. The food is super tasty, the staff can't do more and is so helpful from start to finish, the venue is beautiful and all is taken care off. We will never forget and definitely return on every anniversary"
V431,Marygreen Manor Hotel,We had our Wedding here and form the planning stage to the actual day it was amazing. Our Wedding was a small bespoke event and Ms Annette the Duty Manager was very professional and extremely helpful. Every member of staff was very friendly and nothing was to much trouble. The venue is stunning and the food outstanding. I would recommend this venue to anyone considering having their wedding or just the reception here. You will not regret it.
V431,Marygreen Manor Hotel,"We had our Wedding Reception at Marygreen Manor Hotel with family and friends in from the U.S., South America, and the UK. The Hotel, venue, and staff were amazing to us from the planning stage or our wedding, which we were doing from the US, to our actual wedding date. They offered bilingual staff, incredible service and professionalism to both us and our guests. The venue is gorgeous and our wedding pictures really highlighted the beauty of Marygreen Manor. The rooms were gorgeously steeped with history and comfort. The garden was beautiful and the food delicious. We suggest all to visit the Marygreen Manor for dinner and /or to stay with them and experience the Manor yourself."
V431,Marygreen Manor Hotel,"We had a beautiful Wedding here. The staff were friendly, professional and attentive. The garden is very pretty and relaxing and the historic decor is lovely. we married in the Henry VIII Suite and had the reception her too. The whole day was amazing.We had the Catherine of Aragon bridal suite which we be able to enter early to get ready. Nothing was to much trouble for the staff. All my guests commented on it being the best wedding they'd been to, it was beautiful, relaxed and intimate. The food was delicious. We enjoyed a fantastic choice for breakfast the next morning. Again the staff could't do enough to help us. I;d highly recommend getting married here. We felt like royalty and loved every single second of our weekend."
V432,The Manor at Bickley,"The Manor is the perfect venue for weddings! When our wedding venue fell through 4 months before the big day, I stumbled onto the Manor at Bickley and spoke to Craig. He was most helpful and kind and went above and beyond to make sure our wedding went ahead.

We hired the venue for our two day wedding and the staff were helpful and accommodating from start to finish. All of our guests were awed by the beautiful well kept grounds and the excellent service. We can’t thank the staff enough for making our wedding dreams a reality. They thought of every detail from bringing us champagne after our civil ceremony to making sure we had our card box at the end of the night! We are excited to head back to celebrate our anniversary there!"
V432,The Manor at Bickley,"Myself and my Husband chose this venue for our wedding last week and we can’t sing The Manor’s praises enough. From our very first enquiry, to the first viewing of the venue, right though until the big day, the staff at the manor have been nothing short of brilliant! Each staff member we came across was polite and accommodating. Special mention to Craig and Vicky with whom we did most of our liaising throughout the months leading up until our wedding. Craig and Vicky were super helpful, responsive and went above and beyond to make sure that we could have the day of our dreams. Even with last minute changes due to the weather, Craig who was just incredible throughout, managed to help us sort a backup plan so our day would still go ahead seamlessly.

The rooms at the manor were spacious and modern, giving us and our wedding party lots of space for photographers and videographers to capture the special moments on our wedding morning.

The lodge that was used for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready was fabulous. The manor was very flexible in giving us early access so we could get ready on time.

The grand marquee was definitely grand! Very spacious and when decorated looked like something out of a fairytale! lots of kitchen space, a huge bar and fantastic overhead speakers for the party!

The manor was super flexible to our needs regarding access, start times, outsourcing our vendors and much more. The venue is beautiful and spacious with options for outdoor and indoor events and entertainment. The grounds were absolutely beautiful, so many lovely spots for photos not only for us as the bride and groom but for guests too!

A very special thank you to our point of contact throughout, Craig. From our first meeting, he was charming, bubbly and made us feel super welcome. He reassured us that he has experience in African/Caribbean weddings and that our wedding day would amazing and it was. He was attentive and always let us know that he was only a phone call or e-mail away and was always quick to respond and answer any questions we had.

All in all, we had the most beautiful day at The manor and we would definitely recommend this venue for a wedding or other events.

Nkechi & Harold"
V432,The Manor at Bickley,"We hired The Manor at Bickley for my daughters wedding. Got a brilliant service from the venue. Everything was set accordingly, as per floor plan. Our guests were loved the venue grounds/facilities and the overall wedding set up.
Thank you to everyone at Bickley."
V432,The Manor at Bickley,"A warm and friendly service from the very helpful staff, a feeling that it is your own house! The food was amazing and the atmosphere made us and our guests feel fantastic."
V433,Channels,"No words could describe how beautiful and stunning Channels Estate is. Right from the very start of viewing Channels all the way to our wedding day, we were made to feel comfortable. The communication was absolutely amazing and they helped make our day a very special day. Katie was our coordinator, she was kind, sweet and helped us make our day one to remember. We would highly recommend Channels Estate

Mr & Mrs Edwards"
V433,Channels,Katie made our dream come true. She was attentive and organised which made the running of our day feel so smooth and organic. The venue itself is stunning and luckily we had nice weather which just made the day even better. Everyone loved the food and the service was excellent. Couldn’t have asked for more.
V433,Channels,"Channels provided a great experience throughout. The team (led by Karen) were extremely helpful throughout - they accomodated all of our needs, worked well with the suppliers and coordinated the day brilliantly. Venue was set up beautifully and food was of a high standard. On site hotel rooms were luxurious and reasonably priced for our guests. Would recommend the venue without question."
V433,Channels,"We got married 31st March 2023 at channels, from the moment we booked channels Karen and her team were incredible, communication was great all the way through. Our actual day was fantastic from morning till night Karen and all the staff were helpful, friendly and just couldn't do enough for us and our guests! Would highly recommend channels"
V433,Channels,"Wedding Day - 9th April 2023
Couldn't be happier with the venue and how our wedding day went, Karen and the rest of the staff were brilliant and took care of everything for us and always made sure we were alright and that it all went perfectly. They were lots of fun and we couldn't recommend them highly enough. Thanks!"
V433,Channels,"The venue is stunning, food is beautiful. And the staff are welcoming happy and seriously can not do enough for you.
Nothing is too much.
Can not rate this place enough."
V433,Channels,"What a perfect day we had, marrying at The Channels Estate. A couple of months before our wedding day, our wedding co-ordinator needed to be changed. We were handed over from Molly to Katie, and the handover couldn't be smoother. Both Molly before, and Katie once handed over couldn't have been more helpful. A couple of weeks before our day I began to have bride jitters about the planning and organisation of decoration etc. Katie replied to my email very quickly, putting my mind at ease.
On our big day, Hayley and Karen couldn't have been nicer and more helpful. Hayley single handedly tidied the outside area before our ceremony as it had been left quite a mess from the previous wedding the day before, and Karen was on hand following the ceremony with the electric swatter to deter any wasps after the Pimms! Every member of staff we spoke with was lovely and did all they could to ensure we had the most wonderful and calm wedding day. Channels is a beautiful venue, I just wish we could do it all again! Thank you all :)
Jasmine and Dave x"
V433,Channels,"I am a little late in writing this review as we got married in September 2021. It truly was the best day ever and we are so glad that we chose Channels for our wedding day. We knew it was the venue for us, from our first visit where we met with Paul and he showed us around. The venue had everything we wanted, a beautiful barn, great grounds and lots of gorgeous accommodation, which was a must for us. We stayed the night before in The Retreat, which was amazing, with lots of room for us to get ready and although the weather was not on our side, and we could not get married in the ceremony garden, in the end it didn't really matter. Molly was our coordinator and she was incredible. It was like she could read my mind, and everything was exactly as we wanted, without us even having to think about it. The day went by in a flash and the venue looked amazing. We didn't have to think or worry, it all just happened seamlessly. The staff worked so hard and the food was amazing. All our guests had the best time and were so complementary about the venue and they loved the accommodation. It really was perfect the day. The best part is that, as it's not just a wedding venue we can visit again if we want to and book to stay in the hotel for our anniversary. Also must not forget to mention James who works at the hotel. He must have rearranged our accommodation booking so many times and was so kind and helpful. We had to postpone by 6 weeks due to a member of our immediate family becoming temporarily ill. James, Paul and Molly were very understanding while we tried to rearrange our wedding day to work with all our guests and suppliers. 10/10"
V433,Channels,"Wow! What can I say?! There are quite literally no words to explain how wonderful channels is. From start to finish, Paul, Eleanor and the whole team could not have been more friendly and accommodating. They took our vision and made it reality without breaking the bank too much. Every single element was perfect from food to decor to operation. It was faultless. Everyone adored the food and said just how beautiful it looked. Thank you to the most wonderful team! We appreciate you so much!

If you’re considering channels…….just do it!"
V433,Channels,"Channels staff were fantastic both in the planning of the day and organisation on the actual wedding day, we couldn’t fault them. Staff were friendly, helpful and proactive. The wedding day was amazing and so many people commented that it was the best wedding they’d been too.

We planned our wedding for what turned out to be during the pandemic. Channels were so proactive, responsive and helpful with rearranging our day, and even helpful with our wedding insurance claim for the rearrangement.

It’s a stunning venue with plenty of outside space. We’d thoroughly recommend it :)"
V434,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"Firstly Christie and Sarah the Wedding Coordinators were so friendly and couldn’t do enough for us on and before our wedding day! They were so approachable and personable. The staff at Greenwoods were all so friendly, helpful and genuinely cared about us having the best wedding day it was so very appreciated! All of the staff, from the maintenance and support staff right through to the management went above and beyond to make our stay and wedding the best experience. One lady cleaning our room went out of her way to help us with getting extra towels and bits we needed on my wedding day. Another gentleman who served us for breakfast also went above and beyond to upgrade us to a better room because our TV and electric went off in our bridal suite and they wanted us to have the best experience, which was such a nice touch and honestly made our experience so much better! Cannot fault the place! 5 stars!!!"
V434,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"Everyone has commented to me how gorgeous our wedding venue was and they aren’t lying.
Service was second to none, every staff member in that building treated me like I was a celebrity throughout my stay there for our wedding and I will never forget it!
Special mention to Shannen who looked after us thoroughly throughout wedding planning
Love Mr & Mrs Stam
Xxxx"
V434,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"We got married at Greenwoods recently and I all can say is wow and thank you!!

Our day ran perfectly and that’s solely down to the staff here - some of who were working all day - but even by the end of our night, nothing we asked for was too much trouble.

The food was outstanding - we had many guests comment on how great it was especially seeing as they were catering for 100+ guests - it didn’t feel like a typical ‘large event’ meal but something you would expect in a restaurant.

The venue is perfect, beautiful grounds and a stunning garden suite and there was no stress for my husband and I as everything was looked after, the staff clearly have a lot of experience in weddings as they were there and ready for the next part of the day before we were!

I couldn’t recommend Greenwoods enough to any couples thinking of choosing it as their wedding venue!

Thank you again!"
V434,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"Cannot put into words just how perfect this was. 2 night stay plus wedding ceremony, reception and evening. The attention to detail was fantastic. Venue stunningly beautiful. Food was lovely and service very good. Wedding coordinator was excellent. It really was just perfect"
V434,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"Perfect venue for a perfect wedding.
The whole day ran like clockwork and nothing was too much trouble for the staff team as we were gently directed throughout the day. My niece looked beautiful and happy as she walked up the aisle in the lovely gardens.
We had a brilliant time and at the end of the day an extremely comfortable bed.
Thank you so much."

V434,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"It was faultless from the moment we arrived to the moment we left.
Great rooms, more than pleasant staff (who bent backwards to accommodate the six of us plus two children under 5 ) the wedding, the wedding reception, the food and then the great breakfast in the morning
I would highly recommend this place !"
V434,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"This is a gem of a place which deserves much wider recognition.
Don't usually write reviews but felt compelled to break my code of silence for this experience. My daughter chose Greenwoods Hotel & Spa as her preferred choice of venue for her wedding reception.
From the moment she and her entourage arrived at 7.30am on the day of the wedding the staff could not have been more helpful. The level of service and attention to detail were exceptional. Shannon, the hotel's wedding co-ordinator, was on hand throughout the day and evening giving re assurance, confidence and updates on timings and procedures which is what you need on days like these. Such a cool mature head on young shoulders!
Food and silver service at the wedding breakfast were impressive and plenty of bar staff on hand throughout the evening so none of those unseemly 'scrums' ever developed at the bar for drinks; and the Garden Suite function room literally takes your breath away when decorated.
Overnight accommodation did not disappoint and breakfast plentiful.
So if you are planning a wedding put Greenwoods on your short list. You won't regret it."
V434,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"We recently got married at Greenwoods. From start to finish it was a perfect experience. The Library room was stunning, the reception room was beautiful. Nothing was ever too much trouble. All the staff on the day were happy, helpful and brilliant. The food received constant compliments - it was delicious!!!!
As a very nervous bride I wouldn't have been without Shannen - our wedding coordinator. She was simply amazing - made me feel relaxed and really special - i just loved the care and attention. The whole day went without a hitch and Shannen and the team even delivered beautiful sunny weather! We are so so pleased we picked Greenwoods for our wedding. We cant wait to head back for a stay on our anniversary! Thank you everyone!! love, Michelle and Jon xxxx"
V434,Greenwoods Hotel Spa & Retreat,"Chris and i would just like to say a huge thank you to you and all the staff involved in making our wedding the best day of our lives. The day ran so smoothly and that is all thanks to you and the amazing team at Greenwood’s. So many of our guests have commented on the day from how beautiful the venue was decorated, to the delicious food and the friendly staff.

The day completely surpassed our expectations and we we cannot thank you enough for making it the most special and amazing day of our lives.

Thank you again,

Chris and Helen"
V435,Crondon Park,"In terms of the beauty of crondon park you can see for yourself...

But the care of the people that work there were unbelievable. Honestly, nothing is too much for them. You are paying a lot to get married (anywhere!) but somehow most people still feel embarrassed to ask lots of questions or things they don't understand. Crondon never made us feel bad for asking questions and clarifying things, asking for adjustments and just being reassuring.

They were so helpful on the lead up, everything was clear and on the day they were faultless. I'd definitely recommend them to anyone!

We had 103 guests so on the higher side and it was still plenty of space.

The food was also incredible!"
V435,Crondon Park,"It was an amazing day! The place looked stunning.
Thank you for your hard work. You have made our special day incredible"
V435,Crondon Park,We had the most special day! I honestly do not think I could have changed a thing!! We were so well looked after for the entire day
V435,Crondon Park,"We had an absolute fantastic day, everything ran smoothly and staff was so helpful and friendly. Jo our front of house was lovely and helped us throughout the day, even when my veil needing securing she was able to help. We would highly recommend Crondon Park, our day was so special and would love to do it all again xx"
V435,Crondon Park,"My partner and I first visited the venue after getting engaged back in February 2023. We were greeted by Kara, who was nothing short of friendly and supportive. It was one of the first venues we had seen and booked the next day.

The process towards the big day was excellent. We would regularly be in contact with Ellie who would also answer any questions or queries we had. The communication was always quick and reassuring. We came to a few afternoon tea and special dinners they organise to get more of a feel for the place and we knew we had made the right decision.

As for the big day itself on 12.4.25, well it was absolutely perfect. Our front of house Jo, was nothing short of amazing, professional, friendly and went above and beyond what we expected. Thank you Jo! The food was absolutely delicious, the service was impeccable. A big thank you to all the chefs, waiters, cleaners and anyone else who was involved behind the scenes to make our big day so magical. The rooms were also amazing for our guests, as well as the Lily Suite, that me and my friends stayed in the night before. And of course, the honeymoon suite too.

We cannot thank Crondon Park enough for making our wedding so special. If we could do it all again, we would. Who knows maybe a renewal of vowels one day? :D

We would highly recommend this venue to any couple. 5 star service from start to finish. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you Crondon Park! The big day and experience will be cherished in our memories forever."
V435,Crondon Park,"I would like to say a huge thank you to the team at Crondon Park for making our wedding the most amazing smooth-running day. And a special thank you to Kayleigh and Kara, it truly shows how passionate you are about your Job.

Having our wedding at the beginning of December, Crondon Park had already had their Christmas touch décor up, the sun going down early made the fairy lights extra magical.

From the moment we booked the team were very attentive and reliable at getting back to emails throughout the months leading up to the wedding. I’m a big believer that communication is the key, and they had made everything stress free. They met our every need and went above and beyond to accommodate our requests.

Our guests are still talking about it until this day, the food had high compliments, even heard it was the best brownie they had ever tasted!

No words can explain this day in a nutshell, but I will say, if you are considering booking this Venue for your special day, then please do not hesitate!

Eve & Roberto xxx"
V435,Crondon Park,"A fantastic day, really well organised, great venue and fantastic food and service! Thank you so much for helping make it an amazing day"
V435,Crondon Park,"Wow, absolutely fantastic day from start to finish.
Beautiful rooms, lovely food and service.
Lovely breakfast the next day a well.
Perfect!!"
V435,Crondon Park,"Such a great wedding, good vibes, i would definitely recommend!
I also have several allergies that the staff dealt with easily, extremely helpful.
Thank you all so much"
V435,Crondon Park,"We had the most perfect day, thank you so much for everything.
It was just amazing! Every one of our guests constantly said what a beautiful venue it was. We both really appreciate all the hard work everyone put into not just yesterday but over these last 2 years."
V436,Villiers Barn,"I don’t think the words I’m trying to find even exist in the dictionary, to describe this truly breathtaking, spectacular, unique, initiate venue - VILLIERS BARN is out of this world and that’s all down to Juliet & Barry, the Venue owners & directors & their son Jonathan who offer a 7-star, first class service. All three are extremely passionate about their business & they go above and beyond from the moment we viewed, booked & then had our wedding (last Thursday), no job was too big for them.

We viewed VILLIERS during its renovation & as soon as we drove up the lane, there was something so very special about where we had just arrived, historic, traditional - but different from any other typical barn wedding venue I’d seen online / been to as a guest. VILLIERS holds something special & unique.

VILLIERS was the first & only venue we viewed - we knew it was the one for us. We went back to see progress & it just kept getting better and better. I can’t praise the venue, the setting, the owners & staff enough.
We had an Amalfi (Italian) Coast themed wedding, the barn is simply stunning & speaks for itself - our theme fitted in perfectly, but as would any other theme over the last year I’ve seen villiers host many weddings & no two weddings have been the same it’s incredible - versatile VILLIERS! 👏🏽

Every time we viewed VILLIERS after booking, I felt so choked in the ceremony room, the barn, by the lake as I just knew this was the only place I see myself getting married to my fiancé, our wedding day was perfect & we have had fabulous comments from family and friends - saying it was the best venue & best wedding they’d ever been to, spectacular settings & top class service and so well organised.

To Juliet, Barry & Jonathan and their wonderful staff - your passion shines through & we can’t thank you enough for having us & making our day perfect, I’m so sad our wedding day is over - but the memories we’ve created will last forever & will play out like a film in our minds.

I can’t recommend VILLIERS BARN enough, if you want the best wedding, then book the best venue.

Thank you all again,

Harriette & Charlie Blackshaw-Clare 🤍🍋💙"
V436,Villiers Barn,"Where do I even begin with this beautiful venue?! From the very first visit to Villiers Barn, we knew this was the venue for us! The whole family were super friendly and helpful when showing us around after the first viewing we were hooked and knew we had to have our wedding here!

Throughout the whole year Jonathan was especially helpful with all the communications, questions and on hand to help with anything, nothing was too much trouble!

When it came to the wedding day everything happened with such ease, Jonathan, Becky and Ellen were on hand and made the day super smooth including the help setting up the venue making it perfect!! They gave us the wedding day of our dreams! It couldn't have been more perfect and everyone was so attentive in getting our drinks, taking us where we needed to be, the food was INCREDIBLE also and will be dreaming of that for a lifetime! Also the new seating area outside with the log heart is a lovely touch!

I couldn't recommend this venue highly enough and can't thank everyone at Villiers for the most memorable day!"
V436,Villiers Barn,"5 stars is not enough. We got married here on 22nd March 2025 and from the moment we booked the whole team were so responsive and helpful. The whole day went so smoothly thanks to the incredible team. A big thank you to you all for helping set the venue up exactly as we wanted and talking the time to ask questions where needed. The food was delicious and the portions were perfect, we received comments all day long from our guests saying how much they enjoyed all the food and drink on offer. The venue itself is absolutely stunning. Neither ourselves or our guests wanted for anything all day long as the service was outstanding. Truly thank you for helping us have one the best days of our lives."
V436,Villiers Barn,"We got married in Villiers Barn on November 7th 2024.

The minute we viewed the barn back in September 2022, we knew this is the place we were going to say ‘I do’.
Juliet, Jonathan and all of the team that work at Villiers are absolutely incredible!
2 years of constant communication, answering any questions we had and just checking in on us, this made our countdown even more exciting!

The BIG day arrived and we couldn’t have asked for anything more. The day ran smoothly and I would even say perfectly!
Jonathan was incredible, letting us have our time we needed, checking everything was okay and when we wanted to do certain timeline of events if we were busy talking to guests (or even dancing away), there was no pressure.

Not forgetting the Venue & grounds are stunning in itself & with the amazing team you’d be silly not to book to have your wedding here!

I’ve told everyone it was the best day of our lives and it truly was! Thank you for making our day amazing, I will never forget the dedication of the team for making our day so special and personal to us. 🤍

V436,Villiers Barn,"Villiers Barn is an absolutely stunning wedding venue with so much rustic charm! From the moment we booked, the team went above and beyond to make everything perfect, and Juliet in particular was incredible—so helpful, kind, and attentive throughout the whole process. The food was fantastic, fresh and beautifully presented every detail felt thoughtfully planned. If you're looking for a beautiful, welcoming venue with a brilliant team, Villers Barn is the perfect choice."
V436,Villiers Barn,"Wow where do we even begin?

We got married at Villiers Barn in December & it was truly our dream venue. After visiting a few venues in Essex & Suffolk (which hadn’t ticked all our boxes), Villiers was the last venue we visited & wow we did save the best until last! The venue itself is gorgeous and suitable for any wedding across the seasons. The venue has a mix of a classic/rustic feel but also really modern and elegant. We fell in love as soon as we saw it. Juliet showed us around initially & we fell in love with her too!! She is so passionate about what she does & cares so much about you, making you feel so welcome! She makes you feel so special and taken care of. We loved that Villiers is also a family run business & knew this was the venue for us.

We really can’t fault the Villiers Barn Team.…Jonathan was BRILLIANT at providing information and responding to all our questions over the two years we spent planning. His replies were always so quick and this was honestly so reassuring for us, and made us feel like we were in very safe hands. He arranged our taster evening for us (which we highly recommend) where we essentially had a private dinner date at the venue, tasting the food options. He also helped arrange any visits we wanted at the venue in the lead up.

Becky helped us to set up the day before our wedding & also co-ordinated the wedding day for us with Juliet. We can’t thank Becky enough for all the help, support & love she showed not only us but all our bridal party and guests. She went above and beyond to make sure everything ran seamlessly for us (along with the rest of the Villiers team we had on the day).

The day itself ran so smoothly, with all our guests complimenting us on how beautiful the venue was. Even in the storm, wind & rain, the venue is just beautiful. We also had such delicious food that came out piping hot - all our guests were raving about how good the food was throughout the day.

At the end of the wedding day, we stayed in the honeymoon lodge accommodation which was so convenient & so lovely waking up the next morning with breakfast already prepared for us.

We really had the best day and are so grateful to everyone at Villiers Barn! We can't thank you enough! We really hope we get to visit again as guests for a wedding in the future.

Lots of love from Mr & Mrs Stanway xx"
V436,Villiers Barn,"Villiers barn wedding venue will always hold a special place in our hearts after our big day on 25th October 2024

Jonathan was so supportive, helpful and had so much knowledge whenever we needed guidance whilst planning our big day. We also met Jonathan’s mother, Wife and sister who were equally helpful if needed.

As soon as we see the venue we fell in love and knew we wanted villiers to host our special day. The venue has a really warm feel to it. The grounds and barn are spectacular and the attention to detail was out of this world

We cant thank everyone at villiers enough for helping make such a special memorable day. We loved every second."
V436,Villiers Barn,"From the moment we went and visited the venue, we were in awe of how beautiful it is.

Still, that means very little without a wonderful team, and Villier's Barn delivers in spades. Jonathan, Juliet, Becky, and everyone else we've dealt with were unbelievable.

From Jonathan answering our millions of questions as we approached the big day, to Juliet being so warm and helpful when dropping off our assorted decorations, to Becky literally putting on buttonholes right before the ceremony, we couldn't have asked for a better experience.

Everything ran smoothly, the staff were helpful throughout the day, and nothing was ever too much trouble. My wife and I are genuinely a little sad we can't do it all over again!"
V436,Villiers Barn,"Villiers Barn was the first and only venue we viewed. It was absolutely breathtaking from the minute we viewed it. The staff were very warm and welcoming. We then booked it and throughout the whole process nothing was too much trouble for the Villiers Barn Team. They did an amazing job on the day of our wedding and met and went above and beyond our expectations and we are extremely grateful.
The biggest of thank you's to Juliet, Jonathan & Becky.
All our love Richard & Chanel x"
V436,Villiers Barn,"Where do I begin? Villiers Barn was the only venue we viewed. To when my Fiancé proposed and I found the venue through my photographer I knew I’d found the place I wanted to get married in.

From our viewing with Juliet, we signed on the dotted line there and then. Jonathan was then a constant communication path for my 1000s of questions over the next 3 years. If I could give 1000*s I would, Jonathan was our rock! He would answer every question, provide every detail, no request was to much trouble and I genuinely felt so calm throughout the whole process.

The family team at Villiers care about your wedding day as much as you do, you’re treated like royalty & your guests will have the most incredible day. Down to the morning of the wedding Becky was just amazing, making sure me and my bridesmaids had everything we needed. To the ceremony and day when Jonathan had everything coordinated. My glass was always topped up, food was served by the masses and was incredible. Our music played through out the day and the little moments we had in our honeymoons lodge for some time to ourselves was so special. Jonathan and his wonderful wife & partner made sure everything was packed for us to ferry away the following morning, they even arranged special gift we received while staying at the lifehouse spa after the wedding.

I want everyone I know to get married at Villiers so they can experience the most incredible day as we did.. and of course catch up with our Villiers family.

Thank you again for absolutely everything, words simply aren’t enough. All of our love always Samantha & Adam xxxxx"
V437,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"Amy, Vicky and Laura were absolutely amazing throughout the whole process of my wedding, the planning, the lead up and the day itself. Nothing was ever too much trouble and they were always very quick to respond to any queries we had.
The staff at The White Hart are amazing and made me feel very calm and comfortable while getting ready for our big day in the amazing bridal getting ready room, which was one of the highlights of the day as there is so much space for everyone with make-up artists and hair stylists etc meaning there was zero stress.
The food was great all round, we had a meal the night before, the wedding breakfast and breakfast the day after were all just amazing, cannot fault anything with it.
Honestly the best day of our lives, so glad we choose this venue to get married, we would highly recommend to all!!"
V437,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"From the moment we booked our wedding at The White Hart, Laura was nothing short of exceptional. She not only helped us arrange every detail but also provided us with fantastic recommendations for photographers, entertainment, transport options, and venue decorators. Her communication was always swift and thorough, and she answered every question we had, making the entire process seamless from start to finish.

On the wedding day, our heartfelt thanks go to the wedding coordinators, Vicky and Amy who ensured everything ran smoothly and took the time to review every minute final detail with us a week before the big day. They managed every aspect of the day from start to finish, making sure everything was perfect. They both, along with their staff assisted guests with check-ins and helped (early - considering a late finish) with breakfast the following morning—going above and beyond in every way.

Thank you also to Luke and Bradley, for their incredible support. Luke, in particular, made my wife feel like the most important person on the planet. His care and attention was extraordinary, making my wife feel like she was the only bride to have ever gotten married at The White Hart. For also, calming me on my walk up to the venue, thank you. The personal touch he added to the day for us both made it truly unforgettable.

I’d also like to offer a special thank you to Vicky, who provided me with much-needed emotional support on the morning of the wedding. She was there to reassure me, address my concerns, and help calm my nerves—exactly what I needed before greeting guests, sat anxiously waiting for my arrival followed by my Niamh's arrival.

As someone who was feeling a little anxious leading up to the day, I couldn’t have asked for a better team of professionals. With them running everything, we were in great hands. Our wedding day ran exactly how we envisioned it, and it was nothing short of perfect! From the management to the chefs and waitstaff, every detail was thoughtfully taken care of, and it was the most magical day of our lives.

A huge thank you to the entire team for making our day not only flawless but incredibly special. We truly couldn’t have asked for more & we will regularly visit for a the extraordinary food and drink on offer.

All our love & support,

Ryan & Niamh X"
V437,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"We had our twighlight wedding on 19 October 24 and everything about it was perfect and magical. The staff were fantastic in terms of planning and on the day, nothing was too much trouble, particular mention for Laura, Vicki and Amy 😊"
V437,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"We just had our wedding day at The White Hart and all I can say is EXCEPTIONAL! from the day we booked Laura was always on hand to help us and answer any questions we had about our day or the venue. So attentive she even worked late to help us secure a new DJ after issues with our original one. She went above and beyond through the whole planning process. She is a calming influence and incredibly organised and professional which is just what you need when planning a wedding. OUTSTANDING SERVICE! Additionally the front of house staff on the day were all incredible and made everything run seamlessly throughout the day and late into the night. Vicky and Amy, you two were amazing! We can’t thank you enough for making it even more perfect than either of us could have imagined. You are all superhero’s and I’m so impressed that even the tiniest of details and planning were followed exactly as I had asked. I can’t thank you all enough. If you are planning to get married and want the confidence of knowing your venue and it’s staff have your back and will make your day exactly how you picture it then look no further than The White Hart! Best venue ever! ❤️❤️❤️"
V437,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"Got Married in July 2024, from start to finish Laura our wedding day coordinator was amazing with fantastic attention to detail, our day went so smoothly with Amy and Viki as our wedding day managers, all of our guest raved about all three courses.
The grounds were absolutely stunning for our photos along with there five star accommodation,

Well done white hart team for making our day so special , we can’t wait to celebrate our anniversary with you!
⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
V437,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"Our wedding was brought together with the expertise of Abbi, Laura & the whole white Hart team. The day ran so smoothly and everything was on point like clockwork! They helped answering any questions we had and went the extra mile when needed. If we could we would get married here all over again-fab venue and value for money!"
V437,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"The Barn at the White Hart is amazing, a beautiful setting and welcoming environment. The process was easy and they were patient with me and my many questions. The meetings were eye opening for details we had never even thought about, but so worth it!

The wedding itself was more than we could have ever dreamed of, everything ran so smoothly! This meant that we could enjoy ourselves and not worry about anything, the team had everything we needed and were so accommodating.

Everyone commented on how much they enjoyed themselves and all were amazed by the food, it was as good as it always is.

We cannot thank everyone at the White Hart enough!"
V437,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"There wasn't a moment during our planning with the White Hart, or the day itself where we didn't feel cared for. Originally, we chose to view it as thank to its website we knew it welcomed LGBT couples. From our first meeting. we were made welcome and everything was done to make sure neither one of us were sacrificing just because there were two brides!
The barn was perfect and the suggested DJ is phenomenal and great at reading a room. Even though it rained, there was no impact on the day. The staff were flexible, attentive and (most importantly as two ex-service workers!) everyone seemed to really like being there. We had complex dietary requirements with some guests and these were addressed brilliantly, with these guests getting personalised menus. There were also perfect vegetarian and vegan options. The guests in question went out of their way to thank us for their lovely menu, and none of them were treated any differently.

The biggest thank you to Laura and Abby for planning and managing the day. You were fantastic. An extra shout out to Josephine, who was a delight the whole time we were there and was the friendliest face as I walked over to meet the registrars."
V437,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"Lovely place, just perfect with lovely Barn an pub on the side, accommodation on site was just superb. Laura and Abi made all planing so easy and helped us to have perfect day"
V437,The Essex Barn at the White Hart,"I could not recommend the White Hart more as a venue.
Laura and her team were professional and attentive throughout the entire wedding planning process, and will be as involved as you want or need them to be. Nothing is too much trouble for them.

The venue itself is beautiful, in a peaceful country setting, we loved it from our first visit. The mezzanine floor was something I'd never seen before at a venue, and I really felt it added something different and alternative to the venue, plus meant that if the weather took a turn for the worse, (which we were lucky to avoid on our day!) you or your guests won't get wet moving from ceremony to reception!

The bridal preparation suite is also beautiful and spacious enough for all you need in the morning, plus a view out over the front of the Inn where you can see your guests arriving!

Our guests have all commented on how lovely the venue is, as well as the gorgeous accommodation and amazing food. We are looking forward to returning for dinner or even to stay in one of the beautiful rooms.

We highly recommend the White Hart, the service is second to none, and the Wedding package prices are really competitive, we didn't have a huge budget but still managed to afford all we needed and wanted."
V438,The Lawn,"We had a really beautiful wedding day at The Lawn. The experienced team were very helpful with the planning and professional throughout, taking any potential stress out of the day so that we could relax and fully enjoy our special day. Everything went as planned, including the weather allowing us to get married outside in the very pretty gazebo (there was a great back-up plan in case of rain so we didn't have to worry!). Our 60 day guests enjoyed a three course meal which was of great quality; we had many compliments about the food and service, including the evening buffet for 110 guests. The Lawn is a fantastic setting for a wedding, coupled with great service, that we would thoroughly recommend."
V438,The Lawn,"I cannot express the gratitude I have for The Lawn. We had our day on the 25th May 2024 and from start to finish the staff were amazing.

The food was stunning! The venue itself is absolutely breathtaking. Thank you so much for making our day what it was… perfect. I could not recommend this venue enough."
V438,The Lawn,"Where to start? From beginning to end, The Lawn were the perfect venue choice! Not just because of the stunning house and gardens, but because David and the team made every step as stress-free and enjoyable as possible (even with all the questions we kept pinging them). We knew before we visited that The Lawn was the venue for us, to the point we booked then and there! We had absolutely no worries leading up to the day about how things were going to run and throughout the day there was always someone on hand (and with a smile). Honestly, words cannot express how wonderful our day was - utterly perfect! Thank you for everything!"
V438,The Lawn,"We were married in September 2023 and had our reception at the lawn. As it was an African-British wedding, we had many requests which the team at the Lawn really helped with. As we had exclusive use, the bridal party could get dressed at the Lawn before heading to Church and the parking was great for our guests travelling from long distances. Guests loved the horses and grounds. They particularly commented on being well catered for. It was a perfect day!"
V438,The Lawn,"The team at The Lawn helped us to host the perfect wedding. The amount of effort, thought and care that went into supporting us and everything we needed to make the day a success is amazing, this is possibly the first family event we’ve hosted where we have not felt the need to stress over a severe anaphylactic reaction.

From the minute we met we both felt at ease and confident our day would run smoothly, no question or request was too large.
They went above and beyond for us and it was truly appreciated, everyone has commented on the beauty of the venue as well as how smoothly and effortless the day ran.

We would honestly recommend the lawn for anyone looking for a venue to host a celebration - the venue is beautiful and the staff are absolutely amazing."
V438,The Lawn,The best day ever!!! Couldn’t of been any better thank you so much!! All the staff were fab and so so helpful nothing was ever to much hassle. Felt like one big family will be forever grateful!! Love chelsea and sam xx
V438,The Lawn,"Where do I start, we cannot thank you enough for hosting our wedding on Saturday. Your staff were fantastic and the whole day could not have gone any better.
I always knew I wanted to get married at the lawn as my own parents married here 24 years ago, I was 12 years old. 4 years later Matt and I got together and finally after 20 years we had our own special day at the lawn.

Everything from the planning beforehand, adapting the menus so everyone could eat the same including anyone with dietary requirements to how everything kept to schedule.
I was an emotional wreck most of the morning getting ready but you made sure I did not have to worry about anything downstairs and when I finally got to see everything I was blown away.

A special thank you to David, Michael and Lizzie. You are brilliant at what you do.

The caterers and waiting staff were amazing. The food came out all at the same time, was hot and extremely tasty. The staff serving were so kind and accommodating.

This day was long overdue but we were lucky our children got to share it with us like I got to with my parents and you all made it the best day which we will never ever forget. My parents said the high standards you set on Saturday was exactly the same when they got married and it really is the best place to get married so anyone looking for a place to have their wedding and reception book in quick you will not be disappointed.

Thank you again
Jade and Matthew.
Finally Mr & Mrs Judge xxx"
V438,The Lawn,"Wow! What can we say? A perfect day was had at the Lawn, with superb organisation, friendly staff and a beutiful building!"
V438,The Lawn,"We would just like to say a massive thank you for making our twilight
wedding such a magical experience for both of us.

From your patience in answering all our questions leading up to the day to
your almost fanatical weather watching all afternoon (who knew there were so
many apps?! ) and then your ability to switch everything to outside at the
eleventh hour to ensure we could have the service in your beautiful gazebo
just made the perfect start to an amazing evening and the start of our
married life.

Thank you again so much and we send our warmest wishes to you all"
V438,The Lawn,"The whole team did everything to make our day so special. Unfortunately the English weather didn't play ball with us, but it didn't affect the day at all. Everyone was so helpful and the day ran so smoothly. We just wish we could do it all again! Would recommend as a wedding venue!"
V439,Gosfield Hall,"I never imagined my wedding would be somewhere as stunning as Gosfield hall but from the minute we saw this venue we knew it was the one for us and didn't bother viewing anymore venues as we had already made our minds up about having our wedding here! We were absolutely blown away with the natural beauty of Gosfield hall and so booked two years in advance of our wedding day! The professionalism and advice we received from Linda was super helpful and informative on the run up to our wedding as there is soo much to think about! We loved that we could have our day and evening all in one place aswell as the option weather permitting to have our wedding ceremony outside. I'm pleased to say the weather was absolutely perfect on our wedding day and we got to have our fairytale wedding outside! The package we paid for was well worth the money! Our guests were absolutely spoilt on our day and have all said it was the best wedding they've ever been too! It was amazing to have our guests stay over aswell! Jocie our wedding planner was absolutely amazing! She was sooo friendly and super accommodating and went above and beyond on our day to make it absolutely perfect with no hiccups! She even helped dress me on the day as she knew how to do up a corset dress and my mother didn't have a clue lol she made all my wedding details and decorations come to life and done such a stunning job decorating our dream venue aswell as being super supportive towards me my family and guests! The honeymoon suite is the best we've ever seen and completely took ours and our guests breaths away! Mind blowing! The food,venue,grounds,accomodation and night before accomodation were absolutely stunning and we want to thank everyone at Gosfield hall for making our day soo incredible and special and a day we and our guests will never forget! We can't wait to return to Gosfield! Thank you everyone at Gosfield what an amazing place!"
V439,Gosfield Hall,"We had previously experienced Gosfield Hall as a guest before deciding on it for our anniversary.

Our day was beautiful and went according to plan. Our guests all had great feedback about the day.

The only thing we would have changed would have been more diverse menu for the main meals."
V439,Gosfield Hall,"Gosfield hall is a beautiful location for a wedding and their packages cover all the important stuff! We didn’t have to worry about caterers, wedding coordinator or a DJ - all included! Great service, lovely food and everyone really enjoyed the day! Our coordinator Jocie was fab on the day, getting everything organised and fetching anything we needed. Couldn’t have asked for better, she knew the time line and the day flowed really smoothly!"
V439,Gosfield Hall,"We got married at Gosfield Hall and everything about it was perfect from when we arrive to view it, booking, the communication and Faye Carter our wedding Coordinator! If you want the best wedding day with no hassle, Gosfield is your place!!"
V439,Gosfield Hall,"Myself and my Wife have just got married at Gosfield Hall,
Our expensive started when we viewed the venue and we first met Linda sales manager, she welcome us in & made us feel at home, we wasn’t sure how, but she made us feel calm like this was where we was meant to be.
Once we looked around at all the venue has to offer we had already made a decision as this is such a stunning location and instantly new this was what we wanted! It was just right for us.

We did not get made to feel pressured to make any decisions immediately however we did end up booking our big say within the next few days after our visit.

Our next contact was with Ellie our wedding planner, she was very helpful and nothing was ever to much, we enjoyed the food tasting at the venue and was very impressed with the experience, it was out of this world.
Ellie helped us through all of our problems and made sure all of our plans come to life.

Now on our big day, what can I say? The staff were amazing, Ellie couldn’t have done enough every time you wanted to ask a question she was next to us any time we needed something. She was there all the way through the day/ night & even the next morning, Ellie made our day Run seamlessly.
We’ve been to many weddings before but never have we had food as amazing as we did here.
Every guest was amazed at the food quality and commented on how delicious it was!
Just to sum up if you’re thinking about booking your wedding at Gosfield Hall don’t question it just book it. You will be amazed."
V439,Gosfield Hall,"The venue is stunning and was the perfect setting for our winter wedding (so much natural light even in January). Jocie Golbourn was our assigned wedding planning specialist and she is so kind, sweet, patient and professional. All our guests loved the venue but many actually commented on how flawless and seamless the day was organised and rooms decorated and prepared from each section of the wedding and we only have Jocie and venue staff to thank for their meticulous planning and preparations. The food and drinks were delicious. Couldn’t recommend this venue enough- we actually booked the venue on a whim and were SO happy when we visited for an open day. There’s no false advertisements- it’s stunning."
V439,Gosfield Hall,"Everything, from start to finish, was exactly what we wanted and more. The preparation was helped by our wonderful personal manager, Tara, and accommodated each and every one of our requests and needs. The venue is gorgeous, food delicious, and atmosphere felt special. Our friends and family all told us that this was such a spectacular wedding for them that it was the best they've ever been to. We felt completely taken care of, kept us calm and happy throughout the day, and kept all of our suppliers in place and to standard. It felt glamourous and unique. We wish we could relive the day over and over. It really was our dream wedding."
V439,Gosfield Hall,"We got married in Gosfield Hall in May and had the most amazing wedding day that any couple could ask for. The whole experience from the arrival the night before to leaving the day after was seamlessly managed by the team at the venue.
The house and the grounds looked absolutely stunning and Ellie and the team did a brilliant job at keeping the day running smoothly without making anyone feel rushed. Everyone there was immensely friendly and helpful and we really felt that everyone who worked there was invested in making our day feel special.
We fell in love with the venue when we booked it but the whole experience exceeded out expectations so much that we wish we could do it all again!"
V439,Gosfield Hall,"I wanted to take a moment to commend and state our appreciation for Jocie. She truly was phenomenal, approachable and no task was too big.
We had 5 months to plan our wedding and we loved every moment. With us both working in the service industry it was great to have someone who was so switched on and would be an asset to have on any team."
V439,Gosfield Hall,"Having just got married at Gosfield Hall I can honestly say it was the most beautiful venue and the most perfect day. The staff were so attentive and professional. The food was outstanding and the drinks and cocktails were fabulous. They couldn’t do enough to make sure our day was everything we’d dreamt of. I have to say a special thanks to Ellie - one of the wedding coordinators on site - she went above and beyond to help us plan our day and was there from the very moment I woke up delivering fresh pastries for breakfast to the moment she made me a cup of tea to go to bed with. I can’t thank you enough Ellie, you are an absolute credit to Gosfield Hall."

V441,Leez Priory,"I never in my life thought I would get married in a place like Leez priory! The whole experience from start to finish was just fantastic. The price breakdown was manageable and there was no pressure to take any upgrades offered. The things we got in our package were phenomenal and having a wedding planner was tremendous - our lady (Leanne) was an absolute god send!
They catered to all our needs and we were made to feel so comfortable and nothing was a problem! I’d highly suggest going to an event there before hand, just to get a feel of what it’s like full of people and enjoy their delicious food. We actually enjoyed their entertainer ( singer) so much we hired him for our wedding ☺️
Lee priory is just so beautiful. I can’t speak highly enough x"
V441,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory on the 7th of September 2024. Considering how long they have been a wedding venue, they were pretty flexible with some of the ideas we had for the venue styling that turned out amazingly!

The staff really made the day something special and couldn't have done enough for us. Special mention must be made for Leanne, our wedding planner, who was amazing!

Highly recommend the venue and the incredible team that helped to make our day so special!"
V441,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in October 2024. This venue is stunning both inside and out with immaculately kept grounds and interior. The hospitality in the lead up to and on the day of the wedding was fantastic. The food was also brilliant. Another great perk of this venue is the amount of on site accommodation.

A couple of drawbacks / experiences during our wedding. There are only a few toilets in the main building which kept blocking and overflowing throughout the evening which led to us taking some guests to the dressing room or honeymoon cottage to use the facilities. You are also restricted by the venue on any external food or drink suppliers and the venues optional extras for this are quite expensive for what they are.

That asaide, we had the best day and evening at Leez Priory and would certainly recommend it!"
V441,Leez Priory,"We got married at Leez Priory in August 2024- great venue and experience from initial viewing to leaving the morning after the wedding. Leanne acted as our wedding planner and was friendly, professional and helpful throughout. We opted for the classic package and the food was amazing quality with everyone commenting how full they were!
The venue is beautiful with several options for ceremony both inside and out. Accommodation was great too. The whole day ran smoothly with perfect weather - we will have very happy memories of our day!"
V441,Leez Priory,"Perfect venue and very attentive staff, lovely food and great communication from start to finish"
V441,Leez Priory,"Stunning venue. Fantastic Team. Very accommodating toward our unique ""surprise"" strategy. Our guests were truly surprised. Thank you."
V441,Leez Priory,"Leez priory was the 1st and only venue we looked around when we started planning our wedding. From the moment we stepped on the premises, everything just looked so perfect and exactly what we wanted from a wedding venue. When we got assigned our wedding co-ordinator Rachel, she was just absolutely spot on with everything we asked for and nothing was too big an ask for her. She made sure the day ran as smoothly as possible and took care of any issue that arose without me knowing (which I am forever grateful for!!)
The rest of the staff were amazing and very helpful.

The venue itself is just absolutely stunning and we loved that it has the pub area as well as the dance floor so it catered to all of our guests.

All of the rooms were lovely and it was so nice being able to stay in the fisherman’s lodge onsite the night before the wedding.

We genuinely cannot recommend this venue enough and it was 100% worth the money! 10/10!"
V441,Leez Priory,"We got married on a Tuesday in October to maximise the value of what we could get for our money; and honestly, we got everything we wanted and more. Leanne, our Wedding Manager was perfect at bringing an attention to detail and seamless organisation to the big day, and in the lead up. There wasn't one moment of the day where we felt stressed, as Leanne had it covered. In one particular instance, our flowers for the bridal party's hair hadn't arrived. Within five minutes of telling Leanne that we needed this, the flowers were with our hair and make-up suppliers to add the finishing touches.

Leez Priory as a venue is the most stunning setting, and offers an incredible range of areas in which the ceremony and reception can take place. There is also the opportunity for the bridal party to make use of the Fisherman's Cottage the night before the wedding, and for people to stay in the on-site accommodation on the evening of the wedding, making it the perfect venue for people also travelling from further afield.

Leez Priory were very accommodating, welcoming and were happy to work with us to make our day as perfect as possible. The food was incredible, and a total hit with all of our guests, and so many people have commented on how incredible the day was as a whole. You wouldn't be disappointed to choose Leez Priory."
V441,Leez Priory,They catered to our every need. To when we would ask for things they hadn’t been done before they still made sure it went smoothly. Leanne was amazing she made me feel so comfortable from the start. The whole day was stunning. Beautiful venue please go view it as you will not be disappointed
V441,Leez Priory,We got married on the 26 May 2024. This venue was absolutely brilliant! They catered for every need and made sure there was no stress on the day. Leanne was kind and level headed throughout and was always one step ahead! Do not hesitate to book- do it now!
V442,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"Best day of our lives!

The Roslin wedding experience was absolutely flawless from the first meeting we had to the day after our most special wedding day!

Amy and Evan were so supportive and understanding throughout the whole planning experience. They both made us feel so special.

Stefan was exceptional on our wedding day, keeping the day running smoothly and meaning that we could both enjoy the day ourselves without having to worry.

We have had so many people say it was the best wedding they have ever been to. The food was just perfect.

Garry, the DJ was a really nice guy and the dance floor was full all night. Thank you so much Garry!

The bridal suite is absolutely perfect. So many beautiful little touches. The stay was wonderful for all of our guests and the breakfast was outstanding. Even the ladies on the checkout desk made us feel special.

Thank you so much to everyone at the Roslin for making our wedding day so perfect and run so smoothly!

Lots of love,
Mr & Mrs Pope x"
V442,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"Thank you so much for all you have done to make our wedding so perfect.
From the very beginning the team have been communicative and friendly. Very quick replies to emails and quick to answer questions with helpful advice and tips.
On the day the team ensured that everything ran as smoothly as possible. The food was incredible and we have received many compliments regarding the catering team.
The team were both professional and friendly and nothing was too much trouble.
Our stay overnight was in a gorgeous room with a beautiful view.
Breakfast in the morning was delicious.
Thank you again."
V442,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"Well, Amy and the team - what can we say?? Our day was absolute perfection. Here are some things we would like to comment on to demonstrate just how amazing the day was:
Ceremony - complete attention to detail - we were not going to have a signing table as we had legally married the day before - Amy was honest and said the room would look bare and she was absolutely right - so glad we decided to listen to Amy's advice. The room was decorated stunningly - there was such attention to detail - extras of our flowers were placed tastefully in vases around the room, there were lanterns and candles that we had not asked for but made the room look more finished. There were extra centre pieces we had provided - these were placed in different areas to compliment the theme.
Bridal party arrival - upon arrival there was a complimentary bottle of prosecco for the party in the bridal suite. The suite was beautiful and our bouquets were laid out so nicely for us. We asked for some more champagne flutes and straight away, within 2 mins there were some at our door.
En route to the ceremony I was worried about the song and when everyone had to walk in - why I was worried I do not know as Amy had listened to it numerous times and knew exactly when to send everyone in. Amy and Evan even sorted out my dress so it looked beautiful walking down the aisle.
Throughout the ceremony the team had tidied the bridal suite room and put chocolates and petals on the bed. When I went to show my husband the suite, I had warned him that it had been a bit of a mess - but no - Amy and the team had ensured it looked almost as if noone had been there!
Drinks reception - we went for photos on the beach and whilst this was happening there was canapes and prosecco - at previous weddings people had commented that they (as bride and groom) had not had the opportunity to try their canapes as they had been doing photos - but the team had thought of this and Tate brought us out our own little plate with 2 of each canapes each.
The change over was swift and the room looked fabulous for dinner thanks for Evan and her guidance - Amy had suggested having a smaller number of tables and more people on each otherwise the tables would look bare - again absolutely the right decision. We had some elderly guests and while the change over was happening they were given chairs to sit on which was no drama whatsoever for the staff.
The meal - everyone raved about the food - it was sublime - presented so tastefully and portions were generous. It was a really lovely touch that Tate went around and asked every single table, not just the top table, how their food was. This was great as I have never seen this at a wedding before.
Again, turnaround for the evening was flawless and the ballroom looked beautiful.
Other things that made our day extra special - everyone who was part of the wedding party received room upgrades free of charge which really made everyone feel special; we didnt have time to try our cake, but the team had realised this would be the case and on arrival to the bridal suite after the evening there was two slices of cake presented beautifully with some of the left over flowers, as well as our gifts and cards and the left over drinks from dinner service. Nothing went to waste as the bottles of wine that were not used at dinner were left on the bar for guests to enjoy in the evening too.
We cannot fault the service or staff at the Roslin at all.
A few special mentions -
Nicky behind the bar - you are a wonderful woman and made sure nothing was too much - you made drinks with love and were a real hit with the guests, everyone said how wonderful you were. Thank you for being great.
Tate - wow - you were so calm and collected - if we wanted 5 mins to ourselves that was not an issue - nothing was too much to ask. You ensured the day ran smoothly (we were always on time throughout the day) and you ensured that everyone was well looked after. Thank you - you are fantastic at your job.
Evan - You ensured the turn around of the room was done quickly but with class and flawlessly finished. Thank you.
Amy - what can we say - your team are an absolute credit to you, and it is because of you that we had a wedding that was more than we ever could have dreamed of. Your operations runs like a well-oiled machine but at the same time ensures the authenticity and personalism of every single wedding, to ensure it retains it individuality. Some weddings have felt like 'conveyer belts' but every single person spoke so highly of you, the team and the venue. Thank you endlessly for your love and dedication to what you do. It is very evident.
One small thing - oh... who are we kidding! The day was the most perfect experience. We will treasure The Roslin and our treatment as bride and groom forever. You are wonderful people, great value for money as a venue and you will always hold a special place in our heart. Thank you. Mr and Mrs Lee"
V442,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"Where to begin…. If anyone is thinking of having a wedding here, DO IT! The most stress free and lovable venue we could have asked for, Special thanks to Evan and Amy were incredible leading up to and on the day! The venue is stunning, the food was sooo goood, and the staff were fantastic!
Magical!!
Many Thanks, Nathan!"
V442,The Roslin Beach Hotel,Brilliantly done. Being so busy I wanted a venue that would just get it done. They did that and did it perfectly!!! Everyone commented on the brilliance of the Roslin!
V442,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"Thank you for all your hard work to make our day extra special and run so smoothly. We were both so relaxed the whole day, enjoying every moment. Amy is truly amazing at her job and just get 'it', she saw our vision and made it come to life. People complimented on the day and the Roslin team are at the top of their game."
V442,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"A very big heartfelt thank you for all your help and guidance, assistance and planning on our wedding day along with the lead up to it.

A special mention goes to our events manager Amy, you were a godsend from start to finish, thank you so much for your perfect organisation skills and helping run the wedding morning so calmly. Zed & Tate - thank you for all of your help and co-ordination during our wedding, evening and Sunday celebrations.

You all made our day perfect and complete, we could not have imagined holding our special day anywhere else."
V442,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"We can’t thank Roslin Beach Hotel enough for all of their help, everything went so smoothly and Amy helped us all to stay so calm!! We had such an amazing day and all of the members of staff could not do enough for all of us , the service was impeccable!! Couldn’t have asked for a better venue , the food was amazing and We were treated so well. Thanks again for all of your kindness , Amy and her team really made our day PERFECT !!"
V442,The Roslin Beach Hotel,Thank you so much to all management and staff for making my daughter and son-in-law's wedding day so special on 1st June. All your hard work and dedication showed through on the day. Thank you once again!
V442,The Roslin Beach Hotel,"We would like to say a big thank you to you and all the Roslin staff for making Ruth & Kelly's Wedding such a wonderful memorable day. Attention to detail was first class. DJ, flowers, the food, the waiting staff, in fact, the whole package couldn't have been better. Our guests were full of praise for this exceptional venue."
V443,Wivenhoe House,"we had a summer wedding July 2022. we had a garden ceremony.

from the day of enquiry to the day of the wedding, the team were fantastic, nothing was a problem, they were so willing to arrange, or sort out everytging.
We originally booked during covid but dates were moved due to health reasons, the team were more than happy to assist
they are great for advice and guidance for recommendations of suppliers that are loyal to them and reasonably priced also.

they were especially kind to my father who is in a wheelchair paralysed, Lionel one of the management team made sure a member of staff was always on hand helping him, to make the day as stress free for both of my parents, from the day before when they arrived to the moment they left with their luggage.
Lionel also organised the party of 20+ guests (including children) staying the night before the wedding the marquee for us all to have our evening meal together next to the restaurant, which was so kind.

the groom and i got ready separately in different areas of the hotel. i had a bridal team of 10 as did he, the wivenhoe team, were there continuously helping assisting and asking if we needed anything,

i had a particular set up of my décor for my tables, sweet cart etc, and lisa the events manager knew exactly my style and had it done perfectly. she was there early before she was expected helping and organising going above and beyond what she was needed to do, to make our day perfect.

the food was amazing, we had cocktails, canapes, wedding breakfast and the evening buffet, everyone was impressed with the high standard of food and service. (especially the guests who had special dietary requirements, who were very well looked after and felt like VIP’s)

lisa was a rock to us she was always there wherever i needed her, and she made our day flawless and perfect!

the reception team, were a great help, we had 20 rooms booked in the end, and i was constantly emailing for adding more and having a spreadsheet of who has booked etc.

the management team and the staff are wonderful
if we could afford it we would do it all over again a heartbeat! Was the happiest day of our lives, never stopped smiling or laughing x"
V443,Wivenhoe House,"From the initial meeting through to the day of our wedding Louise and Phoebe were excellent.
Nothing was too much trouble.
In the day of the wedding they dressed the venue to the highest standard and were so attentive, even helping my daughter when her speech became so emotional.
I cannot rate them high enough.
Stunning venue with the highest level of service.
Price was reasonable with so many extras included saving the stress of sorting discos and catering.
1000% the best choice we made.
Thank you Wivenhoe house for making our dream wedding come true."
V443,Wivenhoe House,"The Wivenhoe House Hotel, Colchester.
The whole experience from beginning to end was faultless.
Perfect day."
V443,Wivenhoe House,"Our wedding at wivenhoe house was everything we dreamed of!. The setting is beautiful and our wedding coordinator lisa, was just perfect. Price was very reasonable too! Amazing food and service :)"
V443,Wivenhoe House,"The wedding couldn’t have gone anymore amazing thanks to the team at Wivenhoe house. We was meant to get married in 2020, then 2021 and finally managed 2022. This was with massive support from the team also. The day went so amazing as they all went above and beyond for us."
V443,Wivenhoe House,"We got married nearly a year ago now 1/11/2019.
Wivenhoe house is truest beautiful and it I feel should be higher on people’s list for a wedding venue. The house is beautiful and I loved my wedding day. Katie was perfect as a planner and listened to us completely even my husbands idea of llamas!! Which we didn’t follow through with. The price was amazing for what we got included!!
The food was so great!! Especially the pudding and the evening buffet was the best I’d seen for the amount and selection. Would highly recommend the sliders. Overall I would give 10/10."
V443,Wivenhoe House,"I enjoyed most of it my wedding coordinator done well as well with all staff, room are clean decoration was lovely ,stunning areas ,food for my wedding breakfast is delicious all our guest ? love it ,we look after properly I highly recommend Wivenhoe house for wedding ."
V443,Wivenhoe House,Thank you so much for all your help in arranging our beautiful wedding reception. Everybody loved the day and we’re very impressed with your staff. They were attentive and approachable. We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Wivenhoe House to friends and family. We couldn’t be happier. The food was beautiful. We wish you all the best and thank you for all your patience. Hope to see you all again in the future.
V443,Wivenhoe House,"My husband and I got married here on the 30th June. We honestly couldn't have picked a better venue. We first visited this venue on a wedding open evening that they had, and it was incredibly busy. Yet, there was a member of staff on hand that could help and attend any questions/queries that we had. I'd spent a year planning our wedding, mainly with Katie Ballard. Her help and knowledge of wedding planning really was second to none. I'd never planned a wedding before so all of her help and guidance was very much appreciated. I had many visits to WHH throughout the year and each member of staff honestly couldn't do more for you. We did a menu tasting for our wedding day and was assisted by Ellie in the Brasserie. Her knowledge on all of the food options available was very impressive. The food was outstanding, we had 3 courses and 4 different dishes and each one was cooked and served to perfection. It's safe to say that Our wedding day was more than I could ever had imagined. It truly was perfect in every way and ran incredibly smoothly. Our guests also found the staff to be incredibly helpful and attentive, as they were helped with luggage, and allowing a few guests into their rooms a little earlier. I honestly couldn't recommend this venue enough. The house and grounds are breathtaking. And the staff are truly what make it the most wonderful, memorable experience."
V443,Wivenhoe House,"We booked Wivenhoe house bout a year before the wedding, we had amazing service from start to finish! Louise was responsive to all emails and incredibly helpful in sorting out all of the final details.

The day ran incredibly smoothly, all of the staff were fantastic."
V444,Stock Brook Country Club,We fell in love when we saw the venue for the very first time. It's beautiful and you can really go to town with decorations or keep it as simple as you like. The venue looked even better than I had pictured on my wedding day. We got so many compliments about the canapés and food at the wedding day as well. The only disappointing thing I found was that we couldn't access the bridal suite to get ready until 11am which is in the courtyard and where you can get amazing pictures. We had to start getting ready in a hotel nearby and then move there which was extremely stressful I begged Stock Brook to provide us with another room or access from 10 as that would've worked for us but they wasn't helpful at all if I'm honest. It's something I never really thought of until you are arranging timings for hair and make up etc and most people can access their prep room a lot earlier but the rest of the day made up for this and I really did have the best day.
V444,Stock Brook Country Club,"This venue was everything we had ever dreamed of and more. The venue is stunning and the space perfect. We got married in the rosewood suite which is a lovely long aisle to walk down, had the reception drinks in the gardens which was stunning and perfect for a hot sunny day. Our evening was upstairs in the ballroom and this was the whole reason we chose this venue. The space is perfect and the dance floor and glitter ball is so pretty. With the help of our venue decorator this room was breathtaking.

From start to finish our wedding co ordinator was on hand to answer any questions we had and helped us to ensure our day was perfect."
V444,Stock Brook Country Club,My husband and I booked our wedding with Stock Brook Manor in early 2019. I want to mention Joe who was our planner and contact at Stock Brook. He helped us plan a big wedding and then COVID happened. Joe helped us plan a smaller wedding and genuinely his help was invaluable. We are so thankful to Joe for working with us to make our day perfect. I would recommend Stock Brook Manor. Beautiful venue and amazing service from Joe and the other staff who work hard and are so friendly.
V444,Stock Brook Country Club,"We had the most fabulous day, Stock Brook is the best and most perfect wedding venue in the area. The venue speaks for itself and the food, service and wedding planning support are as brilliant. As a PA who is usually the bossy organiser, it was apparent from the outset that the team there have everything running perfectly so I felt more than happy taking a step back and concentrate on other areas of the wedding. I cannot thank the team including firstly Joe and then in the main Eleanor for everything they did. I couldn’t have dreamed of a better day."
V444,Stock Brook Country Club,"My husband and I got married at Stockbrook at the weekend, and had an absolutely fantastic day. All the staff from the cleaners to the waiting and bar staff were fantastic and work so hard to make it a perfect day. A particular mention to Joe Howgate who ensured everything on the day was perfect (which is no easy task with me being such a perfectionist). The food was amazing, and we had several comments that it was the best food people had tasted at a wedding. Overall, it was a fantastic day, thank you to all the staff, you’re AMAZING!! We will never forget our wonderful day!"
V444,Stock Brook Country Club,"From start to finish, everyone was great. Eleanor Pitts was our event planner, she went above and beyond at every opportunity. She helped us with the finer details that I wouldn't have even thought of. Venue was stunning, I wasn't aware of any faults, if there was any, we didn't have a clue. Eleanor helped make the day perfect, thank you sooo much."
V444,Stock Brook Country Club,"On our initial visit to Stockbrook Manor we instantly fell I love with the venue.
Joe, our coordinator was amazing throughout from when we had our initial planning meeting all the way to our final meeting. He was extremely thorough, patient & organised which really put our minds at ease.
Brides please bear with Joe as there were some periods of radio silence towards the wedding but this was due to the fact that Joe had a large number of weddings to coordinate. On our wedding day Joe was amazing, he knew our day like the back of his hand which really made the day perfect.
All our guests haven't stopped commenting on our wedding day, from the canapes to drinks, to the food and evening food! Guests who stayed at great blunts and the stables loved the accommodation. Thanks to all the staff at Stockbrook and especially Joe who we feel blessed to have as our coordinator.

From

The Frasers"
V444,Stock Brook Country Club,"It's versatility, the size, the use of both outdoor and indoor space and the decor (of both the venue plus the stunning Great Blunts House accommodation). We were also really impressed with the added extras that were included in the wedding package. We also really appreciated how flexible and open minded you were with our ideas with regards to themes and how we wanted the set up. The operation of the day couldn't have gone any better. You delivered everything we had planned and you didn't let me down in any aspect. One of my aunties was so happy with the quality of the food she wanted to thank the chef in person. Best wishes to you and all the fantastic team at Stock Brook."
V444,Stock Brook Country Club,"A massive thank you to all staff at Stock Brook Country Club for helping us bring our magical wedding day together! In particular Eleanor who has helped guide and accomodate us with all our planning and making our journey a smooth one! The venue itself is beautiful and spacious and looked elegant on the day thanks to Sophie, and her beautiful decorations. The guests enjoyed the food, drink and in particular spoke very highly of the stables accommodation we stayed at. We could not have asked for more and very pleased x"
V444,Stock Brook Country Club,"We would just like to say a massive thank you. From the minute we met you, we knew you had got this! From the bottom of our hearts it was truly the best day of our lives! All our guests haven't stopped commenting on our wedding day, from the canapes to drinks, to the food and evening food! Our guests said it's the best wedding food they have ever had. You made sure everthing was perfect for us. We can't thank you enough."
V445,Vaulty Manor,"Beautiful venue, lovely staff! Thank you for a wonderful day.
5 * service!"
V445,Vaulty Manor,"Beautiful day, thank you to the whole team for everything. Stunning venue and the staff were amazing. Everything ran smoothly and the whole wedding was better than we could have ever dreamt of. Thanks a million, it was a great day that we will remember for the rest of our lives."
V445,Vaulty Manor,"Very good day overall, everything went according to plan, food was lovely and staff friendly too."
V445,Vaulty Manor,"Wonderful wedding, thank you so much. The food was amazing and all help with the planning was great."
V445,Vaulty Manor,"Wonderful wedding, thank you so much. The food was amazing and all help with the planning was great."
V445,Vaulty Manor,Great professional and lovely staff. Food was delicious. Would highly recommend Vaulty Manor to anyone looking for a venue.
V445,Vaulty Manor,"Beautiful ceremony, gorgeous grounds and buildings. Staff worked extremely hard which helped make the day so wonderful."
V445,Vaulty Manor,"Staff were attentive and polite, rooms were very nice and breakfast the morning after was just right. Lovely venue."
V445,Vaulty Manor,"Very well hosted by the staff, would highly recommend this fantastic venue."
V445,Vaulty Manor,"Great food and staff, the venue is lovely and the bright sunshine made it even more special"
V446,Hutton Hall,"I just wanted to express my deepest gratitude to you both, and your amazing team of staff. From the day we booked, to enjoying breakfast the morning after the wedding, you have spoiled us with such a personal level of service. I honestly felt as if our wedding day was a luxury house party. It felt so intimate from start to finish. I've often said that, you wouldn't be greeted with the same level of personable service at a large cooperate venue. This is what made our wedding day so very special.
A special mention to the incredible Ray, who ensured our wedding day went smoothly, as well as keeping on top of the beautiful roaring fires! Also, a special mention to Marion, who ended up driving me and my Mum to the church when the rain scuppered my country walk plans. All our very dear friends and family, have complimented us on such a beautiful venue choice, and how it is possibly the best wedding they've ever been to.
So, thank you once again for all you did. May we wander the country lane for weekends to come, dreaming of our very special wedding day at Hutton Hall."
V446,Hutton Hall,"From the moment we first stepped foot into Hutton Hall we knew it was our dream venue! We truly had the wedding of our dreams.
From staying the night before, to getting ready in the morning, to dancing the wedding night away, every part of the day was perfect. We could not have wished for anything more!"
V446,Hutton Hall,"My husband and I had the most perfect wedding day at Hutton Hall. The owner, Paola, offers brilliant wedding packages and the catering outsourced to Limeberry, was outstanding. The bridal suite and guest bedrooms are luxurious and comfortable. The grounds are outstanding and brilliant for photographs. I couldn't recommend this venue more!"
V446,Hutton Hall,"Words cannot describe how beautiful Hutton Hall is.

As soon as we pulled through the gates we knew this venue was for us. We had already seen a few venues and this on made us go WOW!

Every single room in Hutton Hall was stunning!

Paola and Francesca were so lovely and we were so grateful to get to know them and their family.

We felt so at ease at the venue and had the most lovely overnight stay and breakfast as well.

I am hoping I can stay again in the future to remember the great memories of our wedding.

A magnificent venue, would highly recommend.

Mr and Mrs Hernaman xx"
V446,Hutton Hall,"Hutton Hall had everything we were looking for from a venue its stunning and has the wow factor plus for me with the beautiful village church based just at the back of the grounds, over the little wooden bridge it couldn't have been more perfect for a church wedding and then reception location!
We hired the bridal suite and bedrooms the night before the wedding so we had access to the light, bright and lovely preparation room for myself, mum and bridesmaids to get ready with an early start on the day.

The marquee set up for the wedding breakfast was beautiful overlooking the grounds and the fountains and with the sides up as it was a nice day was just perfect.

I was initially a little worried about the space as we had 100 guests in the day time, and 30+ in the evening, but I shouldn't have been concerned as it worked brilliantly and never felt overcrowded. The dancefloor even though it's a separate room was constantly busy all night and the courtyard and main hall and bars were perfect for people to mingle!

We had so many compliments from friends and family about what a great venue and day it was and we were honestly thrilled.

The Georgian Manor house with its high ceilings and beautiful features was ideal as we wanted light and airy, with a feeling of glamour / grandeur. I have to say it had all this, while also feeling intimate.
We fell in love with Hutton Hall straight away, and booked very quickly after our first viewing. Francesca and Paula are brilliant and answered all my many questions and worked with us to coordinate the day. They also work with a great selection of their tried and tested suppliers who are not only nice people but deliver a top class service.

I cannot recommend Hutton Hall enough, and if you have any doubts over the suppliers included in the packages, we can confirm Limeberry catering provided a slick service the food was delicious, hot and well presented with a lovely team of waiting staff and DJ AJ (Paul G) was fantastic keeping the dancefloor busy all night too. They have such a great team on board here, which makes life so much easier as a bride, if I'd have known how great it was going to be, i wouldn't have wasted less time worrying about the little things!

Thank you so much for the best day of our lives.

V446,Hutton Hall,We had the best day at Hutton Hall. The building and grounds are beautiful and all of the staff are lovely! Paola helped us organise everything and answered all of our questions promptly. She supported us throughout the delays due to covid and was very understanding. We had the most magical day and Hutton Hall made it run smoothly and stress free! Definitely recommend.
V446,Hutton Hall,"Seamless day in the most beautiful venue. From the moment I viewed Hutton Halls website i knew it would be our venue. The whole building is stunning - from the blue room to the bridal prep room to the grounds.

It is run by the two loveliest ladies - Paola and Francesca who are always on hand to answer (my many!) questions.

The evening before myself and my bridesmaids stayed at the venue which I recommend doing as it made the build up so special. Paola bought us a nice cold bottle of Prosecco up and a lovely cup of tea for me (my favourite!). We ordered in food and had a really relaxed luxurious night in their beautiful bedrooms - the huge bridal suite bath is a must!

The day of the wedding was seamless. Everyone who came said it was the most beautiful venue they’d been to. The entrance hall when you walk in is breathtaking and there are many silk flower arrangements around helping the decor of the day look extra stunning.

The food on the day was spectacular. We used Limeberry who are a preferred supplier of the venue and I’m extremely fussy on food but wow - they really blew us away! The food was plentiful (nothing worse than being hungry at a wedding but no chance here!) and Angie who ran the catering side was super helpful and made sure we had everything we needed. The dishes were made gluten free with no issue and were delicious.

Our day was just everything we had dreamed of and more - the photos are breathtaking. I can’t thank Paola enough for pulling together the day of my dreams and being so friendly and helpful along the way.

If you’re thinking of holding your wedding here it’ll be the best choice you’ve made. It was a fairytale day"
V446,Hutton Hall,Paola was a great host when showing me and my fiance around the venue. I can't wait to visit here again and get married here next year! Thanks
V446,Hutton Hall,"Hutton Hall was everything we were looking for in our venue, and did not disappoint on the day. It was absolutely stunning, offering we wanted very conveniently located next to each other: huge and luxurious bridal suite and guest rooms, outside ceremony area, beautiful gardens for champagne reception and garden games, stunning marquee for the dinner, spacious areas inside for dancing, seating areas and two bars, and beautiful fairy light courtyard for our evening pizza. The team behind Hutton Hall are what make this venue truly ideal though. We felt supported and in very safe hands throughout the planning process and on the day, and truly felt like the whole team genuinely wanted our day to run perfectly...and it really did! You won't be disappointed!"
V446,Hutton Hall,"The bridal party arrived just after 10 o’clock to be greeted with a lovely smile and hug from Paola. We were left to get on with our preparations. But someone was on hand to help if needed.
What a fantastic venue. Lovely people. Fabulous grounds. We didn’t want to leave. Thank You to everyone at Hutton Hall for a great day."
V447,Smeetham Hall Barn,"If you are looking for a romantic barn setting Smeetham hall barn is the one…we can not thank Sophie and the team at Smeetham hall for being nothing but incredible through the whole process of planning our wedding and to the most amazing day we could have ever wished for…what we would give to relive the day all over again

Thank you once again for being so amazing

Mr & Mrs Field (Lucy & Rob) 05.04.25 X"
V447,Smeetham Hall Barn,"We first found came across Smeetham Hall Barn 7 years ago. After looking at other venues we kept being drawn back here. The venue and grounds are absoutely stunning. Sophie has been amazing from the very beginning, nothing was too much trouble even arranging for my nan to come along in her wheelchair which meant so much to us. Our day could not have gone any smoother. Our wedding breakfast was fantastic, a lot of guests complimented the food and the service from Splinters Caterers. We could not have asked for a more perfect wedding day!"
V447,Smeetham Hall Barn,"We fell in love with Smeetham Hall Barn from the moment we pulled up in the car. The venue is absolutely beautiful. Sophie was fantastic, from the very first email to arrange a viewing, right up to the big day. She took the stress out of planning our wedding and allowed us to simply enjoy the process. Nothing was ever too much trouble, and emails were replied to within the day. Our wedding day was the best day, and this is thanks to
Sophie and the team at the beautiful Smeetham Hall Barn. The only downside was that the wedding flew by so quickly; we wish we could relive it all over again."
V447,Smeetham Hall Barn,"Smeetham Hall Barn was the perfect venue for us. It was the only venue we viewed and an easy decision - it had everything we were looking for. It certainly lived up to our hopes and dreams. The barn and setting are naturally beautiful, without requiring loads of additional decoration. Their twinkly fairy lights set the scene perfectly. Having so many scenic spots for a variety of photograph opportunities is ideal. Our experience from booking to our big day was seamless. We were always kept informed and knew we’d hear back quickly if we had any queries. Sophie helped so much behind the scenes to ensure everything went to plan, she consistently eased any neves and went above and beyond for us. Splinters the caterers who are included within our wedding package were brilliant. The wedding breakfast was delicious and all our guests were very complimentary. Thank you to all at Smeetham Hall Barn and Splinters for being part of our perfect day. We loved every second and will forever hold the fondest memories 🤍"
V447,Smeetham Hall Barn,"Sophie and Victoria were absolutely brilliant in the lead up to our wedding, they were always ready to answer my many many questions 😂 They were so organised and made the day run perfectly. Tom behind the bar was brilliant too.
We’ve had so many compliments on how beautiful the venue was and how amazing the day was. We are both so grateful to the whole team at Smeetham Hall for everything they did for our perfect day. Would highly recommend!!"
V447,Smeetham Hall Barn,"Smeetham is such a perfect place to get married. The team supported us every step of the way, even when we were asking so many questions, and they were always so happy to help. Everyone is so kind and they understood our vision for the day. Everything went so perfectly and I couldn’t have ask for a better day! Thank you so so much!"
V447,Smeetham Hall Barn,"They say it’s the people who make your wedding, and that couldn't be more true. We were not only surrounded by family and friends but also by a team who truly felt like part of our celebration. A huge thank you to the entire Smeetham Hall Barn team, but with a special mention to Bridget, who welcomed us so warmly on our first visit that Smeetham instantly felt like home, and left us with no question that this was the venue for us. And to Sophie, thank you for all of your support throughout our planning journey, for always being just an email away with answers to our questions, for welcoming us at open days, and for being such a friendly presence on both our setup and wedding day whilst making sure everything went smoothly - we couldn’t have asked for more.

Smeetham Hall Barn itself provided the perfect setting for our autumnal wedding. Having worked in events ourselves, we were eager to find a venue with authentic charm, not a corporate feel. After viewing several other ‘barns,’ we started to wonder if we’d have to compromise, but Smeetham exceeded our hopes - it was everything we’d been searching for and more. With its unique, rustic character and all the amenities needed for a perfect wedding day, Smeetham Hall Barn truly stands out, and we feel very lucky to have stumbled across such a beautiful venue, less than half an hour from home. We were given complete flexibility to customise the space to suit our theme and add personal touches, with helpful recommendations for suppliers along the way. Having a full day to set up allowed us to truly enjoy the experience, extending our celebrations and ensuring everything looked just as we’d envisioned, without the stress or time pressures - a rarity in the wedding industry.

Looking back, our only wish is that we could do it all over again - it was truly the perfect day. We couldn’t recommend Smeetham Hall Barn more highly to anyone searching for their wedding venue."
V447,Smeetham Hall Barn,"Picking a venue is just….woah. It’s a LOT. Except when it’s not, because you’re made to feel like centre stage from the outset. We’d viewed a few venues which were starting to blur into one and a feeling a bit overwhelmed with it all. So if it’s the people that make a wedding, you can definitely include the Smeetham Hall team with that.
From the open evening, to booking and run through to the event (and MANY emails in between) they were only too happy to help. And encourage some out of the box fun with it.
SO many positive vibes from our guests about the venue itself from the ceremony on the lawn, the outdoor drinks reception and the barn itself for the wedding breakfast. Each element creating it’s own little piece of the day.
Great vendor partners on hand too to make sorting details like the food, DJ, lighting etc a breeze.
Thank you Sophie and Victoria.
James and Laressa Human"
V447,Smeetham Hall Barn,"WOW…where do we start! Firstly, we planned our wedding from Australia and from our initial video call with Bridget we knew there was something very special about Smeetham Hall Barn and we were in safe hands. Sophie - you were amazing, quickly getting back to my questions over the year and ensuring everything ran smoothly on the day. Tom went above and beyond for the evening bar, honouring a special request we had for an evening drink - so incredible! The whole process was seamless and we couldn’t be anymore grateful to everyone at Smeetham Hall Barn for making ensuring we had the best day of our lives, which we truly did! Cannot recommend SHB enough - thank you everyone, we want to do it all over again ! ♥️"
V447,Smeetham Hall Barn,"Our wedding at Smeetham Hall Barn on 10th June 2024 was absolutely perfect! The venue’s elegant charm and stunning grounds provided a beautiful backdrop for our special day.

The staff were exceptional, handling every detail with professionalism and care, allowing us to truly enjoy our celebration.

Smeetham Hall Barn offered the perfect mix of beauty, excellent service, and a warm ambiance. We couldn’t have asked for a better place to celebrate our wedding and highly recommend it to any couple looking for an unforgettable venue."
V448,Hedsor House,"After getting engaged on July 1st, 2023, I used Hitched to find local wedding venues and discovered Hedsor. From the moment we found Hedsor, we knew no other venue could compare (even without visiting in person).

We arranged a virtual tour with Kate and instantly felt a connection. She was professional, knowledgeable, and friendly, making us feel confident that we were in very safe hands. Although we initially planned to marry in 2025 due to other commitments in 2024, we found a rare opportunity to get married at Hedsor on December 29th, 2023. What started as a hypothetical possibility quickly became reality after talking with Kate and Hedsor's preferred suppliers. We decided to take the plunge (yes, we are mad!).

Since Hedsor's packages were unavailable during the Christmas break, we opted to dry-hire the house and worked with a mix of preferred and self-sourced suppliers. Organising everything in just four months was crazy, but Kate was always there to support and guide us through the process. We truly could not have done it without her and the wider Hedsor team!

As for the wedding day itself—just WOW. It was perfect from start to finish, exceeding our very high expectations. The house was beautifully decorated for Christmas, adding an extra touch to this already stunning and special place. Trish and the team ran the day like a military operation, allowing my husband and me to fully relax and savour every moment.

Thank you to everyone at Hedsor for making our wedding day the best day of our lives. It turned out to be even more than our dream day!"
V448,Hedsor House,My dream wedding in our dream venue. From start to finish Hedsor house was everything I dreamt of and more. The staff were amazing and they made our day stress free!
V448,Hedsor House,"Hedsor House.... Why wouldn't you choose Hedsor!? From the get go Hedsor ticked all of our boxes for the show-stopper Wedding we imagined. The bonus is that you have exclusive use of the mansion & we opted to dry hire the day before our wedding and had a pre-wedding celebration with guests staying in the house - it was amazing!

For our wedding day we chose the 1776 package and all the suppliers included were phenomenal, we also used suppliers from the preferred supplier list who were all great too.

The team at Hedsor are just brilliant, we cannot thank them enough for their quick responses and never saying no to all of the ideas we had.

Thank you Hedsor for the Wedding of our dreams, Stefan & Katie xx"
V448,Hedsor House,"Best wedding venue I have ever found, and I’ve been looking for a very, very long time! (Long engagement). Their packages are phenomenal value for money for what’s on the market, their open days are like a dream (honestly), and their customer service is absolutely excellent. I have been in talks with Hedsor on and off for a number of years as we opted for a long engagement and wanted to save for this incredible venue. They have been incredible the whole time, have never pressured us to book, and always been so accommodating and patient with our questions over the last few years. They have supported us every step of the way in such a non-pushy way, and we have now finally secured our wedding date with them and I couldn’t be happier. The packages take care of almost everything, taking the pressure and stress out of organising numerous different vendors (flowers, cake, food, decorations, RJ etc) there is almost nothing not covered or catered for within their wedding packages.

I honestly have not one bad word to say about Hedsor and the team. Having been in communication with them for such a long time, I can say they are consistent, reliable and lovely to work with - 10/10 for everything so far!"
V448,Hedsor House,"We recently had our amazing wedding at Hedsor House and did one of their signature packages the ‘1776’ package. We honestly had the best day ever and our only complaint was it went too fast!!
All the Hedsor team were absolutely brilliant and couldn’t do enough for us!
We’ve had so many lovely compliments from our guests on the stunning house as well as how smoothly the day ran and a lot of our guests have said it was the best wedding they have ever been too!
We would thoroughly recommend Hedsor House to anyone looking for a wedding venue and once you set eyes on the stunning house you’ll see exactly why!
But not only is it an absolutely beautiful venue but all of the staff are so warm and welcoming too making it the perfect venue!
I wish we could do it all over again!!!"
V448,Hedsor House,"We simply cannot fault anything to do with our Wedding at Hedsor. Our wedding was initially booked for December 2020, and had to make the decision to postpone to December 2021. Jennie and the Team could not have been more supportive. In the run up to the day, Jennie was on hand for all of my questions no matter how big or small.
When the day finally came, all of the staff were excellent. A massive shoutout to Matt who made everything simply flawless. I didn't have to lift a finger.
For a truly special wedding venue, Hedsor will never disappoint."
V448,Hedsor House,"Dream wedding venue with the best staff. Stayed here for two nights, and couldn’t be more pleased. We adore everyone at Hedsor house. Thank you for making our experience a memorable one. We love you guys!"
V448,Hedsor House,"Dear Jennie and the Hedsor staff,

There are truly no words to describe how thankful we are for you all. Our wedding day was perfect and that’s all thanks to you.
Jennie, thank you for always listening to our wants for our day and your speedy response times. It always made planning from across the pond so much easier.
I never had any doubts about how smoothly our wedding day would go because I knew I was in good hands.
On the day of everyone commented on how helpful the whole staff was. All of our guests were blown away by literally everything about Hedsor.
I will forever recommend Hedsor and your team. I wish we could relive the day basically every day, Hedsor is the most magical place.
Thank you so much for making our day so magical.
Any couple getting married is so lucky they have incredible people like you making sure their day is perfect.
We hope you all had a Merry Christmas and a wonderful start to the New Year!
Much love,
Mara & Patrick
PS. Thank you for the beautiful cutting board and bottles of champagne. We get lots of compliments on the beautiful cutting board!"
V448,Hedsor House,"Hi Jennie, Katie and the Hedsor team,

Thank you so so much for everything you’ve done for us. We cannot thank you enough and also really appreciate your patience with us when going through the visa and rooming process. My mother and father in law were able to be there after flying in literally the night before and we could not have asked for a more perfect day.

Everyone absolutely loved the venue and we received so many compliments.

All the house managers were absolutely brilliant and just wanted to say a special thank you to Vic who walked me down from my bridal room and gave me some fantastic calming words of advice before I made my entrance. He was absolutely lovely and cannot thank the team enough for everything on the day and on the morning after.

The official pictures haven’t been released yet however I thought I would send you some casual ones from the day. I will of course send you them when they come out.

Thank you again and we hope you had a lovely Christmas and New Year break!

Very best,
Aiysha and Rehan"
V448,Hedsor House,"Dear Natasha & the wonderful Hedsor team,

Thank you so much for all you did to help make our special day truly unforgettable.

Since the first day we visited, we knew Hedsor House would make the most stunning venue and the house and gorgeous views took our guests breath away. It will forever hold the most incredible memories of our most perfect wedding day.
We are so grateful for all your guidance, assistance and professionalism leading up to the day. We felt we were in the best hands every step of the way and it was always such a joy to read your kind and thoughtful emails.
We are only sad that the fun of the wedding planning with you is over and want to do it all again. We will cherish Hedsor House forever and we cannot wait to be able to visit again soon.
Thank you again!

Lots of love,
Alice & David xxx"
V449,That Amazing Place,"We held a small family wedding (about 40 people) here and 'wow' the place and the team, particularly Angie, certainly were 'amazing'! The main house is beautiful and quirky and set in beautiful grounds, whilst the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. It was spotlessly clean and felt very exclusive with it being sited away from neighbouring properties. We felt the setting was idyllic for our wedding and would certainly recommend it to others."
V449,That Amazing Place,"We got married at That Amazing Place on 9/11/24
What can i say! 100% have your wedding here, you will not be disappointed. From first meeting Angie and the team in 2023, all the way through they were fantastic. We stayed in the beautiful cottage the night before. Our wedding morning, service, meal, evening everything was perfect.
Nothing was to much trouble, Angie and the team
Styled the venue perfectly, following my exact instructions and more. Words can not express how grateful we are for such a fantastic support team.
The venue is beautiful, it truly has its own personality. Every single guest commented the same.
Thank you so much Angie, Louise and team. You made our wedding exactly how we had dreamed xx"
V449,That Amazing Place,We got married at That Amazing Place in august 2024 and what an AMAZING place it is. The staff were all so friendly and An extra big thankyou to Angie and Louise who went above and beyond making sure our day was just how we wanted. Both Such lovely ladies and nothing was too much. Highly recommend this amazing place to everyone. Thankyou Keighley&James x
V449,That Amazing Place,"WOW - That amazing place.
Firstly, it certainly lives up to its name & more.


From the moment we booked to have our wedding day at TAP, we knew it was going to be special!

All the months of planning, Angie & Louise have been there every step of the way. Angie was always there on the end of an email or a phone call. To help, guide or advise!


We had our beautiful wedding day on Thursday 24th October and it was just incredible.
That amazing place, really is a special place and we feel so lucky and grateful to have got to have our wedding day there.
From the beautiful characteristisc house, to the beautiful marquee to the beautiful lake and outside grass it really has it all!

Every single one of the staff cannot do enough for you, Paul & all the team are just the loveliest people and we’re so friendly and helpful with anything we needed.




The actual day ran so smoothly with not a single hiccup and I truly beleive that was due to Angie & Louise’s efficiency! They were amazing from morning to night and constantly checked we were ok and if we needed anything.


We would reccomend this venue to anyone.. and if we could do our wedding again, we would do it here again & again.




We will always look back on our day knowing the venue was a pivotal part and with a big smile!


Thank you for everything!
All our Love,
Mr & Mrs Ackerman xxx"
V449,That Amazing Place,"Where do I start... me and my now wife got married at ""That amazing place"" and not to sound too corny, but it was amazing!

The decor was both elegant and warm, whilst the space was perfect for our cosy big day!

I don't think I could rate this place any higher, but the staff made our special day all the more magical! They offered a number of wedding packages which we were able to tailor to perfectly suit what we had dreamt of... they were also so accommodating to all of our needs and implemented them fantastically.

The venue has good disabled access, and the staff had ramps they were all too willing to move around, which helped my wheelchair using mum fully experience our big day to the fullest.

We chose to stay the night, and accommodation was clean and luxurious, not to mention the delicious breakfast the morning after.

This all added up to a 10 out of 10 day and lifelong memory, a wondrous experience for me and my new wife."
V449,That Amazing Place,We got married here in 2024. We had the most amazing day all coordinated by Angie and her amazing team! Everything about the venue was perfect and how we wanted it. We had our family dogs there too to top it all off!
V449,That Amazing Place,"We knew from when we first visited That Amazing Place that we wanted to get married there and on the day the venue really was everything we wanted it to be. Angie and the team we so great and made sure we had everything we needed.
All our guests loved the day and the place and we’re so happy with how everything turned out.
It was such a magical day and we wouldn’t have changed a thing!"
V449,That Amazing Place,"I honestly cannot recommend That Amazing Place more! Angie, Louise and the rest of the staff were incredible from start to finish. We first met Louise and Angie in February 2023 when they showed us around and we instantly knew we wanted to get married here. They couldn’t have made the experience more straightforward and stress free for us. On the day, everything was taken control of exactly how I would have wanted and everything ran smoothly thanks to Angie and Louise. Who are both so lovely and welcoming! The venue was spot on, the house is beautiful and the marquee was perfect for a party. Louise even drove us over the grass in a golf buggy to make sure we got some pictures outside without getting too wet due to the rain!
Absolutely loved staying in the wedding lodge the night before, stunning house and got everything you’d need (Angie and Louise came to say hello the night before also making me feel so relaxed about it all). Thank you so so much for everything you did for us and for making our day so perfect. Couldn’t have wished for a better venue. Lives up to its name!"
V449,That Amazing Place,"We visited a few venues before That Amazing Place, but when we met Louise and walked around the venue we knew straight away that this was the place for us.
We loved their relaxed style and felt we could really have the wedding that we wanted and it did not disappoint.
Angie helped us to organise our day and used her experience to help guide us into making some sensible decision. I really felt as though she listened to what we wanted and was willing to accommodate our plans.

On the day it was the wedding we had dreamed of. both Angie, Louise and the TAP team were on hand to make our day perfect. They beautifully set up the venue and went above and beyond to make sure we were happy throughout the day.
I couldn't be more thankful to them for helping to create our perfect wedding. I will forever be grateful to them."
V449,That Amazing Place,"Angie and Paul helped us plan the perfect wedding for us. It was the most amazing day, just what we wanted. Calm, chilled, relaxed, no stress and everyone was happy. They are highly recommended! We can not thank them enough!
Highly recommended!"
V450,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"Down Hall was our chosen venue for our wedding day in August - we had a wonderful day and the team did a great job looking after us and our guests.
We worked with Zoe as our wedding coordinator who was fantastic and responsive to our requests and communication as we planned the wedding in a short space of time in 5 months!
The chef was great and modified the menu to suit our special fusion wedding. The results were amazing with all our guests commenting on how wonderful the food was (my worst nightmare averted of guests feeling hungry or having a poor food experience!).
The whole experience with Down Hall was great. The hotel was very busy for the weekend over the summer which did not affect our wedding day itself as had a team dedicated to us. We also had a family afternoon tea arranged the day before instead of a rehearsal dinner which was also amazing with great service in our private room.
We hope to return for our first anniversary!"
V450,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"The summary I would give our wedding is that the venue is stunning however the wedding coordinators and bar staff failed on several occasions to deliver the wedding we had planned or paid for.

I really did not want to micro-mange my own wedding but this meant things didn’t go to plan. Luckily as we had evidence in writing we did receive compensation for this however that doesn’t change what happened on the day.


Here’s what happened …


Planning Issues

We emailed our final planning information 2 days prior to our final wedding planning meeting. We then had our final planning meeting with Tracy who said everything was okay and on-track. 10 days later she then admitted she had not read the documents at the time of the final planning meeting and had now found a problem. There was a problem, which was my misunderstanding, and we resolved this however this is a great example of the level of service that we received.

We had asked (thankfully via email) if we could have a musician outside during reception drinks and were told we were so we booked one. When we then visited Down Hall we were told we were not allowed a musician. As we could provide the email from them saying we could have a musician they allowed us to have one but I would recommend to any potential couples to get all communication in writing as you may need to provide what you have been told!

These are just two of several fustrating interactions we had during planning!


Time Management

The time management of the wedding coordinators is terrible. We were left waiting on every occasion that we met with them, sometimes up to 45minutes with no idea what was going on. On our wedding day we were left waiting in the reception room for 20minutes wondering again how long we would be waiting with many things to do!


Wedding Ceremony Music

We provided a detailed run-though of the wedding ceremony and when music was meant to be played (nothing complicated, pre-wedding, entrance, signing and exit songs).

- The pre-wedding ceremony music was not setup by the wedding coordinator as promised and was playing through the ipad and not speakers when the Groom arrived.
- Tracy then proceeded mid-way through the ceremony to randomly start playing the second signing music song before realising she was drowning out proceedings and switching it off.
- The Ceremony came to an end and everyone was asked to stand and out their hands together (this took quite a while as my Grandpa is disabled) despite this delay and being given a script in advance Tracy then totally missed starting the exit music until we were 3/4 of the way down the aisle.

The team did offer us compensation for this.


Horsebox Bar

We had paid £500 to reserve the terrace and horsebox bar. When we asked the Food & Beverage team to open the horsebox bar back up after the meal they had to apologise and say that there was a mix up and no staff had been booked and this was not possible.

After the wedding we then complained to the Revenue Manager who claimed that this was agreed with us and this was reflected on the function sheet which we received prior to the wedding … this was a totally untrue!

We then (rather embarrassingly for them) sent them their own function sheet and highlighted the line which said “horsebox bar and terrace after meal service”. After agreeing that both the contract and function sheet said this should be open they offered us compensation. Once again showing the importance of getting everything confirmed in writing.


Prosecco

We brought our own drink and did corkage. During the post wedding drinks I went to the horsebox bar to get a Prosecco to then be told that was the last glass. I was surprised given how much we had brought. I found two bottles in the dining room and took them to the horsebox bar. These were drunk and then guests started buying their own drinks as a result of being told this was finished.

I was then very disappointed to be handed back 8 bottles of Prosecco when we checked out. When I complained about this the Revenue Manger said the guests were drinking G&T which does not answer the complaint at all and again reflects the level of service we received.


Summary

In summary, the venue is stunning however from reading previous reviews it appears that a completely new wedding team are at Down Hall. I would only recommend this as a place to get married if you are going to micro-manage your wedding coordinator, get everything in writing, and don’t trust the function sheet as this is not guarantee things will happen."
V450,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"Wow what an amazing wedding we had at downhall, the venue was absolutely stunning and the team were amazing and always there for you along the whole journey. I could ask for more the whole day was an absolute dream and that wouldn't have been possible if not for the amazing team. Thank you so so much xxx"
V450,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"Down hall were amazing for mine & my new husbands wedding day! The whole day went so well and it was so so organised I couldn’t of felt in safer hands! Our wedding was cancelled twice due to the pandemic, and down hall were so accommodating in moving us we couldn’t complain! The only thing that went wrong was the music when I walked down the aisle temporarily stopped twice, I was so nervous for the day, I wanted the ground to swallow me up. But it wasn’t anyones fault it was just a technical glitch! But otherwise Becky, Imran & Julie especially we’re SO AMAZING I couldn’t of wished for a better wedding team! Loved it so much I’d do it all over again! And everyone commented on how accommodating & beautiful the venue was and how delicious the food was 😍 Even down the the Easter egg hunt the hotel had on the next morning for the children! It was absolutely perfect! You can tell they have all the experience! Loved it! We can’t wait to come back to stay for afternoon tea, some lush dinner & a spa day 😍"
V450,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"My husband and I got married at Down Hall in December 21. Covid cases just started to get bad again and even though Stu and I were a panicked mess in the days leading up to it, Becky, Imran and their dedicated team calmed every concern and we had the most incredible day. They are flexible, accommodating and the most reliable people I have ever met. No request was too much and they did absolutely everything they could to ensure that everything went ahead without fault. We met with the organisers the day before to discuss final details and they had everything written down and ready before we opened our mouths, even down the sticking down the sign on our post box. The smallest touches made the day magical and their attention to detail is unmatched. Because of them, we have the most fantastic memories of our day. Thank you so so much xx"
V450,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,We had the most magical wedding day! Would recommend this venue to everyone
V450,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"The Down Hall wedding team worked wonders for us when planning our special day. They’re caring, efficient and clearly have years of experience in organising weddings - the value of which cannot be underestimated. Organising a wedding in 2020 has at times felt like trying to pitch a tent in a storm only for it to be blown away given lockdown and a series of changes to wedding regulations. The team helped us to navigate the various covid regulations without letting them dominate our special day and did so with the utmost sensitivity.

The grounds and function rooms are stunning and offer a gorgeous backdrop for your ceremony, pictures and celebrations. The rooms are spacious and the Liddel suite in particular is a treasure trove of a room with all sorts of surprises including a romantic bathtub with views across the grounds. The food was delicious and the day was a success despite such difficult circumstances. Thank you Down Hall. We would not hesitate to recommend you for anyone planning a wedding in the future!"
V450,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"We got engaged in January then went to down hall on valentine a day I had been there before to stay and just knew I’d love to get married there so booked a meeting with a Julie and booked straight away the whole experience was perfect so professional and easy Julie was the reason for that she made it stress free . Our wedding day was perfect everything ran smoothly and just how I’d imagined we stayed from sat till Monday. Toast master Simon was amazing run the day brilliantly .
I would encourage anyone to get Married at Down hall perfect venue."
V450,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"Right from the start we was not even sure if we could have this fantastic venue, due to our small and intimate wedding. But to our delight, Down Hall tailored and accommodated our needs every step of the way. We must say all of the staff were brilliant in every way possible.
The food was perfect, and presented beautifully, and our guests loved it.
My husband and I had the most magical day. Once again we would like to give a massive thank you to all of the staff at Down Hall, for giving us a day that we will never forget."
V450,Down Hall Hotel & Spa,"We couldn't have asked for a better day. All our friends and family are still talking about what an amazing day it was. Venue looked amazing, service was excellent and as for the beef it was exquisite.
From the moment we stepped into the venue it felt special and the wedding team made everything so easy building up to the day and on the day.
It was so good we want to do it again every year!"
V451,Newland Hall,"I'm not even sure where to begin but wow! We fell in love with this wedding venue just over a year before our wedding day and we looked at other venues but we kept comparing them all to Newland Hall. From the get go we had amazing email and phone calls with Lucy and Kelly. No question or query wasn't welcomed which I think any bride appreciates. We were able to meet with Lucy 5 weeks before our wedding day and also a few months before to refresh our memory and see the venue again before our big day which again felt just right and we picked our venue right. We were able to drop off decorations the day before our wedding (stuff for the tables, post box, seating plan, welcome sign etc) and Lucy as always greeted with us with such warmth and I think knowing Lucy was going to be there on the day made me feel so calm. Now the day. WOW. Thanks to Lucy she took what I had in mind for the tables, signs etc and made it perfect (better than I could) again no question or request was too big to ask. I had so many guests tell me how much they loved the venue and I'm hoping I can return to Newland Hall as a guest to take it all in again. The food was amazing and all of the staff working on my wedding were lovely (kept making sure I had eaten and I had a drink) If you're thinking of Newland Hall do it! I wouldn't change a thing. I want to do it all over again! Also want to mention the DJ was amazing! Music wasn't too loud which was good and he judged how well the songs were going to decide what to play next and he had a lot of patience for me as I had requested quite a lot music. I was also able to choose the music for after the wedding and dinner part which felt really personal."
V451,Newland Hall,"This Gem is tucked away in a quiet location in Chelmsford and I am glad that my partner found it randomly. When we went to visit the venue, we was blown away and very stunned at the beauty and peacefulness of the location.
The staffs, Kelly and Katerina were very professional, helpful and friendly. They truly made our day feel special. The venue was very flexible as we had to reschedule our wedding due to covid-19 restrictions on wedding. They also listened to us and our requests and tried their best to accommodate them within their capability.
We had an amazing day and thank you for making our day special!
Cloudier and Ryan"
V451,Newland Hall,"From the moment we arrived at Newland Hall for the Open day we knew we had found the perfect venue for our wedding and the actual event proved that right, and more.
Kelly and her team at Newland Hall were brilliant; in the run up to the event they were accommodating and flexible to our needs and on the day itself the whole thing ran beautifully making it a fabulous day for all involved, the ceremony was absolutely lovely and the reception and buffet that followed turned in to the relaxed and friendly garden party atmosphere that we had hoped for.

Thank you all again for a fantastic day.

V451,Newland Hall,We got married outside on 21.09.19 as the weather was perfect.! All our last minute changes were catered for by Katerina who was brilliant throughout. The venue is so pretty and perfect for what we wanted. The bbq food was lovely and the whole day flowed perfectly. Would definitely recommend.
V451,Newland Hall,"Amazing Venue, perfect for the intimate wedding we were looking for. Beautiful surroundings and 1st class service from the staff. Would highly recommend for anyone looking for a picturesque location. We married outside with the BBQ option which was amazing too! Thank you, Newland Hall!

V451,Newland Hall,"The most perfect wedding Venue, got married here on Saturday and had the best day, people could not stop complimenting the venue and the food and all the staff it was amazing. We had Fran as our wedding co-ordinator, and she was amazing and done such an amazing job. Everything went so well and it’s because of her, she set it all up just how I wanted it and she made sure I didn’t have to think about anything on the day. We had a lot of guests, 150 during the day and more in the evening, so she had her work cut out, but she really did amazingly, you could see how hard she worked. Thank you so much Newland Hall and most importantly Fran she was amazing. Couldn’t recommend this venue and Fran highly enough.
Becky & Daniel Harrington"
V451,Newland Hall,"We got married here on May Bank Holiday Monday and we could not be happier!
We chose Newland Hall because of the exclusivity, the beautiful house and outside space! We were married outside under the gazebo which we were able to decorate with flowers and sashes. The grounds are absolutely gorgeous, with plenty of photo opportunities, in and around the house, marquee and the nearby fields and lakes! The food was delicious and the guests were full of compliments! Our wedding planner, Fran, was absolutely amazing, she set the venue up and dealt with everything, making it completely stress free, for us and our guests! Nothing was too much! Thank you!
It’s a shame it’s all over, but thank you for being so accommodating! We would definitely recommend.
Jasmine & Dan Banks"
V451,Newland Hall,"WOW .....! What can I say?? We got married at Newland Hall on the 01.09.19 and it was the best day of our lives. I firstly want to thank Katerina our wedding coordinator for all her hard work in the lead up to the wedding and her organisational skills on the day really shone through, she was amazing from start to finish making our day even more special. I would also like to thank the director Simon for all his help in the run up to our wedding also. The food and service were second to none and everyone commented on the food. It was a truly amazing experience from start to finish. The staff were attentive and friendly and kept the drinks flowing so everyone could enjoy themselves. There were no long waits at the bar either which kept things flowing. A massive, massive thank you to everyone at Newland Hall for making our day that little bit more special, they really made us feel so special.
Mr & Mrs Swinney"
V451,Newland Hall,"Everyone who attended the wedding and reception said they had a fabulous time and dealing with Newland Hall and yourself has been a very thorough and enjoyable experience.

Thank you for everything you did and also to all of the other staff who helped make our wedding day such a great day."
V451,Newland Hall,"Thank you so much for everything, our day couldn’t have gone any better! We had so many guests saying to us what an amazing venue it is and also how great the staff are, and we obviously completely agree with them, we definitely made the best choice!"
V452,Creeksea Place,"We knew Creeksea would be the venue for us when we first happened to see pictures of the Manor and grounds online some years ago. From the moment we arrived for our appointment to meet with Claire who was helpful, friendly and flexible to try and make our day exactly as we wanted it. We kept in contact with Claire for any questions and checking ideas until we were allocated Carly as our coordinator. Carly was absolutely wonderful, answering texts and calls whenever things came up and reassured us to no end about the weather! Carly’s knowledge of the venue and talking to us, helped plan a really good day and we were so well taken care of by the team at Creeksea who linked in with our vendors so seamlessly.

We had never seen the venue in summer/sunlight before our wedding day and we were absolutely blown away with how gorgeous Creeksea is. Everything tied together and Carly kept us both so calm and relaxed throughout. Every guest we spoke to commented on how beautiful the venue is and how everything was just perfect, with one person asking “can you do this every week?”. If we could, we would. We cannot thank everyone enough and will remember the day forever.
Thank you again."
V452,Creeksea Place,"We had a twilight wedding at creeksea last month and it was absolutely perfect. We live locally and always knew we wanted to get married at creeksea as it’s such a hidden gem.
We booked only 5 months before the date so it was quite a short lead in time and as a result we had lots of questions! Claire was absolutely fantastic and responded to every query quickly and with a personal touch.
The whole process, from start to finish, was amazing. Nothing was too much trouble. The fact that creeksea isn’t one of these wedding venues that books numerous weddings a week resulting in you become more of a number than an actual wedding was worth its weight in gold. We were made to feel so special.
The day itself was amazing. It truly is the most breathtaking venue. Our guests were blown away with how beautiful it was.
The food truck in the evening was an absolute smash with the guests. The food was out of this world and everyone is still talking about how good it was.
We would recommend creeksea over and over again to anyone looking for the most beautiful and personal wedding, it’s truly spectacular and the service you receive simply cannot be compared.
It was the most magical day and we want to do it all over again."
V452,Creeksea Place,"Creeksea Place Manor House in BoC for us was simply the perfect choice location for our special day. Not only is this gem site local to us, the venue itself is stunning & the staff are professional, helpful & friendly. Although our wedding was small & intimate of which is what we wanted, it was still perfect, details for us included having use of the bridal suite for myself as the bride to get ready alongside my mother & best friend & for my husband he could relax & have a drink/catch up with the family before the ceremony feeling very relaxed. Lastly financially it was fantastic value for money & even if we decided to have the whole day/package for a larger wedding the pricing is still very reasonable."
V452,Creeksea Place,"This is the most gorgeous venue and we are so glad we chose it for our wedding venue. There are so many photo opportunities, and so many different options for ceremony backdrops. Claire, our wedding venue coordinator, was fantastic. She literally answered any question I had at all times of the day. She made our day run smoothly and helped it be the most perfect day. Cannot recommend this venue and the staff enough."
V452,Creeksea Place,"We had our twilight wedding here and the venue is absolutely breathtaking!! Clare and Carly were amazing!! I must’ve messaged Clare 200 times and each time I got a lovely and fast response. No stress approach and I really felt the excitement was shared (that they love what they do). Me and my partner are very much into heavy metal and abit morbid 😅 we incorporated this into our evening and everything was embraced with open minds and arms!. The staff were all wonderful, the food truck was incredible and everyone raved about their food so I cannot recommend them enough also. The lawn games were a massive hit too! Everything was just absolutely perfect and everyone had a fantastic time.

A massive thank you to all of the Creeksea team!"
V452,Creeksea Place,"We recently got married here and couldn't have asked for a better venue. The grounds & house speak for themselves, as soon as we saw it we fell in love, but the staff are the real stars. Nothing was too much hassle, they were so accommodating, responsive & helpful. Carly is fantastic & made sure everything went smoothly on the day. Claire was brilliant too & was great in the build up to the big day. They couldn't have done more for us. Highly recommend Creeksea to anyone and everyone! Thank you for making our day so special."
V452,Creeksea Place,"Had our wedding her on Thursday and despite the outbreak of rain, the team made alternative plans to accommodate us and our guests! Had a wonderful night, thank you to all the team for helping us coordinate our day effectively!!!"
V452,Creeksea Place,"My Husband and l absolutely fell in love with this wedding venue the 1st time we visited there. Its a stunning venue and truly is a hidden gem and brings happy emotions every time I see it. To top off such a stunning venue. I have to send massive compliments to all the staff. They make Creeksea extra special. From the day we put a deposit down to book our special day, until after our wedding day the Management have been the other end of the phone whenever we needed them, day or night. On the day every single staff member was on point they were attentive, friendly and almost felt like family.
Being an older couple in our 40's we booked a twighlight wedding package which was great value for money. This included street food which all our guests and us absolutely loved was so tasty and worth the money. Even the DJ was great that came as part of the package. He was in contact prior to our big day and tailored the music exactly to our preferences. We did spend more on some optional extras, like drink packages, lanterns etc but all still within our budget.
The best wedding venue by far around in my opinion and my guests couldn't believe how great Creeksea was too.
We definitely be re visiting at some point for a stay out of wedding season.
5 star + venue by far."
V452,Creeksea Place,"We instantly knew we were going to book Creeksea when we stepped through the entrance gates. A beautiful Tudor red brick building which felt hidden amongst tall enveloping trees. The perfect setting for our English fairytale wedding! Moving into the orchard we were again blown away by the intimate peaceful nature of this venue with rabbits wondering the grounds and the simple sound of birdsong to keep us company. In the lead up to our day Carly, Claire and the rest of the team couldn’t do enough for us. Responding to questions so quickly and giving us their experienced advice which meant we got the most out of our day. They were also very accommodating with requests such as including a ring warming ceremony (which we decided on three days before the wedding day!) and an outdoor sparkler last dance under their fairy-lit trees, a standout highlight from our day! We were originally drawn to Creeksea for its stunning natural beauty but now see the true gem of this place are the people that work there. We can’t wait to return for future anniversaries and already feel a part of the Creeksea family."
V452,Creeksea Place,"Wow !!!! Everything was absolutely gorgeous the grounds , the bridal cottage, the exquisite Manor House. Every expectation was met by Claire, Michelle And of course John Paul . The planning was spot on and we’ll taken care of . We asked lots and lots and lots of questions and everything was answered. All recommendations from food to fireworks to dj flowers and balloons all were exceptional. The team at Creeksea really do go above and beyond. We could not recommend any higher than we do . They worked within our budget and delivered everything to the T with all our requests. A truly beautiful location and absolutely lovely team , if there was a fairytale godmother for weddings Creeksea is it !!! Love Emma and Grant Wylde"

A big thank you to Kelly, Jack and all the team for making our day so memorable. A fantastic place to have your wedding reception, we wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone."

Once again, thank you for all your help getting family to the coach and yet again collecting us from the lane. Your team were amazing."

Can’t thank you all enough, will definitely see you again soon"
V454,Downham Hall,"We got married at Downham Hall in July 2023 and cannot recommend this venue enough! The location, grounds, rooms and surrounding views are absolutely stunning.

The service was outstanding, the staff worked so hard to make sure everything ran smoothly on the day and were very helpful and informative during the planning process.

The wedding packages they offer are very comprehensive and flexible meaning you can make your wedding day bespoke to you. For example we wanted completely meat free (vegetarian) catering which they were more than happy to create a bespoke menu for us. You also get use of the bridal dressing room and overnight stay in the beautiful hotel rooms included.

I highly recommend you visit the venue to see it for yourself and if you do decide to book it for your wedding day, I’m sure you won’t regret it 💕"
V454,Downham Hall,"We had our wedding here 2 days ago. It’s a beautiful venue, the staff were great, really helpful, nothing was a bother when we asked them for anything. The food was fabulous and the accommodation is lovely. I would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a venue in Essex."

Christina, Debra and all the staff were amazing from start to finish and nothing was too much trouble. I cannot recommend Downham Hall highly enough. We have been back numerous times since. It’s like coming home."
V454,Downham Hall,"After two cancelled dates due to Covid at another venue, my (now) husband and I decided we were tired of waiting and got in touch with the team at Downham Hall just 5 weeks before we were going to tie the knot.

They really couldn’t have done more to accommodate our last-minute request. The team made us feel so so welcome, the venue was stunning, the food incredible and we had the most amazing day.

I really couldn’t recommend Downham Hall more!"
V454,Downham Hall,"Downham Hall proved to be the perfect choice of wedding venue. It's a beautiful country house with stunning grounds and an amazing team, who went above and beyond from start to finish, to make our day perfect. Genuinely can't recommend highly enough.

We were able to choose exactly what food we wanted for our wedding Breakfast and evening meal (even allowing us to provide our own signature cocktail to our guests!) The staff were very attentive throughout the day and the breakfast the morning after with our closest family was amazing! Would highly recommend as a wedding venue. We both still enjoy going back to the venue for meals and afternoon teas now, the views are beautiful and food always amazing!"
V454,Downham Hall,"Oooo I cant believe its been 2 years since our Wedding at Downham hall. The venue was perfect.

There is just so much character in the building and the grounds surrounding Downham hall. Everyone at Downham hall are friendly and helpful, its so lovely that Christina and Andrew are so invested in all their guests. Everything on the day ran perfectly, which I knew it would. The food!

The Hotel, venue, and staff were amazing to us from the planning stage or our wedding, which we were doing from the US, to our actual wedding date. They offered bilingual staff, incredible service and professionalism to both us and our guests. The venue is gorgeous and our wedding pictures really highlighted the beauty of Marygreen Manor.

We suggest all to visit the Marygreen Manor for dinner and /or to stay with them and experience the Manor yourself."

V456,The Manor at Bickley,"The Manor is the perfect venue for weddings! When our wedding venue fell through 4 months before the big day, I stumbled onto the Manor at Bickley and spoke to Craig. He was most helpful and kind and went above and beyond to make sure our wedding went ahead.

We hired the venue for our two day wedding and the staff were helpful and accommodating from start to finish. All of our guests were awed by the beautiful well kept grounds and the excellent service. We can’t thank the staff enough for making our wedding dreams a reality. They thought of every detail from bringing us champagne after our civil ceremony to making sure we had our card box at the end of the night! We are excited to head back to celebrate our anniversary there!"
V456,The Manor at Bickley,"Myself and my Husband chose this venue for our wedding last week and we can’t sing The Manor’s praises enough. From our very first enquiry, to the first viewing of the venue, right though until the big day, the staff at the manor have been nothing short of brilliant! Each staff member we came across was polite and accommodating. Special mention to Craig and Vicky with whom we did most of our liaising throughout the months leading up until our wedding. Craig and Vicky were super helpful, responsive and went above and beyond to make sure that we could have the day of our dreams. Even with last minute changes due to the weather, Craig who was just incredible throughout, managed to help us sort a backup plan so our day would still go ahead seamlessly.

The rooms at the manor were spacious and modern, giving us and our wedding party lots of space for photographers and videographers to capture the special moments on our wedding morning.

The lodge that was used for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready was fabulous. The manor was very flexible in giving us early access so we could get ready on time.

The grand marquee was definitely grand! Very spacious and when decorated looked like something out of a fairytale! lots of kitchen space, a huge bar and fantastic overhead speakers for the party!

The manor was super flexible to our needs regarding access, start times, outsourcing our vendors and much more. The venue is beautiful and spacious with options for outdoor and indoor events and entertainment. The grounds were absolutely beautiful, so many lovely spots for photos not only for us as the bride and groom but for guests too!

A very special thank you to our point of contact throughout, Craig. From our first meeting, he was charming, bubbly and made us feel super welcome. He reassured us that he has experience in African/Caribbean weddings and that our wedding day would amazing and it was. He was attentive and always let us know that he was only a phone call or e-mail away and was always quick to respond and answer any questions we had.

All in all, we had the most beautiful day at The manor and we would definitely recommend this venue for a wedding or other events.

V457,Citation Weddings & Events.,"We could not have picked a more perfect venue for our wedding reception. We were obsessed with the building and decor as we wanted a contemporary, city centre wedding and Citation ticked all the boxes! Pauline was so helpful on the run up to the day by staying in contact regularly and helping us to prepare fully for our wedding. A highlight of ours was our menu tasting - it was like a private dining experience and the food was unreal!

The food was amazing, from the canapés to the wedding breakfast, and everyone commented on how much they loved it!
We were quite literally waited on the entire day and the staff in particular (especially Aidan, Darren and Robert) made us feel so special and important. The layout was great as well to allow people space to sit and chat, but also plenty of room at the dance floor - especially for our Ceilidh which went down an absolute treat!

Thanks to Citation, we had the perfect wedding day from start to finish. You helped create memories for us which will last a lifetime and every time we walk past, we will be reminded of how we celebrated the most important day of our lives in one of Glasgow’s most iconic and memorable venues."
V457,Citation Weddings & Events.,"Our wedding at Citation was perfect, we couldn’t have asked for a more relaxed day! Hannah, Aidan and Casey and the rest of the staff on the day did such a fantastic job in making sure everything ran smoothly, if anything went wrong then we had no idea!
We had so many comments from guests about how lovely the venue was, the delicious meal and how efficient everything ran. Pauline and Hannah put our minds at ease from the very first meeting, the planning stage was not really stressful at all for us as they had everything covered and made sure no small detail was forgotten, even thinking of things that would never have crossed our minds.
Thanks again to everyone at Citation, we can’t recommend them highly enough!"
V457,Citation Weddings & Events.,"Had an amazing time having our wedding at Citation. The staff were very lovely and throughout the process were great at answering our questions. We wanted to lose some of the traditional wedding elements and add in a few bits of our own, which the venue accommodated brilliantly, even though some venues won’t.

The food was great and all dietary requirements were easily catered for

Our guests even commented on how friendly, helpful and pleasant the staff were so it was great that they noticed it too and not just us as the people staff were working most directly with. They definitely went above and beyond and we are super grateful!"

Louize and the team are an absolute credit to Citation, Louize in particular is amazing, so accommodating, friendly and most importantly so knowledgeable and competent she really takes the pressure off and allows the couple to enjoy the planning of their day as well as the day itself. Citation is absolutely breath-taking, such a beautiful venue in the middle of Glasgow I cannot think of a single other place that could compare. The entire day of my wedding I had guests talking about how beautiful the venue was and how wonderful the staff were. The master of ceremonies was a gentleman and instantly put an anxious bride at ease! I can never thank you all enough, you absolutely gave me the day I have always dreamt of and with a team that made us feel first class all day"

V462,Barony Castle Hotel,"When looking for wedding venues with forestry, sadly Scotland is lacking. Thankfully we have Barony Castle Hotel. The woodland alter was absolutely stunning and sold us right away. Our day had over 100 guests and Barony handled this with grace and ease. We had a lot of requests and the staff were happy to oblige or help us to achieve our dream day. Hannah the wedding coordinator was incredible at managing the bookings and details of our day, we couldn’t have done it without her. Another I’d like to mention is Sarah, she was really brilliant on the day and helped where Hannah was elsewhere. Even our guests commented on how great the hotel we’re at handling our big family.
Our day was so so special and very unique compared to so many other weddings I see online. I cannot thank or recommend Barony and their staff enough.
Some advice to future couples:
Firstly, for peak autumn, go for the second last Saturday in October. The leaves are gorgeous if storms hold off.
Make sure you get a photographer with a drone as their map of Scotland is stunning, some friends thought our photos were AI the grounds looked so good. And lastly, enjoy your day! Barony know what they’re doing"
V462,Barony Castle Hotel,"We had the most incredible wedding weekend at Barony Castle, nothing was too much trouble, Hannah the wedding coordinator was beyond helpful and gave us great advice and guidance on the lead up to our day.
The setting was absolutely beautiful, we were really happy with the food and the staff were fantastic.
We had the use of 2 of the suites and can not fault either, they both made a gorgeous backdrop for our getting ready pictures.
We thought the barony offered excellent value for money with their wedding package and they were so flexible with lots of our different requests helping make it a stress free and fun lead up to our wedding.
I would highly recommend this venue"
V462,Barony Castle Hotel,"We chose the Barony because of the beautiful location, the friendly staff we met on that first day when reviewing possible wedding venues, the stunning grounds, the amazing wedding room along with the main function room. It provided us with the perfect Scottish wedding, that myself and my Portuguese wife were so keen to share with all our friends and family. Having such a well organised dedicated wedding planner like Hannah, took so much stress away from us. The wedding day went without a hitch, and we’ll remember it forever. Thank you Hannah, the Chef, and all the staff at The Barony. You all helped to make this our perfect Wedding day"
V462,Barony Castle Hotel,The staff were really perfect to us from planning to execution. Perfection!
V462,Barony Castle Hotel,"From initial booking to even the days after Barony Castle were absolutely brilliant, the packages they offer take all of the stress our of wedding planning with their excellent experienced suppliers just getting in touch with you directly.

Rooms were lovely, facilities at the hotel were great and the wedding coordinator there is exceptional, nothing is too big or too small and they are well practised with weddings, can't reccomend booking with them enough."
V462,Barony Castle Hotel,"We couldn’t be happier with our decision to have our wedding at Barony Castle Hotel! The venue itself is nothing short of stunning - an idyllic setting, perfect for our autumn wedding - and the exceptional service we received made our special day truly unforgettable.

Hannah played an integral role, guiding us through the entire planning process with meticulous attention to detail. On the day, her expertise ensured everything ran seamlessly, and her support was invaluable. When James took over in the evening, the transition was flawless, and we knew we were in the best hands. The entire team’s professionalism and dedication allowed us to relax and fully immerse ourselves in every moment of our special day.

The culinary experience was equally exceptional. The chef crafted three delicious menus, including an evening buffet for the guests who arrived the night before the wedding. He also took the time to personally meet with us during the tasting to discuss our dietary needs. Each dish was outstanding!

From Hannah's planning expertise to Janette’s attentive care at reception, every detail was handled beautifully. We wholeheartedly recommend Barony Castle Hotel to any couple seeking a breathtaking venue with the friendliest, first-class service.

Our heartfelt thanks to the entire team for making our wedding day so magical!

V462,Barony Castle Hotel,We had our amazing wedding day here. I can highly recommend having your wedding day here. Staff were amazing and very accommodating and helpful they went above and beyond for us. The grounds are simply stunning and very picturesque. The food was also amazing and very good portion sizes none left hungry that's for sure. If I could I would do it all again here.
V462,Barony Castle Hotel,We chose barony castle as we had our first date there and got engaged there. So it made sense to also get married in such a beautiful venue.

V462,Barony Castle Hotel,"The venue is beautiful, and for those who have never been, the first view of the hotel when you drive up is stunning.

In the run up to the wedding Hannah and her team were amazing at making sure every little detail was listened to. No question was too silly!


The hotel is beautiful and all our guests commented on this.

On the weekend of the wedding we couldn’t have asked for better service. The duty manager Sara was incredible and so focused on making sure we had the most amazing time.

We would recommend Barony for anyone looking for their perfect wedding venue"

V464,Western House Hotel,From start to finish Laura and the team and western house were unbelievable. Our day was so much better than we could have even hoped for. The hotel itself and the grounds are stunning and look amazing in the pics too. Every single guest commented on the venue and the team too.
V464,Western House Hotel,"My husband and I got married at western house hotel last month and were blown away with how beautiful it was and how incredibly helpful the staff all were. Laura our wedding coordinator was always at the other end of an email or phone call with all our questions and nothing was a bother to her or the amazing staff. They were all brilliant and cannot express how grateful we are to them all. The venue itself is stunning and we instantly fell in love with it after viewing a few places, we requested that the fire be lite for our ceremony which wasn’t a hassle and Laura kept me and my bridal party right. We would highly highly recommend western house hotel. They made our wedding day even more magical."
V464,Western House Hotel,We had the most perfect day. All of the staff went above and beyond for us. Our guests still talk about how amazing the food was. We could not fault a single thing. Special mention to Laura and our master of ceremonies (sorry I didn’t catch your name on the day) who made sure everything ran smoothly.
V464,Western House Hotel,"Just wanted to say a huge thank you to everyone who made our wedding day so special on 26th October. From start to finish the day was just perfect and everything went better than i expected. We arrived at the hotel the day before and from the minute we arrived we were made to feel so important. Every part of our day was looked into and we were kept up to date with everything on the day as well. The way Laura was with my Gramps was just fantastic, he doesn't keep well and she constantly checked everything was ok for him the full time. We loved this hotel for years and so glad we bit the bullet and decided to get married here. It was fantastic. Can't wait for another wee visit in the New Year."
V464,Western House Hotel,"Western House Hotel. WOW...what a TEAM.

We honestly can not thank you enough for the amazing service from beginning to end!! The most special Wedding we could have asked for. You made me feel like a Princess.

Western House Hotel you should be so proud to have such dedicated, professional, caring & immaculate staff. Shamefully we can not remember everyone's names, but here's a few of the many that made such an impact:

Jean - for dealing with me through the worst of my OCD.
Nathan - so charming, organised & nothing but a gentleman.
Laura - is just perfect. Just what every Wedding/Bride needs.
James at the Bar - for keeping the drinks flowing & ensuring all guests were happy.
James 'the butler' - for your tremendous efforts, you never stopped.
Colin - nothing was a hassle & you sure brought a smile to my face.

Bar Staff, Reception, Gardeners, Night Staff, Chefs/Cooks, Table Staff, Housemaids you made our day truly special.

A day not to be forgotten.

An Honest & Sincere ... Thank You!"
V464,Western House Hotel,"I got married at the hotel on Thursday 20th December 2012 and would like to thank all the staff for a truly perfect wedding day.

The staff were amazing, the hotel itself was beautiful as was the food. Although the weather was awful it didn't matter as the roaring log fires and stunning decorations meant that we got fantastic pictures inside.

I'd like to thank Jean for being so helpful throughout the planning stages and also to Laura who was incredible at looking after us, the day before and the day of the wedding. Every staff member was excellent and a credit to the hotel."
V464,Western House Hotel,"Had the most AMAZING wedding at Western House Hotel on 28th December 2012. Everything was perfect! The staff could not have been more helpful, the setting was SO cozy and lovely and most importantly, all of our guests had a brilliant time. We have had had lots of lovely comments from our guests about the venue and the staff asking us to pass on their thoughts about the quality of service throughout the day. So many wedding venues have become a little bit 'too big for their boots' and have lost the personal touch, but not the Western House Hotel, on the day, they will make you feel like your wedding is the only one they have all year! Love and best wishes for all of your 2013 Brides and Grooms."
V465,Ardoe House Hotel and Spa,"Ardoe proved to be the perfect venue and location for our wedding. We got lucky with the weather as it turned out to be the sunniest day of the year, but everything else went so well due to the professionalism and patience of the staff. Ours was a Scottish/Nigerian event, and they accommodated all the different cultural requests concerning our food and entertainment. This understanding, the Sunday discount, and the high standard of service throughout made it an epic day. Thank you Ardoe!"
V465,Ardoe House Hotel and Spa,I just wanted to leave a quick review to say a huge thank you to everyone at Ardoe for making our day magical. The planning process with our wedding co-ordiantors was faultless and on the day it went all according to plan! I would highly recommend Ardoe house for a wedding venue to anyone looking to get married
V465,Ardoe House Hotel and Spa,"I just want to a say a very BIG thank you to Nicki and the team for the outstanding service we have received!

A major shout out to the extremely professional duty manager ( Andre) and his assistant whom provided a completely faultless service through out the night! Our experience was more than we could have hoped for and made our day very memorable and special.

With out a doubt we will be back to visit next time we are up in the area."
V465,Ardoe House Hotel and Spa,"I was sat looking at wedding venues nearly a year and a half ago before coming across Ardoe House, Not for a second did i think we would be able to afford to have our wedding here. I met with the wedding team and discussed our details. They had a fantastic wedding offer that fitted our budget and had everything included that we wanted! I am so glad i contacted the hotel. We had the best day ever. Cannot wait to come back for our complimentary anniversary stay"
V465,Ardoe House Hotel and Spa,"We had a fantastic weekend. All our guests commented on how amazing the hotel was, the food and most importantly the staff.
We had the most gorgeous wedding and I wouldn’t change one part of it.
Thank you again for all of your help Nicki & the team"
V465,Ardoe House Hotel and Spa,"We had an amazing day from start to finish. All staff at Ardoe were amazing, so professional, polite, friendly, welcoming, helpful- they couldn't have done more to help! Thank you!"
V465,Ardoe House Hotel and Spa,"The whole day of our wedding was so perfect. Thank you so much for everything you did. Nicki and all of the staff were amazing and we are both so grateful.
The food was incredible and we had a lot of comments from guests about how good it was and how much they enjoyed it.
I really felt like on the day we didn't need to worry about anything because you had everything taken care of.
Thank you"
V465,Ardoe House Hotel and Spa,"Ardoe house we cannot thank you enough for all that you did for us. We had the best day of our lives as you promised to us from the very start. We picked the Blair's package which came with all the extra benefits of a champagne reception, Canapes and chair covers. We hired the beautiful hotel candelabras from the hotel at a fantastic price. The hotel literally took care of everything. We were only left to worry about my dress, cake and Band! Thank you all so much for the most perfect day!"
V465,Ardoe House Hotel and Spa,"We got married here last Friday and I honestly cannot thank the staff at Ardoe enough for what was the most perfect day! I cannot think of one negative thing to say. It was a dream from start to finish.
The food that was served at our wedding was delicious, piping hot and well presented. All my guests commented on what a lovely meal it was and all dietary requirements were catered for. I requested, pies, chips and cheese for my evening buffet and it did not disappoint either. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the members of staff and they made our day go so smoothly, when asked anything the response was always ""not a problem""

I cannot recommend this hotel enough for a wedding and for a wee break, we stayed here a few times before we got married and I am already asking my new husband when we are going back as after Friday, Ardoe house really is a special place for us!

We dealt with a few wedding coordinators along the way but it was the new wedding coordinator Nicki who saw us through to the end and how amazing was she?! She replied to our emails promptly and answered our millions of questions in the lead up to the big day. Like all the staff nothing was a bother for her and she is a great asset to a wonderful team!"
V465,Ardoe House Hotel and Spa,"We had our wedding at Ardoe House in March this year and it was everything we had hoped for.
The staff were amazing throughout from the the organisation prior and then the day went without a glitch. I would definitely recommend this hotel for the perfect wedding venue"
V466,The Citizen,N/A
V467,Kippilaw House,"Just wanted to send a quick message to say thanks for everything , we had an amazing day :)"
V467,Kippilaw House,"I just wanted to say a huge thank you for letting us have beautiful Kippilaw House for Lucy & Christopher’s wedding. The whole weekend has been amazing and everyone was totally wowed by the fabulous venue.

Special thank you to the awesome Rachel who has been simply wonderful all the way through the planning right up to being our rock through the big day. What a star you are 🌟🌟

Thanks also to all the staff both front and back of house, the meal was delicious, and the bar staff were brilliant 🤩

An Amazing memory making weekend, with love and grateful thanks"
V467,Kippilaw House,"We looked at venues for our wedding all cross the country but nowhere suited us better than Kippilaw. A beautiful old manor house in the Scottish countryside not only for our wedding venue but also a special week for our families to stay in.
All of the staff were extremely friendly and hospitable on our wedding day as well as leading up to it. They went above and beyond, even getting our favorite beverage that they didn’t stock in for our toast!
We can’t thank them enough for making our day so perfect.

-Oscar & Vicky"
V467,Kippilaw House,"Our recent wedding at Kippilaw House in Scotland was an absolute delight that surpassed all expectations. The whole house and ground were not only beautiful but also breathtaking whilst providing an unparalleled level of comfort, ensuring our stay was nothing short of exceptional. Kippilaw is a truly stunning place, from the gorgeous veranda that leads out to jaw dropping garden where we had our drinks reception, to the beautiful old Copper beech tree next to the house that we had our ceremony underneath.

The people who own the place and the staff are remarkably hospitable, which added a personal and welcoming touch, making our entire experience truly memorable. Rachel, the manager at Kippilaw, helped us plan our special day was beyond accommodating, catering to every odd request or question we had to truly create the dream wedding we pictured and even in the end helping us save money!
The food served was absolutely unbelievable as well, far beyond any other meals we have had at other weddings we’ve attended, it reminded us of being in a top class restaurant. Kippilaw House stands out not just as a venue but as an extraordinary destination for those seeking an unforgettable celebration. We highly recommend it for anyone desiring a perfect blend of elegance, comfort, and culinary excellence. Five stars hardly capture the sheer brilliance of our experience at Kippilaw House."
V467,Kippilaw House,"We had a fabulous day at a Wedding at Kippilaw House. The house and gardens are stunning, the service fantastic and the food was excellent. The attention to detail shone through, all in all a very unique venue."
V467,Kippilaw House,Me and my husband couldn't be more thrilled with how our wedding turned out at kippilaw! We got married last year and we still reminisce about how perfect our whole weekend was. Everything from the ceremony to the house to the food was exactly as we imagined our dream scottish wedding would be. We can't thank Lil and the team enough for their amazing hospitality and attention to detail!!
V467,Kippilaw House,"We went to the most wonderful wedding here on the 7th October 2023 and it made me wish we could get married again and come here. The quality of food and the level of attention the owners and staff gave everyone was outstanding. I cannot eat gluten and they had catered for me on every course and even on canapés so I didn’t miss out- a great place, I couldn’t rate it higher"
V467,Kippilaw House,"Had our wedding here and it was absolutely fantastic. Lil and Rachel worked with us to plan an amazing experience. Thanks to the hot weather, we were able to get married outside and it was beautiful. My partner and I didn't have to worry about a thing on the day, absolutely everything was handled for us. Food was delicious with delicious options for all dietary requirements. We actually had a full vegetarian menu and it was delicious. So many options to pick from as opposed to just adding veggie options as an afterthought. The sharing pavlova also went down a treat with everyone (including those who had to have dairy free options!). We had lots of freedom and flexibility to decorate and design our day too Thanks again to all!"
V467,Kippilaw House,"We couldn't have imagined a better venue than Kippilaw for our wedding in June. Perhaps more importantly than the beautiful setting, Lil was fantastically flexible and accommodating in enabling us to have the weekend that we wanted and the day that we dreamed of, whilst providing plenty of useful advice throughout the planning process."
V467,Kippilaw House,"We got married at Kippilaw House and had the best time ever. Rachel was the best, she was super helpful the whole time and made us feel very comfortable. We didn’t feel any pressure to do anything we didn’t want to as we skipped a lot of traditional things that didn’t match with who we are.
They were amazing at changing the menu for some of the guest with allergies. The food was lovely and everybody enjoyed it. It was really nice to stay overnight with our friends and family, it made our wedding really special.

If you want a special place for your wedding ceremony we HIGHLY recommend the ancient tree. It was magical."
V468,Marshall Meadows Manor House,"We recently got married at the hotel and it was beyond our expectations. There was moments during the organisation that we felt a little nervous our day would not go ahead with covid and also with the hotel changing hands. However, all of our concerns were soon put aside and we could not have been happier with our special day. Some of our guests arrived on the Friday evening and we were welcomed by very friendly and professional staff. We had dinner in a private dinning area which was lovely. On the big day we had exclusivity of the hotel for the rest of our guests to join. The bridal party got ready in the bridal suite which is beautiful and very spacious. The day went as planned with the hotel staff, especially Joanna and James, were excellent and kept everything in order on the day. Anything we asked was not a problem for them. The food was first class and the wedding room was stunning. We could not recommended this hotel enough. It really was the best day of our lives and we could not have done it without the help of all the staff at the hotel. The newly refurbished bedrooms and public areas are amazing and could not be faulted. All of our guests had the best time.


The Hotel is absolutely beautiful after refurb. Staff couldn't do enoight for us to make our"
V468,Marshall Meadows Manor House,"From our initial meeting at the venue to waving goodbye the day after our wedding I cannot fault Marshal Meadows Manor. The quality of food, choice, service and the venue for the price we paid was amazing. When we were looking for venues nowhere came close price wise. It’s a beautiful venue with a separate purpose built building for the ceremony with a sea view. The bridal suite is absolutely stunning. Our guests said that the wedding meal was the best they had had at a wedding and they loved the fact they got to choose their own courses (from 3 options per course). And lastly the kindness and professionalism of the staff can’t be beaten. We felt like it was a home from home. They were so warm and welcoming and helpful. I can’t recommend this venue more highly."
V468,Marshall Meadows Manor House,"Our wedding at Marshall Meadows Manor House was everything we could have wished for. The venue was absolutely beautiful, we were blessed with amazing weather and the staff were so friendly and helpful throughout the whole day! We were also so impressed with the food and several guests commented on how delicious everything was.

Our guests were also super impressed with the rooms at Marshall Meadows, the bridal suite really is so impressive and perfect for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready together.

We even got to venture down to the nearby cliffs after the ceremony to get some amazing photos along the coastline of the border.

Couldn't recommend Marshall Meadows enough! Thank you so much for making our wedding so perfect."
V468,Marshall Meadows Manor House,"This venue is an absolute gem, located with beautiful surroundings, right on the border and the coast with beautiful views. The building, inside and out is perfectly matched to its star rating and is all we wanted for our wedding. The staff are all willing to help with anything, and did everything they possibly could to ensure our big day went perfectly. If we had any queries, they were on hand to help.
All of our guests, and ourselves were extremely pleased with the way the day went, and loved every minute of it.
There is no way Marshall Meadows, or any of its staff can be faulted in any way. They take any stress and worry out of the organisation and take everything in hand to allow you to enjoy the day.
We love the place so much we will be going back, and our guests are looking forward to going back one day again.
And for the mojito and whiskey lovers out there - definitely a yes!!!!!"
V468,Marshall Meadows Manor House,"We knew after our first visit that Marshall Meadows was the venue for us.
The elegant style of the building and modern yet classic decor really stood out.
After dining here we couldn’t wait for the big day!
Picking the wedding breakfast was difficult as every dish we tried we loved.
The pizza van in the evening gave an amazing relaxed vibe and really complimented our chilled approach.
Michelle and Toyah were both fantastic and a credit to this venue.
Our day ran so smoothly and I thank them and all the staff for this.
We had the pleasure of staying for three nights, the stable suite, the bridal suite and the pods are amazing, the attention to detail is flawless.

I highly recommend this beautiful Manor House , working in the wedding industry I visit many venues in Scotland and we choose to hop the border to spend our special day here."
V469,Branxholm Park,"I was just married here in June and I cannot say enough good things about this venue or the people who truly make it shine. Over your stay here no matter how short you will immediately feel like you are a part of the family. David and Deb are so wonderfully kind, incredibly helpful, personable, and outstanding at what they do. We planned this wedding from across the pond and I didn't have to worry once about food (which was one of the best meals I had while abroad), any of the ceremony or reception sites or flowers, really they take care of so much for you it makes the day so smooth and easy! My wedding day was an absolute dream and fulfilled every LOTR elvish whim I could imagine. Again I cannot say enough good things about David and the staff at Branxholm no one went hungry and certainly not thirsty the whole weekend. All of this and the fact that there are horses, baby chicks, goats, incredible accommodations, and literally SO MUCH more makes Branxholm Park the PERFECT wedding venue. I booked site unseen, it even rained and I regret nothing."
V469,Branxholm Park,"Fantastic time at Darren & Eilidh Leslie wedding *, beautiful venue,lovely food and great staff*. Thanks for letting oscar feed the horses"
V469,Branxholm Park,"Brothers wedding so my son and I stayed the weekend along with other family members. Cannot recommend this place enough. Food was brilliant, the rooms were brilliant. Staff were so friendly, one of them even let my wee boy feed the horses on the Saturday morning. He absolutely loved it. If you are looking for a place for a wedding then this is the place"
V469,Branxholm Park,"We got married at Branxholm Park in September 2024. The venue is beautiful; a quirky, well-curated collection of indoor and outdoor spaces, ensuring nobody could ever get bored. The animals are a gorgeous inclusion - the goats and horses are so friendly, and there's a wonderfully affectionate 3-legged cat called Cookie who was the real star of our day!

We booked the venue unseen - just based on the website and video tours - as we live in South Wales so couldn't nip up to an open day. This definitely contributed to my anxiety leading up to the day, but David & Debbie assured us that lots of people book without visiting, and the house and grounds really did exceed expectations. We did gasp as we drove up the road and saw it for the first time. We were lucky to have gorgeous sunny weather and the most amazing group of guests and vendors, so despite anxieties and small oversights, it really was a perfect wedding.

The staff at the house were fantastic, making us feel so incredibly welcome from the moment we arrived. Nothing was too much trouble. A special mention to Becky and Tracey, who were just fabulous friendly faces and above-and-beyond helpful.

I would have to say, though, that the wedding would have been much easier if we'd been able to speak to Becky (the on-the-day coordinator) in advance. It would also have been nice to receive some sort of welcome pack or guide to wedding planning. All the planning is done through emails with Debbie (the owner) who was a little difficult to talk to - slow or non-existent replies, confusing typos, lack of detail, and would not provide things like a seating plan despite being asked repeatedly. Maybe she's just very relaxed because they have a template for wedding days, but as an anxious couple we could have done with better communication and some more support with finalising details of our day. Several things that Debbie agreed/assured us would happen were not communicated to Becky and the house staff - they immediately sorted things out after our arrival and a quick chat, but it was unfair that they weren't warned about updates!

It's a shame that the organisation prior to the wedding was frustrating, as Branxholm Park truly has the potential to be the greatest 5-star wedding venue. After our arrival, everything felt very fun and relaxed, and the 2-night package allowed us to settle in and explore without feeling rushed about. We made use of the hot tub and karaoke room the first night, slept well in the huge comfortable beds, and had a relaxed morning getting ready in the house without having to stress about travelling to a separate ceremony venue. The whole house-party vibe was perfect for a relaxed holiday experience without feeling stuffy or formal. Some areas could have done with a better clean and a bit of love, and one of the showers upstairs didn't seem to work, but this didn't spoil it for us.

The meal the night before the wedding was lovely; hearty burgers with chips and an incredible range of cakes. The vegan cakes were among the best we've ever tasted - the blueberry/banana and the jaffa cake were standouts! Our wedding cake was a vegan lemon and blueberry one, which tasted absolutely amazing but was a little disappointing visually - it didn't resemble the reference images we had sent, and had been covered in artificial flowers, which was honestly a little tacky.* The promised ""cake sword"" also did not appear - we were just handed a kitchen knife for our cake cutting photos - and we weren't warned that there was cardboard inside each tier (not between; inside) of the cake, which made it difficult to cut.

Breakfast and brunch were excellent, no shortage of bacon/sausage/egg/vegan rolls, jam-filled croissants, and other lovely snacks. The canapes were also lovely - a great selection including some fab Asian-fusion style bites which is apparently the chef's speciality - I wish we'd known this in advance, as it might have influenced our dinner choices. The meal on the wedding day was a little disappointing, especially the risotto, but we did take a chance by going off-menu, which was very kind of the team to accommodate. A guest particularly remarked on the high quality of the gluten-free bread rolls, and all allergies/dietary requirements were catered for. Guests were promised gluten-free gnocchi but were given pasta instead, which was still very tasty but just a bit of a shame.

*On that note - be aware that all of the florals provided as part of the venue package are artificial and re-used repeatedly. This was not an issue for us, and better than importing real flowers and the associated waste, but just worth mentioning as this isn't explicitly stated by the venue.

Our guests stayed in the flats in Hawick that are also owned by David - these had a couple of issues with cleanliness/storage space and confusing plumbing but on the whole were lovely and comfortable. One major flaw was that there is only one set of keys per flat - this is fine for the one-bed, but made it frustrating for the people in the five-bed as they were all arriving at different times.

The only other real snag was accessibility - we had a guest who uses a wheelchair, and were told that the chapel was accessible but it is actually up a steep gravel slope (not clear on the video tour) and does not have space for a wheelchair, meaning he had to sit outside for the ceremony. The only downstairs loo is also not big enough for disabled access, and the house and glasshouse both have a step at the entrance. We understand that it's an old house and as such wouldn't have been built with accessibility in mind, but just be aware!

Overall, if you love animals and are looking for a whimsical wedding getaway with endless entertainment and photo opportunities, Branxholm Park is the place for you! The package deal they offer is ideally suited to laid-back, go-with-the-flow couples who don't need fine control of every aspect of their day and are relaxed about the planning process and timeline."
V469,Branxholm Park,"We had the most magical wedding at Branxholm. The team at the venue made sure everything ran smoothly and went above and beyond on every aspect of the day. Arthur the puppy especially loved his special treatment. Our guests had a great day and said it was the best wedding they had ever attended.

It is a truly unique venue and would highly recommend it to everyone."
V469,Branxholm Park,"Our wedding at Branxholm Park in Hawick was nothing short of spectacular, thanks to the incredible team and the stunning venue itself. From the moment we arrived, we were treated to an experience that exceeded all our expectations, making our special day truly unforgettable.

Deb and David, our wedding coordinators, were phenomenal. Their expertise, attention to detail, and genuine care for our wedding were evident from our first meeting. They were instrumental in ensuring everything ran smoothly, allowing us to fully enjoy our day without any worries. Deb's thoughtful gesture of getting us food to feed the goats for our pictures was a delightful and memorable highlight, adding a unique touch to our celebration.

Jess, Tracy and the rest of the staff provided service that was nothing short of amazing. Jess, in particular, was always available to answer any questions and assist us throughout our three-day stay. Her warm and accommodating nature made us feel at ease, and she went above and beyond to ensure every aspect of our event was perfect.

The night before the wedding was incredibly relaxed, setting the tone for the rest of our stay. We all enjoyed exploring the beautiful grounds, taking a dip in the hot tub, using the karaoke room, and playing volleyball and football tennis. The relaxed atmosphere allowed us to unwind and enjoy quality time with our loved ones, making the lead-up to our big day even more special.

All our guests were captivated by the beauty of Branxholm Park. The venue's charm and elegance created the perfect backdrop for our wedding, and many guests commented on how stunning it was. The picturesque surroundings, coupled with the well-maintained and beautifully decorated spaces, made for an enchanting setting that will forever be etched in our memories.

The canapés served at our wedding were a standout feature, with numerous guests raving about their quality and taste. Each bite was a culinary delight, reflecting the high standards of Branxholm Park's catering. The attention to detail in the presentation and the exquisite flavours truly impressed everyone, adding to the overall excellence of our wedding experience. I know that the Bestman tried his best to eat as many unlimited canapés as he could and at one point have 5 finished risotto spoons in his hand.

One of the most memorable aspects of our wedding was the opportunity to interact with the goats during our photo session, thanks to Deb who brought out goat food to attract them over. This unique and personal touch made our day even more special and provided us with cherished memories and wonderful photos.

Branxholm Park is an exceptional wedding venue that combines breathtaking beauty with outstanding service. All of the staff played crucial roles in making our wedding day perfect, and we are incredibly grateful for their dedication and hard work. We highly recommend Branxholm Park to anyone seeking a magical and unforgettable wedding experience. The intimate venue was beautiful, had a very relaxed vibe, and served great food and extremely tasty cakes! Thank you to all at Branxholm Park for making our dream wedding a reality."
V469,Branxholm Park,"Two weeks ago we got married at this stunning venue! 😍
From start to finish they couldn't do enough for us.
All of our guests described the day as
‘Magical’ 🥹 and honestly it really did feel like that!
David, thank you from the Friday we arrived you were very good with us all and made sure we had everything and nothing was a problem to them!
Your staff are so lovely too, especially the lady who was doing the room cleans. Sorry i have forgot her name but she was so good with the children too.

I would 100% recommend getting a reception drinks singer and a dj for the evening!

Overall from start to finish the price / package was just perfect so thank you so so much xxi"
V469,Branxholm Park,"Just arrived home after our wedding here at Branxholm Park. The venue was absolutely perfect, everything had been thought of. Everywhere you looked you’d find a stunning little area that made the place feel so whimsical. David & Debs are fantastic hosts, nothing was a problem and they were at hand not only on the lead up to the wedding but also throughout our stay to make sure everything went to plan. The wedding package is great and made everything feel so stress free. The staff were brilliant, so helpful and just fit into the day to make sure everything ticked along nicely. Hats off to the chef, the food was out of this world!!

We can’t recommend this place enough, a magical wedding venue!

Thank you again for everything!"
V469,Branxholm Park,"My husband and I got married here just days ago.

We came a long way from London, and took a gamble having never seen the venue in person before. Let me tell you; as our minibus ambled round the corner and Branxholm Park came into view, we all gasped. It’s just stunning. Truly something out of a fairytale.

We were given the warmest of welcomes by the wonderful Tracey, who had also helped our other guests to their rooms. Actually, she was, along with too many other points to mention, a highlight of our wedding experience. Tracey couldn’t do too much for us; she was such an Angel. She looked after our party so well that she was a fond topic of conversation on the way home! We love you Tracey!

I then caught up with David, who ran through every aspect of the following day with me, ensuring that everything we wanted and needed was in place. Again, I need to shout out to him because he checked on me consistently throughout the day, and was a huge hit with the kids; taking them with him armed with carrots to see the horses, and generally being fantastic. If you’re nervous or full of emotions then you need someone steady and calm like David to see you through!

The chapel was adorned with florals of our colour choice, and was something out of a true fairytale. With twinkling fairy lights and gorgeous details!

Each of our rooms were designed with a different theme in mind and were so luxurious and stunning that we didn’t want to leave. No, really!

The grounds are huge, and there is so much to do; our groomsmen spent the wedding morning using the spa facilities whilst the kids fell in love with the goats and outdoor playground.

The head chef, Jamie, was a hilarious sweetheart who as a fellow south Londoner I loved bantering with! The food was sublime.

I think I could spend all day writing about all the wonderful things that made our day so special. But alas, word limits. If you’re thinking about getting married here. Just do it. These memories will last us a lifetime; our guests, too. Best wedding I’ve ever been to and it was my own!

To David, Deb, Tracey, Jamie and ALL the wonderful staff (Jess, for holding my veil!!) we’d like to thank you from the bottom of our hearts for playing such a massive role in making our day the best ever. ♥️♥️"
V469,Branxholm Park,"When selecting a wedding venue, after doing our research we decided to visit Branxholm Park as it ticked all our boxes - it catered for a more intimate size of wedding, it was exclusive use, and it had on site accommodation. We thought it looked beautiful on the website - as Michael put ""a bit like where the elves in Lord of the Rings"" would dine"".

When we visited, we knew very quickly that this was our perfect place, so much so that we never viewed any other venues! We could instantly envision ourselves an our guests celebrating here on our wedding weekend, staying in the beautiful rooms and chilling in the sauna. Michael's only question was - will there be dessert? However after sampling some of the delicious cakes that Deb made, we were more than satisfied that this was a yes.

When we arrived at the venue on the eve of our wedding, David was there to put our wedding nerves at ease. We were free to explore the venue, and to share all the rooms, features and animals with our families and friends. Our niece and nephew loved the mini cinema on the top floor, and were endlessly amused for the whole weekend. The Bring Your Own Booze option worked very well, with the groom party enjoying a few drinks then night before (until 3am!).

On the wedding day itself, myself and the bridal party opted for the oriental room to get ready in, though there were plenty of other options. Tracy looked after us, bringing coffees, breakfast, lunch and some fizz while we were getting ready.

The venue has a beautiful mini chapel which we got married in. As it was a gorgeous sunny day, our guests were able to make full use of the lovely grounds to enjoy a drink before and after the ceremony. Our photographers were delighted with so many options for stunning backdrops.

The wedding meal was fantastic. We enjoyed the (competitive) champagne fountain, and the dining room itself was beautiful. We added our own finishing touches to each table - favours and ""wedding trump"" cards - however they were already beautiful with nothing more needed.

One thing I would say is that you and your guests will never go hungry. The catering team did an amazing job on the meal itself, and kept us fed throughout the night with rolls, chips (according to several of our guests - the best chips they had ever eaten) and cake. They also catered to various allergies, intolerances and tastes.

The disco room worked very well. Our music connected easily to the speaker system, and we danced the night away. Our guests enjoyed playing barperson, and the drinks were flowing.
What I enjoyed most about the after party is that there was something for everyone - it was lovely to see our dad's playing a game of table tennis, and our friends singing karaoke with silly hats on. This is the perfect set up for extraverts and introverts alike!

Overall, I would recommend Branxholm Park if you are seeking a more intimate wedding with your closest family and friends. They managed to capture a house party vibe while adding a taste of luxury and a touch of magic. We could not have asked for a better day!"
V470,Forbes of Kingennie Country Resort,"On Sunday 28th October 2018 I married my best friend at this amazing resort.
From the moment we walked in to Forbes of Kingennie Country Resort we knew this was the place we wanted to make our commitment to each other.
The events team made everything easy and listened with intent as we spoke about our ideas and dreams for our speacial day, absolutely nothing was too much trouble, the staff before and on the day were attentive and amazing, we could not have asked for anything else.
Thank you to Claire and her team. thank you to Bruce for guiding us through the whole ceremony and meal, thank you to the staff who served us all that day/night you will always hold a special place in our hearts"
V470,Forbes of Kingennie Country Resort,"My husband(woohoo) and I had the most perfect day. The staff were delightful and so helpful. They really made the whole thing seamless. I would recommend Forbes to anyone whether it’s for a short stay or a wedding. Even just a meal! Absolutely fantastic, so many of our guests said it had been the best wedding they had been to."
V470,Forbes of Kingennie Country Resort,Me and my husband got married at Forbes Of Kingennie in march 2017 . The venue was beautiful . The staff were lovely and friendly and did anything for you in order for the day to run smoothly . The lodges are gorgeous . And overall a brilliant venue .
V470,Forbes of Kingennie Country Resort,"My husband and I choose Forbes of kingennie because of the beautiful setting and the boat house,

V472,Leonardo Hotel Edinburgh Murrayfield,"This venue surpassed our expectations.
The staff overlooked all our needs, the staff as a team where supportive and helpful at all times."
V472,Leonardo Hotel Edinburgh Murrayfield,"The staff at the Leonardo deserve gold medals for their work! From beginning to end the service is impeccable. Whether answering my never ending (and some times silly) questions, helping me on the day of with my ceremony seat layout, the setting up of all my decorations. Bryony and John are superhero’s. I had a family member appear and disappear within 20 minutes and Bryony was so helpful at getting him a seat at a table which then had to be removed. Everything was absolutely perfect and the staff were so helpful! 100/10 would recommend"
V472,Leonardo Hotel Edinburgh Murrayfield,"I had my wedding here on Saturday 29/3/25. It was quite a big wedding - 128 day guests with another 60 at night. I cannot fault Leonardo Murrayfield. I would not have changed a thing. Right from the first meeting with Tracey when booking the venue to the last drink from the wonderful staff on the day itself. They are prompt with any replies, professional, flexible with all the dietary requirements and what we wanted for menu. All the decorations and extra touches were 2nd to none. Bryony, Charlie and Luke on the day were fantastic. Kept everything running smoothly. I would 100% recommend this hotel for great value for money as well has having friendly, helpful staff and a beautiful meal which every guest enjoyed and commented that it was hot when served and everyone at the table served at the same time. I honestly can’t praise this hotel and staff enough for making everything just perfect!!"
V472,Leonardo Hotel Edinburgh Murrayfield,"We had our wedding reception here after having our ceremony on a different date. We arranged a viewing with Tracey, she showed us around and helped us in vision what it would look like with our theme and everything else we had planned. Tracey also gave us a list of recommended vendors for things such as DJ, events companies and cake suppliers which made it so much simpler for us when it came to booking these especially when they already had experience of setting up in the venue as knew what would look great. Straight away we knew this was the ideal venue and booked our date there and then. The communication with Tracey in the months leading up to the reception was great then we had a final meeting to go over all the little details a couple weeks before. On the day of the staff were very attentive and helpful. They even took over helping me do the decorations as I was running behind. I went to get ready and when I came down I was amazed by what a great job they’d done and how beautiful the venue looked right down to all the small details. The night ran smoothly and our guests had a great night. The buffet selection was very generous and there was a great selection for welcome drinks for our guests.
Overall it was a great experience from the very beginning with Tracey to the end of the whole event. I would definitely recommend this venue."
V472,Leonardo Hotel Edinburgh Murrayfield,"The service we received from Tracy was outstanding. Everything was so straightforward and it was everything I wanted and asked for. We all had a fantastic time and I couldn’t have asked for anything more! I had total faith in Tracy and her team, and the whole day and night went so smooth. I would absolutely recommend this place to get married. It was value for money and I didn’t have to worry about a thing, as everything was explained to me with the meetings we had and via email. I had the best day! The service from everyone, from serving the meal to the bar staff was amazing. Thank you so much for an absolute wonderful experience. We now have a friend who has also booked their wedding here for September 2025."
V472,Leonardo Hotel Edinburgh Murrayfield,From our initial meeting with Tracey to Charlie helping us on the day nothing was too much bother. Tracey was super knowledgeable and approachable. Having never organized or been involved in organizing a wedding she was so helpful and super quick at responding to my continuous emails. She had lots of contacts for other things we were looking for too. The whole package was tailored to us. We met Charlie the day before who would be looking after us on the big day and he was great. He had solutions for things I hadn't even thought to ask. I would recommend Leonardo Murrayfield to anyone wanting a wedding package tailored to them with supportive staff.
V472,Leonardo Hotel Edinburgh Murrayfield,"My wife and i had our evening reception at the Murryfield Leanardo Hotel . We were very happy with every aspect of our day. Tracey Wilson was extremely helpful and made the planning of our day very easy. We felt we were in very safe hands. Communication was great and any requests we had were accommodated with no trouble at all. The price and package we got was also very good value. We had lots of happy guests who complimented us on our venue. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for friendly, good quality service.
Mr & Mrs Wilson ♥️"
V472,Leonardo Hotel Edinburgh Murrayfield,"4 years of planning due to COVID, every time we had to push the date back, the hotel was more than happy to accommodate this, always got the same date as they knew how important it was to me and my now wife. The night it's self, ran smoother than Scotrail, John and Tracy without whom, would have been a nightmare. Bar and kitchen staff we're on point, and a great laugh and the party. 100% will recommend to others without hesitation."
V472,Leonardo Hotel Edinburgh Murrayfield,"From booking the wedding to the actual wedding day always had a quick reply always happy to help, the food was amazing the staff , nothing was no problem what you wanted you got they aim to please. Would highly recommend"
V472,Leonardo Hotel Edinburgh Murrayfield,"Lovely venue we had great wedding thank you Tracey and John.

Had short and intimate ceremony leading to lovely sit down 3 course meal and reception/ party"
V473,Dunvegan Castle & Gardens,"From day one at Dunvegan, Ro (Events Manager) was incredible. She was pleasant, professional and nothing was too much for her to organise. She took the time to show us round and as we are from out of area made sure that her responsiveness was quick both over email or by phone.
Dunvegan Castle was picturesque and our photos were perfect. Everyone had a great time and the service was exceptional."
V473,Dunvegan Castle & Gardens,"Our wedding couldn’t have been more perfect and that’s an understatement! The castle and gardens are absolutely beautiful. We have so many amazing photos. It is a bespoke location.

We cannot say enough about how helpful and welcoming all the staff at the estate were. Special thanks to Ro and Celia the event coordinators who went above and beyond our expectations :). We planned this wedding entirely from Canada with their never ending help. Thank you !"
V473,Dunvegan Castle & Gardens,The day was magical. The venue was beyond expectations and the staff went above and beyond for us. From the start the castle was a joy to work with. No request was too large. The planning process was well thought out. The staff made us feel welcomed and they felt like they were family. The accommodations on premises were AMAZING! The castle is charming and made our wedding seem like a fairy tale. There is such beauty everywhere. The grounds accented our photos and made it even more amazing. This would be my one and only choice for a Scottish wedding!

V476,Newton Hall,"We got married at Newton Hall last week and had the most perfect day! We both fell in love with Newton Hall from our first visit, they even went the extra mile and played our first dance song whilst we were walking around. When we called to book the venue the staff were so patient and they spent time making multiple personalised quotes for different dates so we could see price differences and pick the perfect date for our Wedding!
Our wedding coordinator Beth Courtier was amazing throughout the planning process, nothing was too silly, or too difficult, she even entertained my ideas about a petting zoo and prosecco ponies during our wedding drinks reception! She helped us book our family a meal the night before the big day and sorted out some last minute changes after the final meeting without a problem.
Then when we arrived to Newton Hall the night before, they were so accommodating letting us set up some decorations for the big day and the staff were so calming and reassuring. On our wedding day, Lucy and Ian were wonderful and took care of us, they made sure everything ran smoothly, arranged a first look with my grandma outside like a military operation and brought us canapes and drinks to make sure we had ate and drank something. The food was delicious and the staff were lovely.
Our only negative comment is that they didn't keep the food from our cake/ dessert table. When we left to head back up to the main hall at the end of the night there were lots of mini desserts left, the next morning we were told there were none left- assumably they'd been thrown away. But of course it wasn't the end of the world and we had a perfect wedding day! A huge thank you to all that made our day so special."
V476,Newton Hall,"The quality of service we received when planning our wedding with The Apartment Group and Newton Hall has been next level. Our queries were responded to promptly and they offered great flexibility for us to create a day we wanted. We did have a few issues arise during the planning process and they were addressed beyond satisfactory.
The venue is beautiful, with stunning grounds and well maintained. The staff are evidently very well organised as its no feat for the venue team to turn the venue around for wedding day each day.
We felt supported and looked after, our guests loved the experience and we received so many compliments on food, drink and the overall service provided. Extra shout out to the Master of Ceremonies - Andrew, and the Wedding Coordinator - Lucy. Both always with a smile and positive, can-do attitude. They ensured our day ran smoothly and were always available on hand for any questions, hiccups or simply to offer confidence on our big day."
V476,Newton Hall,"Wow what an amazing venue. Out of around 11 venues we visited, Newton Hall stood out from the beginning - we were sat down and asked what we wanted, didn’t want, offered a drink and just felt so looked after even at such an early stage in our planning. We had our day and I cannot fault one thing. The staff were amazing and did everything we asked - nothing was missed and it was exactly how we imaged and more.

Special mention to Hannah our coordinator for being so speedy with replies to any messages and questions we had. Our final meeting cleared up a lot of questions and we were never rushed to get back with answers we weren’t sure on. Her patience with us was amazing and she took the pressure off, completely understanding that things can get stressful. Lucy and Andrew on our day could not have made it go any smoother. Completely seamless service for our special day and they didn’t miss a thing. Andrew ran through everything the day before ensuring it matched our plans, communicated his part in our day very well and kept us laughing. Lucy always checked in on the morning explaining every step and was so kind throughout - nothing was a problem. All of my belongings were safely moved to our designated room and everything she communicated is exactly what happened. Marianna on the night before ensured all rooms were ready to go and was just so kind upon check in and check out. The team accommodated early access for ourselves and our guests which was organised without issues.

You can really tell the team love their jobs and know exactly how to run the perfect day. We are still getting comments from our guests days later about how great the staff were. We can’t thank them enough, we had the best day.

The Lewis’s"
V476,Newton Hall,"Newton Hall is a stunning venue and we would recommend this to anyone planning their wedding! The staff ensure every part of the day runs smoothly and communicate well on the lead up to the day and the day itself so we knew exactly what to expect.
Our wedding coordinator Beth was so helpful and always happy to help with any queries we had, big or small. She made the planning process so easy and we were confident everything would go to plan on the day!"
V476,Newton Hall,"Everyone said this was the best wedding they had ever been to. The staff were exceptional. Lucy, wedding manager was amazing, as was Andrew the MOC. EVERYONE on site and at The Joiners Arms were incredible. Everyone said this was the best wedding they had ever been to"
V476,Newton Hall,"Beth Courtier and her team at Newton Hall really made our dreams come true. Our small
Intimate wedding in this spectacular Hall and grounds was breath taking. Can’t thank them enough."
V476,Newton Hall,"We had our wedding at Newton Hall on 30th December 2024.
The day was absolutely perfect & we could not recommend Newton Hall enough.
On the lead up to our day, our wedding co-ordinator Beth was always a phone / call email away and nothing was too much of an issue. Our final details meeting was so helpful, we made a few decisions that made all the difference to our day.
On the day everything was seamless, from checking in the evening before to checking out the morning after the wedding.
Our day was perfect and we couldn't be more grateful to Newton Hall and there amazing staff for this. Everyone of our guests have complimented on the venue, the decor and the food.
Special mention to Lucy (wedding manager on our day) & Andrew (MOC) both were absolutely outstanding from start to finish and made all the difference to our day."
V476,Newton Hall,"The stand out for Newton Hall is the staff. Some of the friendliest, warmest people we have met, who really do care for you and your day. The venue is ideal, with rooms to comfortably sit, large dance floor and stunning scenes for great photos. We had a winter warmer offer and found the value to be comparable to other venues in the area. We had a wonderful day."
V476,Newton Hall,"Thank you so so much to all of the staff at Newton Hall who went above and beyond to provide a day that far exceeded all of our expectations.

Our wedding coordinator Hannah was a dream to work alongside. We felt like the only couple she was working with and made the whole planning process feel easy (it wasn’t lol).

The staff at Newton Hall were amazing on every visit beforehand and particularly on the day. Not only was the service fantastic but they went above and beyond on the day, they provided reassurance, breath spray lol and even fixed a major wardrobe malfunction for our bridesmaid.

All of our guests have complimented the food, the service and the venue and no matter how many times we say thank you it would not be enough. We were so worried about wedding blues but thanks to all the staff at the venue there is no need, it was simply perfect."
V476,Newton Hall,"We had such an amazing wedding day!

A huge shoutout to the wonderful staff who helped us in planning the day (a special thank you to Hannah), as well as the team who organised and ran the wedding day itself.

We had an absolute disaster with our wedding cake and the NH management team arranged for a cake to be baked and delivered on the morning of the wedding. Honestly, they went above and beyond!

Big love to Ian our master of ceremonies who was an absolute delight and loved by all of our guests.

All in all, what a wonderful, beautiful, day that we will treasure forever."
V477,Logie Country House,"What can I say apart from wow. This venue was completely perfect and made our day incredible. We had Gillian help with the planning and the organisation and we could trust that everything would run smoothly thanks to her hardwork and dedication. Stef and Tim (the owners) are some of the nicest people you will ever meet.
To have the venue for a couple of days was great as my family who had to travel from Somerset to attend for to relax the next day after the wedding, which made everything even more special. The amount of accommodation included was great as hardly anyone had to worry about organising taxis and it really helped my friends with young children as they could have a middle of the day nap before the evening got underway. The whole day was perfect, we couldn't recommend Logie highly enough, when can we come back for a vow renewal? 🤣 They also have onsite highland cows you can have wedding photos taken with ☺️"
V477,Logie Country House,"Couldn't recommend Logie Country House enough. It has everything you need for an amazing, chilled out wedding weekend. The owners and wedding coordinators are super responsive and helpful. The house itself is just beautiful and done to a high standard, the pool and hot tubs are an amazing addition. The perfect wedding venue."
V477,Logie Country House,"I’m not sure I can even begin to put into words how amazing our weekend - and our wedding day - was. Logie truly felt like home to us, our friends and family. I see photos now and am amazed that Logie played such a huge part in our lives. It seems so weird to look back at the first few emails we sent to arrange a viewing, to now having Logie as part of our story as a couple! I’m so sad we won’t be able to spend another weekend there.

The attention to detail was incredible. It got to a point where I knew I didn’t need to stress about organising or buying certain things, because I knew it would have been thought of by you guys. Everything went so smoothly on the wedding day, and that’s down to Lila and her hard work - so from the bottom of our hearts, thank you.

Having the opportunity to bring our family and friends together was so special. We could not have done that without you, Stef, and Tim, and all the work you’ve done to make Logie the venue it is. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!

I’m sure some people get married and their venue is simply somewhere to host their day, and their memories are more focused on their guests and each other…but for us Logie was as important and memorable as our guests, each other and everything else. I just can’t believe how perfect it all was."
V477,Logie Country House,"Logie is an absolutely stunning venue and made the perfect setting for our daughter’s special day. The management (Stef & Tim) and staff are all first class to deal with and had the house and ballroom immaculately prepped for our arrival, to set such a relaxing and comfortable environment for us all to enjoy for the whole weekend.

The Wedding day at Logie itself was perfect and huge commendation goes to the Logie team for making everything run so smoothly - our event Co-ordinator was Lila, who’s relaxed, yet clearly “on the ball” and organised demeanour made it so easy and was the key reason for the day running like clockwork - very approachable, friendly and easy to work with and even managed to accommodate one or two strange “on the hoof” requests from us too!
Having full use of the house and all its facilities (eg. Swimming pool, hot tubs etc) for the whole weekend allowed our stay over guests to relax and enjoy the surroundings in an informal environment that’s so easy to enjoy - as far as wedding venues go, this one is definitely right up there with the very best."

V477,Logie Country House,"We had our wedding here on 2nd March and it was absolutely fantastic. We couldn’t fault Logie one little bit. Everything we could ever have asked for was catered for and what a wonderful venue for our guests to enjoy and for the photos of our special day. Gillian our events manager was brilliant from booking to the day. She is responsive on emails etc, attentive and ensured our day went off without a hitch. We couldn’t recommend Logie Country House enough to house your special day.

From trip advisor"
V477,Logie Country House,"From trip advisor

My daughter and now son-in-law held their wedding ceremony & reception at Logie House in April 2019. Logie House is a fully restored Scottish mansion house with very modern facilities (indoor swimming pool, hot tubs, kitchens & bathrooms, cinema/games room) with around 15 bedrooms, set in spacious grounds with fantastic views of the surrounding hills. It is a fantastic and very unique venue for a wedding, unlike the usual ‘production line’ hotel based weddings.

We had the full use of the house for 3 days (on a self-catering basis) and the large well equipped separate function room for the wedding day. What is unique about the Logie experience is that with 15 bedrooms, multiple reception rooms and a 3 day stay, both sides of the family & friends were able to get to know each other really well - something that we all valued and is usually missing in the typical 1 day wedding.

Logie Country House – you won’t regret it."
V477,Logie Country House,"Logie was the second venue we visited after getting engaged and we knew instantly that this was where we wanted to get married. The house has 13 bedrooms so we were able to have our family and friends stay with us from Friday through to Monday and allow us time to extend the celebrations and really get the most out of our wedding buzz.

It has a lot of amenities to keep everyone busy - swimming pool, TV/games room and 2 hot tubs (which were a Godsend with 12 kids to entertain!) and several 'living rooms'. It's got it's own island and secret tree house too!
Stef and Tim are lovely hosts who are accommodating to each guest's needs. It is such a big property to manage but nothing was an issue for them. They made us feel so welcome and ensured there was always someone available to help if we needed.

We had full use of the property for the weekend so could choose whether to get married outside in the courtyard, in the house or in the ballroom. Its very flexible to let you have exactly the day you want. We were lucky to have a sunny autumn day so we wandered all over the property for our photos and the fall colours were just stunning.

Gillian, the Events Manager was brilliant. She showed us round the place a few times to get us acquainted with it all and kept the whole day running smoothly. Thank you Gillian for keeping us right!

Review from trip advisor ..."
V477,Logie Country House,"Hi Annie,


Both myself and Nav would like to express a big thank you to you and your team at Hudson's. We have had so many messages saying how amazing the food was. We didn't make it easy for you with the diverse food types, but you definitely pulled it off. Everything we asked for you made fantastically without no fuss. The Indian food especially was great, and this feedback came from the Indian guests, some of them with over 50 years of experience in cooking traditional Indian food, which goes to show how amazing a chef you are!"
V477,Logie Country House,"Hi Gillian,

Now the dust has settled and reality has kicked in, especially as I sit here at work, thinking about the weekend with a smile. Both Nav and I would just like to express our gratitude for everything you did for us to make the last few days the most magical weekend of our lives. It really was amazing from the Friday morning when we arrived until we left on Monday, and a huge part of making it run so smoothly was you and your team (as well as Stef and Tim).

We have had so many messages saying how amazing everything was, including the decor, food, organisation, and most notably the amazing Logie County House and its setting! It took many peoples breath away, including ours!

We will always look back with such fond memories, and hopefully, we will get another opportunity to visit the house again in the years to come.

So once again, thank you all and take care."
V478,Achnagairn Castle,"Myself & my husband booked this venue after our previous venue cancelled on us. from the beginning the team at Achnagairn were so supportive and helpful. Every possible step to make our wedding planning journey seamless was taken by them. On the day itself, everything was taken care of and we were well looked after. I cannot thank everyone at Achnagairn enough, our guests still talk about how amazing the venue was"
V478,Achnagairn Castle,"My partner Jess and I booked Achnagairn for our wedding venue and it was the most magical day we could ever have imagined. The venue itself is absolutely beautiful, every bedroom is so unique and the ballroom itself takes your breath away. Cara was our wedding co-ordinator and she was absolutely amazing. She kept in touch with us (while living in Australia), having frequent chats about our plans and noting everything down. Cara made sure everything went so smoothly on the day.
One thing which we loved about Achnagairn was being able to accommodate all our guests on the grounds for the whole weekend. We hired out a few Mini Manors which was enough room for all our guests to stay on site.
I cannot recommend Achnagairn highly enough as a wedding venue."

V480,Duns Castle,"These will forever remain the greatest and most magical 3 days of my life. Duns Castle is an incredible venue for a wedding. 27 of our closest family and friends travelled from Canada and everyone was blown away from their very first view of the castle. Mr & Mrs. Hay make sure that everything goes off without a hitch. They truly care about the castle and all of their guests that attend. The staff on site is also wonderful. The breakfast, bar service (they stocked the bar with whatever we wished), grounds (especially in June, the flowers on the grounds are incredible), cottages (all within walking distance and have all the necessities for a comfortable stay) and rooms (all decorated beautifully) are all impeccable. They were not opposed to any of our requests and did their absolute best to accommodate us and our wishes. I would recommend Duns Castle to anyone who wishes to get married in Scotland. We cannot wait to visit again!"
V480,Duns Castle,"We flew our closest friends and family in from the U.S. and stayed at Duns Castle for a week with the wedding ceremony at the tail end of our stay. It was a fantastic adventure to bond our families together and show them everything there is to love about Scotland. My wife and I attended the University of Edinburgh for our MS degrees and fell in love with Scotland with all its serene castles and picturesque landscapes. Knowing we wanted to marry in Scotland we took several years to plan our perfect wedding at the most beautiful castle we could find. Duns was superb in every way providing excellent accommodation, handling all our requests and suggesting various services to help our wedding and entire stay to be magical."
V480,Duns Castle,"I recently got married at Duns Castle and had a perfect wedding and a beautiful time. I searched for awhile to find the right spot, because I wanted an exclusive location that wasn't too hard to get to, had some history, and would accommodate my crazy family and friends. And Duns is perfect!!! It is even more stunning than the photos in person, if you can believe it, and the décor is simply gorgeous. You really feel as if you're staying in a historic castle and everything is beautifully maintained. We rented out the castle for a Friday/Saturday night, booked all the cottages, and had some people stay at the inn at Duns. Friday night was Kilt & Casino night in the drawing room, the company that came to the castle did an amazing job. To do dinner easily, we picked up sandwiches and pastries from the bakery in town. I also used the local florist Scentiments and I cannot recommend them enough.. On the big day, we did skeet shooting with Stuart Elworthy. We got married in the drawing room by the Scottish Registrar, and Aline perfectly arranged the room so my mother could play the grand piano as my entrance. We had Regis Catering do our dinner and I was told my multiple people it was the best catered meal they've had at a wedding. Lorraine Ross, our photographer, got some beautiful shots of us atthe lake. I had a 2 person band setup outside the dining room next to the bar and Aline arranged speakers outside for everyone to enjoy. Alot of detail, but I arranged everything by email and phone and it went perfectly. Long story short, if you want to have a beautiful wedding in a Scottish Castle, I very much recommend this venue."
V480,Duns Castle,"Perfect Wedding! The most beautiful setting you could imagine for your big day. We had to plan it long distance and Jonathan and Natalie were the best people to do so. They've organised everything for us, so we didn't have to worry about small things. They were very involved and helpful all the way through, even on our big day.

We had a small party for 50 people and it was just perfect. All of our guests stayed with us in a Castle and cottages on the grounds. Jonathan helped us to organise all the activities for the day before, like archery and croquet.

And as a surprise we were offered to plant our tree on the day. Which we did. And it was such a nice touch.

Duns Castle is not just beautiful, but truly unique experience. We can't wait to go back there to celebrate our anniversary as it is a part of our family now, not just a remarkable venue."
V480,Duns Castle,"We had an unbelievable wedding weekend/life experience at Duns Castle in early June.
Alick and Aline and the entire staff led by Natalie, Jonathan and Robert, went above and beyond in creating truly once-in-a-lifetime moments for us throughout our 4 night stay. We did an exclusive use stay with the cottages as well, and they were perfect. Activities throughout the weekend were well-organized with the help of Duns Castle; including great recommendations on restaurants, fun things to do in the area and extra lodgings in town and the surroundings. Catering and the bar at the castle was perfect, breakfast each morning was delicious and thoughtful, and everyone continuously told me how at home they felt and how much they loved the rooms and common areas – Alick and Aline are truly amazing hosts, treat everyone with such kindness and maintain the property beautifully.
The ceremony was amazing – we had it in the Drawing Room; the local florist added to an already great ambiance. The piper Duns Castle recommended was excellent and the downstairs dance room was the perfect venue for dancing after dinner and fireworks.
We hope to be back at Duns Castle often to relive the magic! Thank you Alick, Aline and everyone at Duns Castle – you are amazing!"
V480,Duns Castle,"We had our wedding at this beautiful Castle and all I can say is wow. We have just received our wedding pictures back and the memories we have of this location for the rest of our lives is just amazing. Lots of great places to walk and see with lots of character. So quiet. We felt like royalty. All our guests are still talking about how amazing this place is with its beautiful grounds, driving up to the Castle it just takes your breath away."
V480,Duns Castle,"My husband and I got married at Duns Castle in July 2016. Everything was absolutely perfect. You cannot beat this setting for your special day. The Hay family and staff are more than accommodating and make you feel that you are at home when you stay with them. As far as wedding planning, they help you every step of the way. We also stayed on the grounds for a week and, again, it was stunning. We highly recommend!!"
V480,Duns Castle,"This place, the history, and the people of Duns Castle exceeded my expectations. The beauty of this castle took my breath away when I first saw it. My daughter recently was married here. For us, it was a destination wedding that was made perfect. The hospitality of the Hay family is absolutely the best. If you are close by or traveling from the other side of the world to hold a wedding, like my family, this place needs to be on the top of your list. This was our family's unforgettable heavenly experience."
V481,Citation Weddings & Events.,"We could not have picked a more perfect venue for our wedding reception. We were obsessed with the building and decor as we wanted a contemporary, city centre wedding and Citation ticked all the boxes! Pauline was so helpful on the run up to the day by staying in contact regularly and helping us to prepare fully for our wedding. A highlight of ours was our menu tasting - it was like a private dining experience and the food was unreal!

The food was amazing, from the canapés to the wedding breakfast, and everyone commented on how much they loved it!
We were quite literally waited on the entire day and the staff in particular (especially Aidan, Darren and Robert) made us feel so special and important. The layout was great as well to allow people space to sit and chat, but also plenty of room at the dance floor - especially for our Ceilidh which went down an absolute treat!

Thanks to Citation, we had the perfect wedding day from start to finish. You helped create memories for us which will last a lifetime and every time we walk past, we will be reminded of how we celebrated the most important day of our lives in one of Glasgow’s most iconic and memorable venues."
V481,Citation Weddings & Events.,"Our wedding at Citation was perfect, we couldn’t have asked for a more relaxed day! Hannah, Aidan and Casey and the rest of the staff on the day did such a fantastic job in making sure everything ran smoothly, if anything went wrong then we had no idea!
We had so many comments from guests about how lovely the venue was, the delicious meal and how efficient everything ran. Pauline and Hannah put our minds at ease from the very first meeting, the planning stage was not really stressful at all for us as they had everything covered and made sure no small detail was forgotten, even thinking of things that would never have crossed our minds.
Thanks again to everyone at Citation, we can’t recommend them highly enough!"
V481,Citation Weddings & Events.,"Had an amazing time having our wedding at Citation. The staff were very lovely and throughout the process were great at answering our questions. We wanted to lose some of the traditional wedding elements and add in a few bits of our own, which the venue accommodated brilliantly, even though some venues won’t.

The food was great and all dietary requirements were easily catered for

Our guests even commented on how friendly, helpful and pleasant the staff were so it was great that they noticed it too and not just us as the people staff were working most directly with. They definitely went above and beyond and we are super grateful!"
V481,Citation Weddings & Events.,"We can’t thank Louize and the team at Citation enough for our incredible wedding reception party in August.

We had our dream wedding and cannot thank Louize and all the team for making the occasion unforgettable - thank you guys !"
V481,Citation Weddings & Events.,"We had our day at Citation on the 1st of August 2022 having previously switched venue from 29 Glasgow. Louize and the team are an absolute credit to Citation, Louize in particular is amazing, so accommodating, friendly and most importantly so knowledgeable and competent she really takes the pressure off and allows the couple to enjoy the planning of their day as well as the day itself. Citation is absolutely breath-taking, such a beautiful venue in the middle of Glasgow I cannot think of a single other place that could compare. The entire day of my wedding I had guests talking about how beautiful the venue was and how wonderful the staff were. The master of ceremonies was a gentleman and instantly put an anxious bride at ease! I can never thank you all enough, you absolutely gave me the day I have always dreamt of and with a team that made us feel first class all day"

For the last 6 months every time we have been into the hotel it has been an absolute pleasure, you can tell it's an amazing place because whenever we have been in it's always the same team which is rare in the leisure industry

V486,Barony Castle Hotel,"When looking for wedding venues with forestry, sadly Scotland is lacking. Thankfully we have Barony Castle Hotel. The woodland alter was absolutely stunning and sold us right away. Our day had over 100 guests and Barony handled this with grace and ease. We had a lot of requests and the staff were happy to oblige or help us to achieve our dream day. Hannah the wedding coordinator was incredible at managing the bookings and details of our day, we couldn’t have done it without her. Another I’d like to mention is Sarah, she was really brilliant on the day and helped where Hannah was elsewhere. Even our guests commented on how great the hotel we’re at handling our big family.
Our day was so so special and very unique compared to so many other weddings I see online. I cannot thank or recommend Barony and their staff enough.
Some advice to future couples:
Firstly, for peak autumn, go for the second last Saturday in October. The leaves are gorgeous if storms hold off.
Make sure you get a photographer with a drone as their map of Scotland is stunning, some friends thought our photos were AI the grounds looked so good. And lastly, enjoy your day! Barony know what they’re doing"
V486,Barony Castle Hotel,"We had the most incredible wedding weekend at Barony Castle, nothing was too much trouble, Hannah the wedding coordinator was beyond helpful and gave us great advice and guidance on the lead up to our day.
The setting was absolutely beautiful, we were really happy with the food and the staff were fantastic.
We had the use of 2 of the suites and can not fault either, they both made a gorgeous backdrop for our getting ready pictures.
We thought the barony offered excellent value for money with their wedding package and they were so flexible with lots of our different requests helping make it a stress free and fun lead up to our wedding.
I would highly recommend this venue"
V486,Barony Castle Hotel,"We chose the Barony because of the beautiful location, the friendly staff we met on that first day when reviewing possible wedding venues, the stunning grounds, the amazing wedding room along with the main function room. It provided us with the perfect Scottish wedding, that myself and my Portuguese wife were so keen to share with all our friends and family. Having such a well organised dedicated wedding planner like Hannah, took so much stress away from us. The wedding day went without a hitch, and we’ll remember it forever. Thank you Hannah, the Chef, and all the staff at The Barony. You all helped to make this our perfect Wedding day"
V486,Barony Castle Hotel,The staff were really perfect to us from planning to execution. Perfection!
V486,Barony Castle Hotel,"From initial booking to even the days after Barony Castle were absolutely brilliant, the packages they offer take all of the stress our of wedding planning with their excellent experienced suppliers just getting in touch with you directly.

Rooms were lovely, facilities at the hotel were great and the wedding coordinator there is exceptional, nothing is too big or too small and they are well practised with weddings, can't reccomend booking with them enough."
V486,Barony Castle Hotel,"We couldn’t be happier with our decision to have our wedding at Barony Castle Hotel! The venue itself is nothing short of stunning - an idyllic setting, perfect for our autumn wedding - and the exceptional service we received made our special day truly unforgettable.

Hannah played an integral role, guiding us through the entire planning process with meticulous attention to detail. On the day, her expertise ensured everything ran seamlessly, and her support was invaluable. When James took over in the evening, the transition was flawless, and we knew we were in the best hands. The entire team’s professionalism and dedication allowed us to relax and fully immerse ourselves in every moment of our special day.

The culinary experience was equally exceptional. The chef crafted three delicious menus, including an evening buffet for the guests who arrived the night before the wedding. He also took the time to personally meet with us during the tasting to discuss our dietary needs. Each dish was outstanding!

From Hannah's planning expertise to Janette’s attentive care at reception, every detail was handled beautifully. We wholeheartedly recommend Barony Castle Hotel to any couple seeking a breathtaking venue with the friendliest, first-class service.

Our heartfelt thanks to the entire team for making our wedding day so magical!

The hotel itself and the grounds are stunning and look amazing in the pics too. Every single guest commented on the venue and the team too.
V488,Western House Hotel,"My husband and I got married at western house hotel last month and were blown away with how beautiful it was and how incredibly helpful the staff all were. Laura our wedding coordinator was always at the other end of an email or phone call with all our questions and nothing was a bother to her or the amazing staff. They were all brilliant and cannot express how grateful we are to them all. The venue itself is stunning and we instantly fell in love with it after viewing a few places, we requested that the fire be lite for our ceremony which wasn’t a hassle and Laura kept me and my bridal party right. We would highly highly recommend western house hotel. They made our wedding day even more magical."

V488,Western House Hotel,"Just wanted to say a huge thank you to everyone who made our wedding day so special on 26th October. From start to finish the day was just perfect and everything went better than i expected. We arrived at the hotel the day before and from the minute we arrived we were made to feel so important. Every part of our day was looked into and we were kept up to date with everything on the day as well. The way Laura was with my Gramps was just fantastic, he doesn't keep well and she constantly checked everything was ok for him the full time. We loved this hotel for years and so glad we bit the bullet and decided to get married here. It was fantastic. Can't wait for another wee visit in the New Year."
V488,Western House Hotel,"Western House Hotel. WOW...what a TEAM.

We honestly can not thank you enough for the amazing service from beginning to end!! The most special Wedding we could have asked for. You made me feel like a Princess.

Western House Hotel you should be so proud to have such dedicated, professional, caring & immaculate staff. Shamefully we can not remember everyone's names, but here's a few of the many that made such an impact:

Jean - for dealing with me through the worst of my OCD.
Nathan - so charming, organised & nothing but a gentleman.
Laura - is just perfect. Just what every Wedding/Bride needs.
James at the Bar - for keeping the drinks flowing & ensuring all guests were happy.
James 'the butler' - for your tremendous efforts, you never stopped.
Colin - nothing was a hassle & you sure brought a smile to my face.

Bar Staff, Reception, Gardeners, Night Staff, Chefs/Cooks, Table Staff, Housemaids you made our day truly special.

A day not to be forgotten.

An Honest & Sincere ... Thank You!"
V488,Western House Hotel,"I got married at the hotel on Thursday 20th December 2012 and would like to thank all the staff for a truly perfect wedding day.

The staff were amazing, the hotel itself was beautiful as was the food. Although the weather was awful it didn't matter as the roaring log fires and stunning decorations meant that we got fantastic pictures inside.

I'd like to thank Jean for being so helpful throughout the planning stages and also to Laura who was incredible at looking after us, the day before and the day of the wedding. Every staff member was excellent and a credit to the hotel."
V488,Western House Hotel,"Had the most AMAZING wedding at Western House Hotel on 28th December 2012. Everything was perfect! The staff could not have been more helpful, the setting was SO cozy and lovely and most importantly, all of our guests had a brilliant time. We have had had lots of lovely comments from our guests about the venue and the staff asking us to pass on their thoughts about the quality of service throughout the day. So many wedding venues have become a little bit 'too big for their boots' and have lost the personal touch, but not the Western House Hotel, on the day, they will make you feel like your wedding is the only one they have all year! Love and best wishes for all of your 2013 Brides and Grooms."
V489,Ardoe House Hotel and Spa,"Ardoe proved to be the perfect venue and location for our wedding. We got lucky with the weather as it turned out to be the sunniest day of the year, but everything else went so well due to the professionalism and patience of the staff. Ours was a Scottish/Nigerian event, and they accommodated all the different cultural requests concerning our food and entertainment. This understanding, the Sunday discount, and the high standard of service throughout made it an epic day. Thank you Ardoe!"
V489,Ardoe House Hotel and Spa,I just wanted to leave a quick review to say a huge thank you to everyone at Ardoe for making our day magical.

V489,Ardoe House Hotel and Spa,"I was sat looking at wedding venues nearly a year and a half ago before coming across Ardoe House, Not for a second did i think we would be able to afford to have our wedding here.

We picked the Blair's package which came with all the extra benefits of a champagne reception, Canapes and chair covers. We hired the beautiful hotel candelabras from the hotel at a fantastic price. The hotel literally took care of everything. We were only left to worry about my dress, cake and Band! Thank you all so much for the most perfect day!"
V489,Ardoe House Hotel and Spa,"We got married here last Friday and I honestly cannot thank the staff at Ardoe enough for what was the most perfect day! I cannot think of one negative thing to say. It was a dream from start to finish.
The food that was served at our wedding was delicious, piping hot and well presented. All my guests commented on what a lovely meal it was and all dietary requirements were catered for. I requested, pies, chips and cheese for my evening buffet and it did not disappoint either. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the members of staff and they made our day go so smoothly, when asked anything the response was always ""not a problem""

I cannot recommend this hotel enough for a wedding and for a wee break, we stayed here a few times before we got married and I am already asking my new husband when we are going back as after Friday, Ardoe house really is a special place for us!

We dealt with a few wedding coordinators along the way but it was the new wedding coordinator Nicki who saw us through to the end and how amazing was she?! She replied to our emails promptly and answered our millions of questions in the lead up to the big day. Like all the staff nothing was a bother for her and she is a great asset to a wonderful team!"

V491,Kippilaw House,"We looked at venues for our wedding all cross the country but nowhere suited us better than Kippilaw. A beautiful old manor house in the Scottish countryside not only for our wedding venue but also a special week for our families to stay in.
All of the staff were extremely friendly and hospitable on our wedding day as well as leading up to it. They went above and beyond, even getting our favorite beverage that they didn’t stock in for our toast!
We can’t thank them enough for making our day so perfect.

-Oscar & Vicky"
V491,Kippilaw House,"Our recent wedding at Kippilaw House in Scotland was an absolute delight that surpassed all expectations. The whole house and ground were not only beautiful but also breathtaking whilst providing an unparalleled level of comfort, ensuring our stay was nothing short of exceptional. Kippilaw is a truly stunning place, from the gorgeous veranda that leads out to jaw dropping garden where we had our drinks reception, to the beautiful old Copper beech tree next to the house that we had our ceremony underneath.

The people who own the place and the staff are remarkably hospitable, which added a personal and welcoming touch, making our entire experience truly memorable. Rachel, the manager at Kippilaw, helped us plan our special day was beyond accommodating, catering to every odd request or question we had to truly create the dream wedding we pictured and even in the end helping us save money!
The food served was absolutely unbelievable as well, far beyond any other meals we have had at other weddings we’ve attended, it reminded us of being in a top class restaurant. Kippilaw House stands out not just as a venue but as an extraordinary destination for those seeking an unforgettable celebration. We highly recommend it for anyone desiring a perfect blend of elegance, comfort, and culinary excellence. Five stars hardly capture the sheer brilliance of our experience at Kippilaw House."
V491,Kippilaw House,"We had a fabulous day at a Wedding at Kippilaw House. The house and gardens are stunning, the service fantastic and the food was excellent. The attention to detail shone through, all in all a very unique venue."
V491,Kippilaw House,Me and my husband couldn't be more thrilled with how our wedding turned out at kippilaw! We got married last year and we still reminisce about how perfect our whole weekend was. Everything from the ceremony to the house to the food was exactly as we imagined our dream scottish wedding would be. We can't thank Lil and the team enough for their amazing hospitality and attention to detail!!
V491,Kippilaw House,"We went to the most wonderful wedding here on the 7th October 2023 and it made me wish we could get married again and come here. The quality of food and the level of attention the owners and staff gave everyone was outstanding. I cannot eat gluten and they had catered for me on every course and even on canapés so I didn’t miss out- a great place, I couldn’t rate it higher"
V491,Kippilaw House,"Had our wedding here and it was absolutely fantastic. Lil and Rachel worked with us to plan an amazing experience. Thanks to the hot weather, we were able to get married outside and it was beautiful. My partner and I didn't have to worry about a thing on the day, absolutely everything was handled for us. Food was delicious with delicious options for all dietary requirements. We actually had a full vegetarian menu and it was delicious. So many options to pick from as opposed to just adding veggie options as an afterthought. The sharing pavlova also went down a treat with everyone (including those who had to have dairy free options!). We had lots of freedom and flexibility to decorate and design our day too Thanks again to all!"
V491,Kippilaw House,"We couldn't have imagined a better venue than Kippilaw for our wedding in June. Perhaps more importantly than the beautiful setting, Lil was fantastically flexible and accommodating in enabling us to have the weekend that we wanted and the day that we dreamed of, whilst providing plenty of useful advice throughout the planning process."
V491,Kippilaw House,"We got married at Kippilaw House and had the best time ever. Rachel was the best, she was super helpful the whole time and made us feel very comfortable. We didn’t feel any pressure to do anything we didn’t want to as we skipped a lot of traditional things that didn’t match with who we are.
They were amazing at changing the menu for some of the guest with allergies. The food was lovely and everybody enjoyed it. It was really nice to stay overnight with our friends and family, it made our wedding really special.

If you want a special place for your wedding ceremony we HIGHLY recommend the ancient tree. It was magical."
V492,Marshall Meadows Manor House,"We recently got married at the hotel and it was beyond our expectations. There was moments during the organisation that we felt a little nervous our day would not go ahead with covid and also with the hotel changing hands. However, all of our concerns were soon put aside and we could not have been happier with our special day. Some of our guests arrived on the Friday evening and we were welcomed by very friendly and professional staff. We had dinner in a private dinning area which was lovely. On the big day we had exclusivity of the hotel for the rest of our guests to join. The bridal party got ready in the bridal suite which is beautiful and very spacious. The day went as planned with the hotel staff, especially Joanna and James, were excellent and kept everything in order on the day. Anything we asked was not a problem for them. The food was first class and the wedding room was stunning. We could not recommended this hotel enough. It really was the best day of our lives and we could not have done it without the help of all the staff at the hotel. The newly refurbished bedrooms and public areas are amazing and could not be faulted. All of our guests had the best time.


The Hotel is absolutely beautiful after refurb. Staff couldn't do enoight for us to make our"
V492,Marshall Meadows Manor House,"From our initial meeting at the venue to waving goodbye the day after our wedding I cannot fault Marshal Meadows Manor. The quality of food, choice, service and the venue for the price we paid was amazing. When we were looking for venues nowhere came close price wise. It’s a beautiful venue with a separate purpose built building for the ceremony with a sea view. The bridal suite is absolutely stunning. Our guests said that the wedding meal was the best they had had at a wedding and they loved the fact they got to choose their own courses (from 3 options per course). And lastly the kindness and professionalism of the staff can’t be beaten. We felt like it was a home from home. They were so warm and welcoming and helpful. I can’t recommend this venue more highly."
V492,Marshall Meadows Manor House,"Our wedding at Marshall Meadows Manor House was everything we could have wished for. The venue was absolutely beautiful, we were blessed with amazing weather and the staff were so friendly and helpful throughout the whole day! We were also so impressed with the food and several guests commented on how delicious everything was.

Our guests were also super impressed with the rooms at Marshall Meadows, the bridal suite really is so impressive and perfect for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready together.

We even got to venture down to the nearby cliffs after the ceremony to get some amazing photos along the coastline of the border.

Couldn't recommend Marshall Meadows enough! Thank you so much for making our wedding so perfect."
V492,Marshall Meadows Manor House,"This venue is an absolute gem, located with beautiful surroundings, right on the border and the coast with beautiful views. The building, inside and out is perfectly matched to its star rating and is all we wanted for our wedding. The staff are all willing to help with anything, and did everything they possibly could to ensure our big day went perfectly. If we had any queries, they were on hand to help.
All of our guests, and ourselves were extremely pleased with the way the day went, and loved every minute of it.
There is no way Marshall Meadows, or any of its staff can be faulted in any way. They take any stress and worry out of the organisation and take everything in hand to allow you to enjoy the day.
We love the place so much we will be going back, and our guests are looking forward to going back one day again.
And for the mojito and whiskey lovers out there - definitely a yes!!!!!"
V492,Marshall Meadows Manor House,"We knew after our first visit that Marshall Meadows was the venue for us.
The elegant style of the building and modern yet classic decor really stood out.
After dining here we couldn’t wait for the big day!
Picking the wedding breakfast was difficult as every dish we tried we loved.
The pizza van in the evening gave an amazing relaxed vibe and really complimented our chilled approach.
Michelle and Toyah were both fantastic and a credit to this venue.
Our day ran so smoothly and I thank them and all the staff for this.
We had the pleasure of staying for three nights, the stable suite, the bridal suite and the pods are amazing, the attention to detail is flawless.

I highly recommend this beautiful Manor House , working in the wedding industry I visit many venues in Scotland and we choose to hop the border to spend our special day here."
V493,Branxholm Park,"I was just married here in June and I cannot say enough good things about this venue or the people who truly make it shine. Over your stay here no matter how short you will immediately feel like you are a part of the family. David and Deb are so wonderfully kind, incredibly helpful, personable, and outstanding at what they do. We planned this wedding from across the pond and I didn't have to worry once about food (which was one of the best meals I had while abroad), any of the ceremony or reception sites or flowers, really they take care of so much for you it makes the day so smooth and easy! My wedding day was an absolute dream and fulfilled every LOTR elvish whim I could imagine. Again I cannot say enough good things about David and the staff at Branxholm no one went hungry and certainly not thirsty the whole weekend. All of this and the fact that there are horses, baby chicks, goats, incredible accommodations, and literally SO MUCH more makes Branxholm Park the PERFECT wedding venue. I booked site unseen, it even rained and I regret nothing."
V493,Branxholm Park,"Fantastic time at Darren & Eilidh Leslie wedding *, beautiful venue,lovely food and great staff*. Thanks for letting oscar feed the horses"
V493,Branxholm Park,"Brothers wedding so my son and I stayed the weekend along with other family members. Cannot recommend this place enough. Food was brilliant, the rooms were brilliant. Staff were so friendly, one of them even let my wee boy feed the horses on the Saturday morning. He absolutely loved it. If you are looking for a place for a wedding then this is the place"
V493,Branxholm Park,"We got married at Branxholm Park in September 2024. The venue is beautiful; a quirky, well-curated collection of indoor and outdoor spaces, ensuring nobody could ever get bored. The animals are a gorgeous inclusion - the goats and horses are so friendly, and there's a wonderfully affectionate 3-legged cat called Cookie who was the real star of our day!

We booked the venue unseen - just based on the website and video tours - as we live in South Wales so couldn't nip up to an open day. This definitely contributed to my anxiety leading up to the day, but David & Debbie assured us that lots of people book without visiting, and the house and grounds really did exceed expectations. We did gasp as we drove up the road and saw it for the first time. We were lucky to have gorgeous sunny weather and the most amazing group of guests and vendors, so despite anxieties and small oversights, it really was a perfect wedding.

The staff at the house were fantastic, making us feel so incredibly welcome from the moment we arrived. Nothing was too much trouble. A special mention to Becky and Tracey, who were just fabulous friendly faces and above-and-beyond helpful.

I would have to say, though, that the wedding would have been much easier if we'd been able to speak to Becky (the on-the-day coordinator) in advance. It would also have been nice to receive some sort of welcome pack or guide to wedding planning. All the planning is done through emails with Debbie (the owner) who was a little difficult to talk to - slow or non-existent replies, confusing typos, lack of detail, and would not provide things like a seating plan despite being asked repeatedly. Maybe she's just very relaxed because they have a template for wedding days, but as an anxious couple we could have done with better communication and some more support with finalising details of our day. Several things that Debbie agreed/assured us would happen were not communicated to Becky and the house staff - they immediately sorted things out after our arrival and a quick chat, but it was unfair that they weren't warned about updates!

It's a shame that the organisation prior to the wedding was frustrating, as Branxholm Park truly has the potential to be the greatest 5-star wedding venue. After our arrival, everything felt very fun and relaxed, and the 2-night package allowed us to settle in and explore without feeling rushed about. We made use of the hot tub and karaoke room the first night, slept well in the huge comfortable beds, and had a relaxed morning getting ready in the house without having to stress about travelling to a separate ceremony venue. The whole house-party vibe was perfect for a relaxed holiday experience without feeling stuffy or formal. Some areas could have done with a better clean and a bit of love, and one of the showers upstairs didn't seem to work, but this didn't spoil it for us.

The meal the night before the wedding was lovely; hearty burgers with chips and an incredible range of cakes. The vegan cakes were among the best we've ever tasted - the blueberry/banana and the jaffa cake were standouts! Our wedding cake was a vegan lemon and blueberry one, which tasted absolutely amazing but was a little disappointing visually - it didn't resemble the reference images we had sent, and had been covered in artificial flowers, which was honestly a little tacky.* The promised ""cake sword"" also did not appear - we were just handed a kitchen knife for our cake cutting photos - and we weren't warned that there was cardboard inside each tier (not between; inside) of the cake, which made it difficult to cut.

Breakfast and brunch were excellent, no shortage of bacon/sausage/egg/vegan rolls, jam-filled croissants, and other lovely snacks. The canapes were also lovely - a great selection including some fab Asian-fusion style bites which is apparently the chef's speciality - I wish we'd known this in advance, as it might have influenced our dinner choices. The meal on the wedding day was a little disappointing, especially the risotto, but we did take a chance by going off-menu, which was very kind of the team to accommodate. A guest particularly remarked on the high quality of the gluten-free bread rolls, and all allergies/dietary requirements were catered for. Guests were promised gluten-free gnocchi but were given pasta instead, which was still very tasty but just a bit of a shame.

*On that note - be aware that all of the florals provided as part of the venue package are artificial and re-used repeatedly. This was not an issue for us, and better than importing real flowers and the associated waste, but just worth mentioning as this isn't explicitly stated by the venue.

Our guests stayed in the flats in Hawick that are also owned by David - these had a couple of issues with cleanliness/storage space and confusing plumbing but on the whole were lovely and comfortable. One major flaw was that there is only one set of keys per flat - this is fine for the one-bed, but made it frustrating for the people in the five-bed as they were all arriving at different times.

The only other real snag was accessibility - we had a guest who uses a wheelchair, and were told that the chapel was accessible but it is actually up a steep gravel slope (not clear on the video tour) and does not have space for a wheelchair, meaning he had to sit outside for the ceremony. The only downstairs loo is also not big enough for disabled access, and the house and glasshouse both have a step at the entrance. We understand that it's an old house and as such wouldn't have been built with accessibility in mind, but just be aware!

Overall, if you love animals and are looking for a whimsical wedding getaway with endless entertainment and photo opportunities, Branxholm Park is the place for you! The package deal they offer is ideally suited to laid-back, go-with-the-flow couples who don't need fine control of every aspect of their day and are relaxed about the planning process and timeline."
V493,Branxholm Park,"We had the most magical wedding at Branxholm. The team at the venue made sure everything ran smoothly and went above and beyond on every aspect of the day. Arthur the puppy especially loved his special treatment. Our guests had a great day and said it was the best wedding they had ever attended.

It is a truly unique venue and would highly recommend it to everyone."
V493,Branxholm Park,"Our wedding at Branxholm Park in Hawick was nothing short of spectacular, thanks to the incredible team and the stunning venue itself. From the moment we arrived, we were treated to an experience that exceeded all our expectations, making our special day truly unforgettable.

Deb and David, our wedding coordinators, were phenomenal. Their expertise, attention to detail, and genuine care for our wedding were evident from our first meeting. They were instrumental in ensuring everything ran smoothly, allowing us to fully enjoy our day without any worries. Deb's thoughtful gesture of getting us food to feed the goats for our pictures was a delightful and memorable highlight, adding a unique touch to our celebration.

Jess, Tracy and the rest of the staff provided service that was nothing short of amazing. Jess, in particular, was always available to answer any questions and assist us throughout our three-day stay. Her warm and accommodating nature made us feel at ease, and she went above and beyond to ensure every aspect of our event was perfect.

The night before the wedding was incredibly relaxed, setting the tone for the rest of our stay. We all enjoyed exploring the beautiful grounds, taking a dip in the hot tub, using the karaoke room, and playing volleyball and football tennis. The relaxed atmosphere allowed us to unwind and enjoy quality time with our loved ones, making the lead-up to our big day even more special.

All our guests were captivated by the beauty of Branxholm Park. The venue's charm and elegance created the perfect backdrop for our wedding, and many guests commented on how stunning it was. The picturesque surroundings, coupled with the well-maintained and beautifully decorated spaces, made for an enchanting setting that will forever be etched in our memories.

The canapés served at our wedding were a standout feature, with numerous guests raving about their quality and taste. Each bite was a culinary delight, reflecting the high standards of Branxholm Park's catering. The attention to detail in the presentation and the exquisite flavours truly impressed everyone, adding to the overall excellence of our wedding experience. I know that the Bestman tried his best to eat as many unlimited canapés as he could and at one point have 5 finished risotto spoons in his hand.

One of the most memorable aspects of our wedding was the opportunity to interact with the goats during our photo session, thanks to Deb who brought out goat food to attract them over. This unique and personal touch made our day even more special and provided us with cherished memories and wonderful photos.

Branxholm Park is an exceptional wedding venue that combines breathtaking beauty with outstanding service. All of the staff played crucial roles in making our wedding day perfect, and we are incredibly grateful for their dedication and hard work. We highly recommend Branxholm Park to anyone seeking a magical and unforgettable wedding experience. The intimate venue was beautiful, had a very relaxed vibe, and served great food and extremely tasty cakes! Thank you to all at Branxholm Park for making our dream wedding a reality."
V493,Branxholm Park,"Two weeks ago we got married at this stunning venue! 😍
From start to finish they couldn't do enough for us.
All of our guests described the day as
‘Magical’ 🥹 and honestly it really did feel like that!
David, thank you from the Friday we arrived you were very good with us all and made sure we had everything and nothing was a problem to them!
Your staff are so lovely too, especially the lady who was doing the room cleans. Sorry i have forgot her name but she was so good with the children too.

I would 100% recommend getting a reception drinks singer and a dj for the evening!

Overall from start to finish the price / package was just perfect so thank you so so much xxi"
V493,Branxholm Park,"Just arrived home after our wedding here at Branxholm Park. The venue was absolutely perfect, everything had been thought of. Everywhere you looked you’d find a stunning little area that made the place feel so whimsical. David & Debs are fantastic hosts, nothing was a problem and they were at hand not only on the lead up to the wedding but also throughout our stay to make sure everything went to plan. The wedding package is great and made everything feel so stress free. The staff were brilliant, so helpful and just fit into the day to make sure everything ticked along nicely. Hats off to the chef, the food was out of this world!!

We can’t recommend this place enough, a magical wedding venue!

Thank you again for everything!"
V493,Branxholm Park,"My husband and I got married here just days ago.

We came a long way from London, and took a gamble having never seen the venue in person before. Let me tell you; as our minibus ambled round the corner and Branxholm Park came into view, we all gasped. It’s just stunning. Truly something out of a fairytale.

We were given the warmest of welcomes by the wonderful Tracey, who had also helped our other guests to their rooms. Actually, she was, along with too many other points to mention, a highlight of our wedding experience. Tracey couldn’t do too much for us; she was such an Angel. She looked after our party so well that she was a fond topic of conversation on the way home! We love you Tracey!

I then caught up with David, who ran through every aspect of the following day with me, ensuring that everything we wanted and needed was in place. Again, I need to shout out to him because he checked on me consistently throughout the day, and was a huge hit with the kids; taking them with him armed with carrots to see the horses, and generally being fantastic. If you’re nervous or full of emotions then you need someone steady and calm like David to see you through!

The chapel was adorned with florals of our colour choice, and was something out of a true fairytale. With twinkling fairy lights and gorgeous details!

Each of our rooms were designed with a different theme in mind and were so luxurious and stunning that we didn’t want to leave. No, really!

The grounds are huge, and there is so much to do; our groomsmen spent the wedding morning using the spa facilities whilst the kids fell in love with the goats and outdoor playground.

The head chef, Jamie, was a hilarious sweetheart who as a fellow south Londoner I loved bantering with! The food was sublime.

I think I could spend all day writing about all the wonderful things that made our day so special. But alas, word limits. If you’re thinking about getting married here. Just do it. These memories will last us a lifetime; our guests, too. Best wedding I’ve ever been to and it was my own!

To David, Deb, Tracey, Jamie and ALL the wonderful staff (Jess, for holding my veil!!) we’d like to thank you from the bottom of our hearts for playing such a massive role in making our day the best ever. ♥️♥️"
V493,Branxholm Park,"When selecting a wedding venue, after doing our research we decided to visit Branxholm Park as it ticked all our boxes - it catered for a more intimate size of wedding, it was exclusive use, and it had on site accommodation. We thought it looked beautiful on the website - as Michael put ""a bit like where the elves in Lord of the Rings"" would dine"".

When we visited, we knew very quickly that this was our perfect place, so much so that we never viewed any other venues! We could instantly envision ourselves an our guests celebrating here on our wedding weekend, staying in the beautiful rooms and chilling in the sauna. Michael's only question was - will there be dessert? However after sampling some of the delicious cakes that Deb made, we were more than satisfied that this was a yes.

When we arrived at the venue on the eve of our wedding, David was there to put our wedding nerves at ease. We were free to explore the venue, and to share all the rooms, features and animals with our families and friends. Our niece and nephew loved the mini cinema on the top floor, and were endlessly amused for the whole weekend. The Bring Your Own Booze option worked very well, with the groom party enjoying a few drinks then night before (until 3am!).

On the wedding day itself, myself and the bridal party opted for the oriental room to get ready in, though there were plenty of other options. Tracy looked after us, bringing coffees, breakfast, lunch and some fizz while we were getting ready.

The venue has a beautiful mini chapel which we got married in. As it was a gorgeous sunny day, our guests were able to make full use of the lovely grounds to enjoy a drink before and after the ceremony. Our photographers were delighted with so many options for stunning backdrops.

The wedding meal was fantastic. We enjoyed the (competitive) champagne fountain, and the dining room itself was beautiful. We added our own finishing touches to each table - favours and ""wedding trump"" cards - however they were already beautiful with nothing more needed.

One thing I would say is that you and your guests will never go hungry. The catering team did an amazing job on the meal itself, and kept us fed throughout the night with rolls, chips (according to several of our guests - the best chips they had ever eaten) and cake. They also catered to various allergies, intolerances and tastes.

The disco room worked very well. Our music connected easily to the speaker system, and we danced the night away. Our guests enjoyed playing barperson, and the drinks were flowing.
What I enjoyed most about the after party is that there was something for everyone - it was lovely to see our dad's playing a game of table tennis, and our friends singing karaoke with silly hats on. This is the perfect set up for extraverts and introverts alike!

Overall, I would recommend Branxholm Park if you are seeking a more intimate wedding with your closest family and friends. They managed to capture a house party vibe while adding a taste of luxury and a touch of magic. We could not have asked for a better day!"
V494,Forbes of Kingennie Country Resort,"On Sunday 28th October 2018 I married my best friend at this amazing resort.
From the moment we walked in to Forbes of Kingennie Country Resort we knew this was the place we wanted to make our commitment to each other.
The events team made everything easy and listened with intent as we spoke about our ideas and dreams for our speacial day, absolutely nothing was too much trouble, the staff before and on the day were attentive and amazing, we could not have asked for anything else.
Thank you to Claire and her team. thank you to Bruce for guiding us through the whole ceremony and meal, thank you to the staff who served us all that day/night you will always hold a special place in our hearts"
V494,Forbes of Kingennie Country Resort,"My husband(woohoo) and I had the most perfect day. The staff were delightful and so helpful. They really made the whole thing seamless. I would recommend Forbes to anyone whether it’s for a short stay or a wedding. Even just a meal! Absolutely fantastic, so many of our guests said it had been the best wedding they had been to."
V494,Forbes of Kingennie Country Resort,Me and my husband got married at Forbes Of Kingennie in march 2017 . The venue was beautiful . The staff were lovely and friendly and did anything for you in order for the day to run smoothly . The lodges are gorgeous . And overall a brilliant venue .

V496,Leonardo Hotel Edinburgh Murrayfield,"This venue surpassed our expectations.
The staff overlooked all our needs, the staff as a team where supportive and helpful at all times."
V496,Leonardo Hotel Edinburgh Murrayfield,"The staff at the Leonardo deserve gold medals for their work! From beginning to end the service is impeccable. Whether answering my never ending (and some times silly) questions, helping me on the day of with my ceremony seat layout, the setting up of all my decorations. Bryony and John are superhero’s. I had a family member appear and disappear within 20 minutes and Bryony was so helpful at getting him a seat at a table which then had to be removed. Everything was absolutely perfect and the staff were so helpful! 100/10 would recommend"
V496,Leonardo Hotel Edinburgh Murrayfield,"I had my wedding here on Saturday 29/3/25. It was quite a big wedding - 128 day guests with another 60 at night. I cannot fault Leonardo Murrayfield. I would not have changed a thing. Right from the first meeting with Tracey when booking the venue to the last drink from the wonderful staff on the day itself. They are prompt with any replies, professional, flexible with all the dietary requirements and what we wanted for menu. All the decorations and extra touches were 2nd to none. Bryony, Charlie and Luke on the day were fantastic. Kept everything running smoothly. I would 100% recommend this hotel for great value for money as well has having friendly, helpful staff and a beautiful meal which every guest enjoyed and commented that it was hot when served and everyone at the table served at the same time. I honestly can’t praise this hotel and staff enough for making everything just perfect!!"
V496,Leonardo Hotel Edinburgh Murrayfield,"We had our wedding reception here after having our ceremony on a different date. We arranged a viewing with Tracey, she showed us around and helped us in vision what it would look like with our theme and everything else we had planned. Tracey also gave us a list of recommended vendors for things such as DJ, events companies and cake suppliers which made it so much simpler for us when it came to booking these especially when they already had experience of setting up in the venue as knew what would look great. Straight away we knew this was the ideal venue and booked our date there and then. The communication with Tracey in the months leading up to the reception was great then we had a final meeting to go over all the little details a couple weeks before. On the day of the staff were very attentive and helpful. They even took over helping me do the decorations as I was running behind. I went to get ready and when I came down I was amazed by what a great job they’d done and how beautiful the venue looked right down to all the small details. The night ran smoothly and our guests had a great night. The buffet selection was very generous and there was a great selection for welcome drinks for our guests.
Overall it was a great experience from the very beginning with Tracey to the end of the whole event. I would definitely recommend this venue."
V496,Leonardo Hotel Edinburgh Murrayfield,"The service we received from Tracy was outstanding. Everything was so straightforward and it was everything I wanted and asked for. We all had a fantastic time and I couldn’t have asked for anything more! I had total faith in Tracy and her team, and the whole day and night went so smooth. I would absolutely recommend this place to get married. It was value for money and I didn’t have to worry about a thing, as everything was explained to me with the meetings we had and via email. I had the best day! The service from everyone, from serving the meal to the bar staff was amazing. Thank you so much for an absolute wonderful experience. We now have a friend who has also booked their wedding here for September 2025."
V496,Leonardo Hotel Edinburgh Murrayfield,From our initial meeting with Tracey to Charlie helping us on the day nothing was too much bother. Tracey was super knowledgeable and approachable. Having never organized or been involved in organizing a wedding she was so helpful and super quick at responding to my continuous emails. She had lots of contacts for other things we were looking for too. The whole package was tailored to us. We met Charlie the day before who would be looking after us on the big day and he was great. He had solutions for things I hadn't even thought to ask. I would recommend Leonardo Murrayfield to anyone wanting a wedding package tailored to them with supportive staff.
V496,Leonardo Hotel Edinburgh Murrayfield,"My wife and i had our evening reception at the Murryfield Leanardo Hotel . We were very happy with every aspect of our day. Tracey Wilson was extremely helpful and made the planning of our day very easy. We felt we were in very safe hands. Communication was great and any requests we had were accommodated with no trouble at all. The price and package we got was also very good value. We had lots of happy guests who complimented us on our venue. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for friendly, good quality service.
Mr & Mrs Wilson ♥️"
V496,Leonardo Hotel Edinburgh Murrayfield,"4 years of planning due to COVID, every time we had to push the date back, the hotel was more than happy to accommodate this, always got the same date as they knew how important it was to me and my now wife. The night it's self, ran smoother than Scotrail, John and Tracy without whom, would have been a nightmare. Bar and kitchen staff we're on point, and a great laugh and the party. 100% will recommend to others without hesitation."
V496,Leonardo Hotel Edinburgh Murrayfield,"From booking the wedding to the actual wedding day always had a quick reply always happy to help, the food was amazing the staff , nothing was no problem what you wanted you got they aim to please. Would highly recommend"
V496,Leonardo Hotel Edinburgh Murrayfield,"Lovely venue we had great wedding thank you Tracey and John.

Had short and intimate ceremony leading to lovely sit down 3 course meal and reception/ party"
V497,Dunvegan Castle & Gardens,"From day one at Dunvegan, Ro (Events Manager) was incredible. She was pleasant, professional and nothing was too much for her to organise. She took the time to show us round and as we are from out of area made sure that her responsiveness was quick both over email or by phone.
Dunvegan Castle was picturesque and our photos were perfect. Everyone had a great time and the service was exceptional."
V497,Dunvegan Castle & Gardens,"Our wedding couldn’t have been more perfect and that’s an understatement! The castle and gardens are absolutely beautiful. We have so many amazing photos. It is a bespoke location.

We cannot say enough about how helpful and welcoming all the staff at the estate were. Special thanks to Ro and Celia the event coordinators who went above and beyond our expectations :). We planned this wedding entirely from Canada with their never ending help. Thank you !"
V497,Dunvegan Castle & Gardens,The day was magical. The venue was beyond expectations and the staff went above and beyond for us. From the start the castle was a joy to work with. No request was too large. The planning process was well thought out. The staff made us feel welcomed and they felt like they were family. The accommodations on premises were AMAZING! The castle is charming and made our wedding seem like a fairy tale. There is such beauty everywhere. The grounds accented our photos and made it even more amazing. This would be my one and only choice for a Scottish wedding!

V500,Newton Hall,"We got married at Newton Hall last week and had the most perfect day! We both fell in love with Newton Hall from our first visit, they even went the extra mile and played our first dance song whilst we were walking around. When we called to book the venue the staff were so patient and they spent time making multiple personalised quotes for different dates so we could see price differences and pick the perfect date for our Wedding!
Our wedding coordinator Beth Courtier was amazing throughout the planning process, nothing was too silly, or too difficult, she even entertained my ideas about a petting zoo and prosecco ponies during our wedding drinks reception! She helped us book our family a meal the night before the big day and sorted out some last minute changes after the final meeting without a problem.
Then when we arrived to Newton Hall the night before, they were so accommodating letting us set up some decorations for the big day and the staff were so calming and reassuring. On our wedding day, Lucy and Ian were wonderful and took care of us, they made sure everything ran smoothly, arranged a first look with my grandma outside like a military operation and brought us canapes and drinks to make sure we had ate and drank something. The food was delicious and the staff were lovely.
Our only negative comment is that they didn't keep the food from our cake/ dessert table. When we left to head back up to the main hall at the end of the night there were lots of mini desserts left, the next morning we were told there were none left- assumably they'd been thrown away. But of course it wasn't the end of the world and we had a perfect wedding day! A huge thank you to all that made our day so special."
V500,Newton Hall,"The quality of service we received when planning our wedding with The Apartment Group and Newton Hall has been next level. Our queries were responded to promptly and they offered great flexibility for us to create a day we wanted. We did have a few issues arise during the planning process and they were addressed beyond satisfactory.
The venue is beautiful, with stunning grounds and well maintained. The staff are evidently very well organised as its no feat for the venue team to turn the venue around for wedding day each day.
We felt supported and looked after, our guests loved the experience and we received so many compliments on food, drink and the overall service provided. Extra shout out to the Master of Ceremonies - Andrew, and the Wedding Coordinator - Lucy. Both always with a smile and positive, can-do attitude. They ensured our day ran smoothly and were always available on hand for any questions, hiccups or simply to offer confidence on our big day."
V500,Newton Hall,"Wow what an amazing venue. Out of around 11 venues we visited, Newton Hall stood out from the beginning - we were sat down and asked what we wanted, didn’t want, offered a drink and just felt so looked after even at such an early stage in our planning. We had our day and I cannot fault one thing. The staff were amazing and did everything we asked - nothing was missed and it was exactly how we imaged and more.

Special mention to Hannah our coordinator for being so speedy with replies to any messages and questions we had. Our final meeting cleared up a lot of questions and we were never rushed to get back with answers we weren’t sure on. Her patience with us was amazing and she took the pressure off, completely understanding that things can get stressful. Lucy and Andrew on our day could not have made it go any smoother. Completely seamless service for our special day and they didn’t miss a thing. Andrew ran through everything the day before ensuring it matched our plans, communicated his part in our day very well and kept us laughing. Lucy always checked in on the morning explaining every step and was so kind throughout - nothing was a problem. All of my belongings were safely moved to our designated room and everything she communicated is exactly what happened. Marianna on the night before ensured all rooms were ready to go and was just so kind upon check in and check out. The team accommodated early access for ourselves and our guests which was organised without issues.

You can really tell the team love their jobs and know exactly how to run the perfect day. We are still getting comments from our guests days later about how great the staff were. We can’t thank them enough, we had the best day.

The Lewis’s"
V500,Newton Hall,"Newton Hall is a stunning venue and we would recommend this to anyone planning their wedding! The staff ensure every part of the day runs smoothly and communicate well on the lead up to the day and the day itself so we knew exactly what to expect.
Our wedding coordinator Beth was so helpful and always happy to help with any queries we had, big or small. She made the planning process so easy and we were confident everything would go to plan on the day!"
V500,Newton Hall,"Everyone said this was the best wedding they had ever been to. The staff were exceptional. Lucy, wedding manager was amazing, as was Andrew the MOC. EVERYONE on site and at The Joiners Arms were incredible. Everyone said this was the best wedding they had ever been to"
V500,Newton Hall,"Beth Courtier and her team at Newton Hall really made our dreams come true. Our small
Intimate wedding in this spectacular Hall and grounds was breath taking. Can’t thank them enough."
V500,Newton Hall,"We had our wedding at Newton Hall on 30th December 2024.
The day was absolutely perfect & we could not recommend Newton Hall enough.
On the lead up to our day, our wedding co-ordinator Beth was always a phone / call email away and nothing was too much of an issue. Our final details meeting was so helpful, we made a few decisions that made all the difference to our day.
On the day everything was seamless, from checking in the evening before to checking out the morning after the wedding.
Our day was perfect and we couldn't be more grateful to Newton Hall and there amazing staff for this. Everyone of our guests have complimented on the venue, the decor and the food.
Special mention to Lucy (wedding manager on our day) & Andrew (MOC) both were absolutely outstanding from start to finish and made all the difference to our day."
V500,Newton Hall,"The stand out for Newton Hall is the staff. Some of the friendliest, warmest people we have met, who really do care for you and your day. The venue is ideal, with rooms to comfortably sit, large dance floor and stunning scenes for great photos. We had a winter warmer offer and found the value to be comparable to other venues in the area. We had a wonderful day."
V500,Newton Hall,"Thank you so so much to all of the staff at Newton Hall who went above and beyond to provide a day that far exceeded all of our expectations.

Our wedding coordinator Hannah was a dream to work alongside. We felt like the only couple she was working with and made the whole planning process feel easy (it wasn’t lol).

The staff at Newton Hall were amazing on every visit beforehand and particularly on the day. Not only was the service fantastic but they went above and beyond on the day, they provided reassurance, breath spray lol and even fixed a major wardrobe malfunction for our bridesmaid.

All of our guests have complimented the food, the service and the venue and no matter how many times we say thank you it would not be enough. We were so worried about wedding blues but thanks to all the staff at the venue there is no need, it was simply perfect."
V500,Newton Hall,"We had such an amazing wedding day!

A huge shoutout to the wonderful staff who helped us in planning the day (a special thank you to Hannah), as well as the team who organised and ran the wedding day itself.

We had an absolute disaster with our wedding cake and the NH management team arranged for a cake to be baked and delivered on the morning of the wedding. Honestly, they went above and beyond!

Big love to Ian our master of ceremonies who was an absolute delight and loved by all of our guests.

All in all, what a wonderful, beautiful, day that we will treasure forever."
V501,Logie Country House,"What can I say apart from wow. This venue was completely perfect and made our day incredible. We had Gillian help with the planning and the organisation and we could trust that everything would run smoothly thanks to her hardwork and dedication. Stef and Tim (the owners) are some of the nicest people you will ever meet.
To have the venue for a couple of days was great as my family who had to travel from Somerset to attend for to relax the next day after the wedding, which made everything even more special. The amount of accommodation included was great as hardly anyone had to worry about organising taxis and it really helped my friends with young children as they could have a middle of the day nap before the evening got underway. The whole day was perfect, we couldn't recommend Logie highly enough, when can we come back for a vow renewal? 🤣 They also have onsite highland cows you can have wedding photos taken with ☺️"
V501,Logie Country House,"Couldn't recommend Logie Country House enough. It has everything you need for an amazing, chilled out wedding weekend. The owners and wedding coordinators are super responsive and helpful. The house itself is just beautiful and done to a high standard, the pool and hot tubs are an amazing addition. The perfect wedding venue."
V501,Logie Country House,"I’m not sure I can even begin to put into words how amazing our weekend - and our wedding day - was. Logie truly felt like home to us, our friends and family. I see photos now and am amazed that Logie played such a huge part in our lives. It seems so weird to look back at the first few emails we sent to arrange a viewing, to now having Logie as part of our story as a couple! I’m so sad we won’t be able to spend another weekend there.

The attention to detail was incredible. It got to a point where I knew I didn’t need to stress about organising or buying certain things, because I knew it would have been thought of by you guys. Everything went so smoothly on the wedding day, and that’s down to Lila and her hard work - so from the bottom of our hearts, thank you.

Having the opportunity to bring our family and friends together was so special. We could not have done that without you, Stef, and Tim, and all the work you’ve done to make Logie the venue it is. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!

I’m sure some people get married and their venue is simply somewhere to host their day, and their memories are more focused on their guests and each other…but for us Logie was as important and memorable as our guests, each other and everything else. I just can’t believe how perfect it all was."
V501,Logie Country House,"Logie is an absolutely stunning venue and made the perfect setting for our daughter’s special day. The management (Stef & Tim) and staff are all first class to deal with and had the house and ballroom immaculately prepped for our arrival, to set such a relaxing and comfortable environment for us all to enjoy for the whole weekend.

The Wedding day at Logie itself was perfect and huge commendation goes to the Logie team for making everything run so smoothly - our event Co-ordinator was Lila, who’s relaxed, yet clearly “on the ball” and organised demeanour made it so easy and was the key reason for the day running like clockwork - very approachable, friendly and easy to work with and even managed to accommodate one or two strange “on the hoof” requests from us too!
Having full use of the house and all its facilities (eg. Swimming pool, hot tubs etc) for the whole weekend allowed our stay over guests to relax and enjoy the surroundings in an informal environment that’s so easy to enjoy - as far as wedding venues go, this one is definitely right up there with the very best."
V501,Logie Country House,Yay us. Top Tier Winner of Best Exclusive Use Wedding Venue 2019 as voted for by our 2019 brides & rooms
V501,Logie Country House,"We had our wedding here on 2nd March and it was absolutely fantastic. We couldn’t fault Logie one little bit. Everything we could ever have asked for was catered for and what a wonderful venue for our guests to enjoy and for the photos of our special day. Gillian our events manager was brilliant from booking to the day. She is responsive on emails etc, attentive and ensured our day went off without a hitch. We couldn’t recommend Logie Country House enough to house your special day.

From trip advisor"
V501,Logie Country House,"From trip advisor

My daughter and now son-in-law held their wedding ceremony & reception at Logie House in April 2019. Logie House is a fully restored Scottish mansion house with very modern facilities (indoor swimming pool, hot tubs, kitchens & bathrooms, cinema/games room) with around 15 bedrooms, set in spacious grounds with fantastic views of the surrounding hills. It is a fantastic and very unique venue for a wedding, unlike the usual ‘production line’ hotel based weddings.

We had the full use of the house for 3 days (on a self-catering basis) and the large well equipped separate function room for the wedding day. What is unique about the Logie experience is that with 15 bedrooms, multiple reception rooms and a 3 day stay, both sides of the family & friends were able to get to know each other really well - something that we all valued and is usually missing in the typical 1 day wedding.

Logie Country House – you won’t regret it."
V501,Logie Country House,"Logie was the second venue we visited after getting engaged and we knew instantly that this was where we wanted to get married. The house has 13 bedrooms so we were able to have our family and friends stay with us from Friday through to Monday and allow us time to extend the celebrations and really get the most out of our wedding buzz.

It has a lot of amenities to keep everyone busy - swimming pool, TV/games room and 2 hot tubs (which were a Godsend with 12 kids to entertain!) and several 'living rooms'. It's got it's own island and secret tree house too!
Stef and Tim are lovely hosts who are accommodating to each guest's needs. It is such a big property to manage but nothing was an issue for them. They made us feel so welcome and ensured there was always someone available to help if we needed.

We had full use of the property for the weekend so could choose whether to get married outside in the courtyard, in the house or in the ballroom. Its very flexible to let you have exactly the day you want. We were lucky to have a sunny autumn day so we wandered all over the property for our photos and the fall colours were just stunning.

Gillian, the Events Manager was brilliant. She showed us round the place a few times to get us acquainted with it all and kept the whole day running smoothly. Thank you Gillian for keeping us right!

Review from trip advisor ..."
V501,Logie Country House,"Hi Annie,


Both myself and Nav would like to express a big thank you to you and your team at Hudson's. We have had so many messages saying how amazing the food was. We didn't make it easy for you with the diverse food types, but you definitely pulled it off. Everything we asked for you made fantastically without no fuss. The Indian food especially was great, and this feedback came from the Indian guests, some of them with over 50 years of experience in cooking traditional Indian food, which goes to show how amazing a chef you are!"
V501,Logie Country House,"Hi Gillian,

Now the dust has settled and reality has kicked in, especially as I sit here at work, thinking about the weekend with a smile. Both Nav and I would just like to express our gratitude for everything you did for us to make the last few days the most magical weekend of our lives. It really was amazing from the Friday morning when we arrived until we left on Monday, and a huge part of making it run so smoothly was you and your team (as well as Stef and Tim).

We have had so many messages saying how amazing everything was, including the decor, food, organisation, and most notably the amazing Logie County House and its setting! It took many peoples breath away, including ours!

We will always look back with such fond memories, and hopefully, we will get another opportunity to visit the house again in the years to come.

So once again, thank you all and take care."
V502,Achnagairn Castle,"Myself & my husband booked this venue after our previous venue cancelled on us. from the beginning the team at Achnagairn were so supportive and helpful. Every possible step to make our wedding planning journey seamless was taken by them. On the day itself, everything was taken care of and we were well looked after. I cannot thank everyone at Achnagairn enough, our guests still talk about how amazing the venue was"
V502,Achnagairn Castle,"My partner Jess and I booked Achnagairn for our wedding venue and it was the most magical day we could ever have imagined. The venue itself is absolutely beautiful, every bedroom is so unique and the ballroom itself takes your breath away. Cara was our wedding co-ordinator and she was absolutely amazing. She kept in touch with us (while living in Australia), having frequent chats about our plans and noting everything down. Cara made sure everything went so smoothly on the day.
One thing which we loved about Achnagairn was being able to accommodate all our guests on the grounds for the whole weekend. We hired out a few Mini Manors which was enough room for all our guests to stay on site.
I cannot recommend Achnagairn highly enough as a wedding venue."
V503,The Engine Works,N/A
V504,Duns Castle,"These will forever remain the greatest and most magical 3 days of my life. Duns Castle is an incredible venue for a wedding. 27 of our closest family and friends travelled from Canada and everyone was blown away from their very first view of the castle. Mr & Mrs. Hay make sure that everything goes off without a hitch. They truly care about the castle and all of their guests that attend. The staff on site is also wonderful. The breakfast, bar service (they stocked the bar with whatever we wished), grounds (especially in June, the flowers on the grounds are incredible), cottages (all within walking distance and have all the necessities for a comfortable stay) and rooms (all decorated beautifully) are all impeccable. They were not opposed to any of our requests and did their absolute best to accommodate us and our wishes. I would recommend Duns Castle to anyone who wishes to get married in Scotland. We cannot wait to visit again!"
V504,Duns Castle,"We flew our closest friends and family in from the U.S. and stayed at Duns Castle for a week with the wedding ceremony at the tail end of our stay. It was a fantastic adventure to bond our families together and show them everything there is to love about Scotland. My wife and I attended the University of Edinburgh for our MS degrees and fell in love with Scotland with all its serene castles and picturesque landscapes. Knowing we wanted to marry in Scotland we took several years to plan our perfect wedding at the most beautiful castle we could find. Duns was superb in every way providing excellent accommodation, handling all our requests and suggesting various services to help our wedding and entire stay to be magical."
V504,Duns Castle,"I recently got married at Duns Castle and had a perfect wedding and a beautiful time. I searched for awhile to find the right spot, because I wanted an exclusive location that wasn't too hard to get to, had some history, and would accommodate my crazy family and friends. And Duns is perfect!!! It is even more stunning than the photos in person, if you can believe it, and the décor is simply gorgeous. You really feel as if you're staying in a historic castle and everything is beautifully maintained. We rented out the castle for a Friday/Saturday night, booked all the cottages, and had some people stay at the inn at Duns. Friday night was Kilt & Casino night in the drawing room, the company that came to the castle did an amazing job. To do dinner easily, we picked up sandwiches and pastries from the bakery in town. I also used the local florist Scentiments and I cannot recommend them enough.. On the big day, we did skeet shooting with Stuart Elworthy. We got married in the drawing room by the Scottish Registrar, and Aline perfectly arranged the room so my mother could play the grand piano as my entrance. We had Regis Catering do our dinner and I was told my multiple people it was the best catered meal they've had at a wedding. Lorraine Ross, our photographer, got some beautiful shots of us atthe lake. I had a 2 person band setup outside the dining room next to the bar and Aline arranged speakers outside for everyone to enjoy. Alot of detail, but I arranged everything by email and phone and it went perfectly. Long story short, if you want to have a beautiful wedding in a Scottish Castle, I very much recommend this venue."
V504,Duns Castle,"Perfect Wedding! The most beautiful setting you could imagine for your big day. We had to plan it long distance and Jonathan and Natalie were the best people to do so. They've organised everything for us, so we didn't have to worry about small things. They were very involved and helpful all the way through, even on our big day.

We had a small party for 50 people and it was just perfect. All of our guests stayed with us in a Castle and cottages on the grounds. Jonathan helped us to organise all the activities for the day before, like archery and croquet.

And as a surprise we were offered to plant our tree on the day. Which we did. And it was such a nice touch.

Duns Castle is not just beautiful, but truly unique experience. We can't wait to go back there to celebrate our anniversary as it is a part of our family now, not just a remarkable venue."
V504,Duns Castle,"We had an unbelievable wedding weekend/life experience at Duns Castle in early June.
Alick and Aline and the entire staff led by Natalie, Jonathan and Robert, went above and beyond in creating truly once-in-a-lifetime moments for us throughout our 4 night stay. We did an exclusive use stay with the cottages as well, and they were perfect. Activities throughout the weekend were well-organized with the help of Duns Castle; including great recommendations on restaurants, fun things to do in the area and extra lodgings in town and the surroundings. Catering and the bar at the castle was perfect, breakfast each morning was delicious and thoughtful, and everyone continuously told me how at home they felt and how much they loved the rooms and common areas – Alick and Aline are truly amazing hosts, treat everyone with such kindness and maintain the property beautifully.
The ceremony was amazing – we had it in the Drawing Room; the local florist added to an already great ambiance. The piper Duns Castle recommended was excellent and the downstairs dance room was the perfect venue for dancing after dinner and fireworks.
We hope to be back at Duns Castle often to relive the magic! Thank you Alick, Aline and everyone at Duns Castle – you are amazing!"
V504,Duns Castle,"We had our wedding at this beautiful Castle and all I can say is wow. We have just received our wedding pictures back and the memories we have of this location for the rest of our lives is just amazing. Lots of great places to walk and see with lots of character. So quiet. We felt like royalty. All our guests are still talking about how amazing this place is with its beautiful grounds, driving up to the Castle it just takes your breath away."
V504,Duns Castle,"My husband and I got married at Duns Castle in July 2016. Everything was absolutely perfect. You cannot beat this setting for your special day. The Hay family and staff are more than accommodating and make you feel that you are at home when you stay with them. As far as wedding planning, they help you every step of the way. We also stayed on the grounds for a week and, again, it was stunning. We highly recommend!!"
V504,Duns Castle,"This place, the history, and the people of Duns Castle exceeded my expectations. The beauty of this castle took my breath away when I first saw it. My daughter recently was married here. For us, it was a destination wedding that was made perfect. The hospitality of the Hay family is absolutely the best. If you are close by or traveling from the other side of the world to hold a wedding, like my family, this place needs to be on the top of your list. This was our family's unforgettable heavenly experience."
V505,Citation Weddings & Events.,"We could not have picked a more perfect venue for our wedding reception. We were obsessed with the building and decor as we wanted a contemporary, city centre wedding and Citation ticked all the boxes! Pauline was so helpful on the run up to the day by staying in contact regularly and helping us to prepare fully for our wedding. A highlight of ours was our menu tasting - it was like a private dining experience and the food was unreal!

The food was amazing, from the canapés to the wedding breakfast, and everyone commented on how much they loved it!
We were quite literally waited on the entire day and the staff in particular (especially Aidan, Darren and Robert) made us feel so special and important. The layout was great as well to allow people space to sit and chat, but also plenty of room at the dance floor - especially for our Ceilidh which went down an absolute treat!

Thanks to Citation, we had the perfect wedding day from start to finish. You helped create memories for us which will last a lifetime and every time we walk past, we will be reminded of how we celebrated the most important day of our lives in one of Glasgow’s most iconic and memorable venues."
V505,Citation Weddings & Events.,"Our wedding at Citation was perfect, we couldn’t have asked for a more relaxed day! Hannah, Aidan and Casey and the rest of the staff on the day did such a fantastic job in making sure everything ran smoothly, if anything went wrong then we had no idea!
We had so many comments from guests about how lovely the venue was, the delicious meal and how efficient everything ran. Pauline and Hannah put our minds at ease from the very first meeting, the planning stage was not really stressful at all for us as they had everything covered and made sure no small detail was forgotten, even thinking of things that would never have crossed our minds.
Thanks again to everyone at Citation, we can’t recommend them highly enough!"
V505,Citation Weddings & Events.,"Had an amazing time having our wedding at Citation. The staff were very lovely and throughout the process were great at answering our questions. We wanted to lose some of the traditional wedding elements and add in a few bits of our own, which the venue accommodated brilliantly, even though some venues won’t.

The food was great and all dietary requirements were easily catered for

Our guests even commented on how friendly, helpful and pleasant the staff were so it was great that they noticed it too and not just us as the people staff were working most directly with. They definitely went above and beyond and we are super grateful!"
V505,Citation Weddings & Events.,"We can’t thank Louize and the team at Citation enough for our incredible wedding reception party in August. We had the best night ever in this beautiful venue and felt so well looked after. Everything was so well organised we didn’t have to worry about a thing. We got so many compliments about the venue, it was just perfect! If your looking for a gorgeous city venue this is it!"
V505,Citation Weddings & Events.,"Citation was outstanding.
The staff, food and venue were amazing Highly recommend"
V505,Citation Weddings & Events.,"The venue is absolutely stunning, The city centre location is perfect for friends and family traveling distances and also perfect for more quirky unique wedding photos.

The team were amazing at ensuring the day went smoothly and the quality of everything was just exceptional.

Louize was fantastic at planning the entire day we cannot thank everyone enough for making our day so special."
V505,Citation Weddings & Events.,Amazing day organised by an incredible team! Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a stunning venue and a brilliant package. No issues on the day and everything ran so smoothly with the help of Louize and her team. Great price for everything that you get. We had the best day and can’t thank them all enough for their attention to detail and constant reassurance throughout the planning stages.
V505,Citation Weddings & Events.,"We married at Citation on August 19th this year and were over the moon with our day and night. From the start Louize was amazing, so professional and helpful. Citation is a beautiful venue and on the day Natalie and me and all of our guests were blown away. We had our dream wedding and cannot thank Louize and all the team for making the occasion unforgettable - thank you guys !"
V505,Citation Weddings & Events.,"We had our day at Citation on the 1st of August 2022 having previously switched venue from 29 Glasgow. Louize and the team are an absolute credit to Citation, Louize in particular is amazing, so accommodating, friendly and most importantly so knowledgeable and competent she really takes the pressure off and allows the couple to enjoy the planning of their day as well as the day itself. Citation is absolutely breath-taking, such a beautiful venue in the middle of Glasgow I cannot think of a single other place that could compare. The entire day of my wedding I had guests talking about how beautiful the venue was and how wonderful the staff were. The master of ceremonies was a gentleman and instantly put an anxious bride at ease! I can never thank you all enough, you absolutely gave me the day I have always dreamt of and with a team that made us feel first class all day"
V505,Citation Weddings & Events.,"Citation were fantastic from start to finish. No query was too small, no question too silly. Louize was always approachable and professional and ensured the full day tan like clockwork. The venue is stunning and every guest commented on its unique vibe and lovely atmosphere. I would not change a thing about our day!"
