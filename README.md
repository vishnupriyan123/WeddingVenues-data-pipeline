---

## 🚀 Features

### 1️⃣ Automated Data Pipeline
- Scrapes wedding venue listings from **Hitched.co.uk** using **Selenium + ChromeDriver**
- Handles **pagination** and **dynamic content** seamlessly
- Runs daily at **4:30 AM UTC / 10:00 AM IST** via **GitHub Actions** (CRON-based)
- Uploads cleaned data (JSON + CSV) and logs as downloadable **GitHub Artifacts**

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Standardization
- Cleans missing or inconsistent values using **Pandas**
- Parses prices, review counts, and capacity fields into standardized formats
- Stores:
  - `cleaned_venues.csv`: latest version for dashboards
  - `cleaned_venues_YYYYMMDD.csv`: timestamped for historical reference

### 3️⃣ Logging & Traceability
- Generates detailed logs for both scraper and cleaner:
  - `scraper_log.txt`
  - `cleaner_log.txt`
- Includes timestamp, row count, and error handling info
- Logs are archived and uploaded as **workflow artifacts**

### 4️⃣ Visualization & AI-Powered Analysis
- 📊 `analyzer.py`: Static charts with **Matplotlib**/**Seaborn**
- 🤖 `ai-data-viz.py`: Natural language dashboard built with **Streamlit** and **Together AI**
  - Ask questions like _"Show average price by location"_
  - Visualizations generated by LLMs (supports **LLaMA 3**, **Qwen**, **DeepSeek**, etc.)
  - All charts are downloadable as PNG

### 5️⃣ Modularity & Version Control
- Clean and modular project structure
- GitHub-managed `.gitignore` excludes environment, logs, images, and temporary files
- Organized folders:
  - `main/data/raw/`: Scraped JSON (latest + historical)
  - `main/data/processed/`: Cleaned CSV (latest + historical)
  - `main/logs/`: Run logs
  - `main/plots/`: Output charts
- All code split into modular scripts:
  - `scraper.py`, `cleaner.py`, `analyzer.py`, `ai-data-viz.py`
